Received November 7 , 1861 , -Read January 9 , 1862 .
I AM indebted to the courtesy of Captain WASHINGTON , R.N. , Hydrographer to the Navy , for the opportunity I have had of investigating the tides of Port Leopold .
Having heard that I was engaged in the discussion of the Arctic Tides , he kindly placed at my disposal the observations made on board Her Majesty 's Ship 'Investigator , ' during the expedition of 1848-49 , under the orders of Sir JAMES C. Ross , R.N. , in search of Sir JOHN FRANKLIN .
The ' Investigator ' was anchored , or rather fast in the ice , during the winter of 1848 , in Port Leopold , North Somerset , lat. 74 ?
N. , long .
900 W. , in three fathoms water ; and the observations on the tides were made by Lieut. FREDERICK ROBINSON , whose care and skill in observing are highly to be commended .
By carefully laying down the daily high and low waters , I have succeeded in completely separating the Diurnal from the Semidiurnal Tide , and in resolving each tide into the portions due respectively to the action of the Sun and of the Moon .
In the following discussion of the Diurnal Tide , I shall first give the results of the actual observations , when graphically laid down , and afterwards draw the inferences which appear to follow from them , when compared with theory .
The mode of reduction used by me will be evident from an inspection of the MS .
diagrams which accompany this paper .
The following Table contains the Range of Diurnal Tide at High and at Low Water , and the Times of Vanishing of the Diurnal Tide at High and at Low Water .

10 18 50 23 23 20 To render more evident the LJaw of range of Diurnal Tide , I here give in Plate X. figs. I. and II .
, a graphical representation of the first two columns of the preceding Table , by means of which the relation of the range of Diurnal Tide , at High and Low Water , to the Solstices and Equinoxes is made apparent .
There is no difficulty in understanding , as will be presently shown , why the Diurnal Tide should reach a maximum at the Solstices , and a minimum at the Equinoxes , as is shown by the curves for High and Low Water , because the Solar Diurnal Tide vanishes at the Equinoxes , and consequently the equinoctial Diurnal Tide is due solely to the Moon , while the Solstitial Diurnal Tide is due to the united action of both Sun and Moon .
The following Tables II .
and III .
show the interval between the vanishing of the Diurnal Tide and the time of the vanishing of the Moon 's Declination .
In this equation D is theheight of the Diumrnal Tide , in feet .
S and M are the coefficients , in feet , of the Solar and Lunar Diurnal Tides .
o ; and p , are the Declinations of the Sun and Moon , at a period preceding the moment of observation , by an unknown interval to be determined for each luminary , and called the Age of the Solar and Lunar Diurnal Tide .
s and m are the hour-angles ; of the Sun and Moon , west of the meridian , at the time of observation .
, i , and im are the Diurnal Solitidal and Lunitidal intervals , or the times which elapse between the Sun and Moon 's southing , and the time of Solar and Lunar Diurnal High Water .
At any time near the Equinox , the declination a of the Sun is either zero or very small , and therefore D will vanish when i , the Moon 's declination , vanishes , and this will happen at both High and Low Water , or at any other time of the day ; therefore at the equinoxes the vanishing of the diurnal tide at the time of High or of Low Water ought to be sensibly the same ; but at the time of the Solstices , both members of the right-hand side of equation ( 1 .
) will have sensible values , and the Diurnal Tide will vanish when these members are equal and of opposite signs ; therefore , to find the time of vanishing of the Diurnal Tide , we have M sin 2c cos ( m-i,.sin ( 2 .
) At the time of High Water , m , the moon 's hour-angle is sensibly constant , or at least varies within narrow limits ; also , since the vanishing of the Diurnal Tide at High Water occurs at intervals of about a semilunation , the moon 's declination , - , , at each vanishing of the Diurnal Tide will also vary within small limits ; hence in passing from the equinox to the solstice , .
the right-hand side of ( 2 .
) will have its change of value depending chiefly on the change of oa ; and it will therefore diminish as a increases ; therefore cos ( s-i , ) will diminish , and ( s-is ) increase ; but s is the hour-angle of the Sun at the time of High Water , and increases day by day ( 48 " mean ) ; therefore as we approach the Solstice , the day on which we are to expect the Diurnal Tide to vanish at the time of High Water will occur later and later .
But at the time of Low Water the angles s and m must be increased by 90 ?
or 6 hours ; and therefore ( 2 .
) becomes M sin 2-p sin ( i-'i ) sin ( s-Q - .
sin 2 .
( 3 .
) By reasoning similar to that used with respect to equation ( 2 .
) , we can show that sin ( sis ) diminishes in passing from the Equinox to the Solstice , and therefore that ( s-is ) also diminishes ; therefore the time of vanishing of the Diurnal Tide at the time of Low Water occurs earlier and earlier as we approach the Solstice .
We thus see that the times of vanishing at High and Low Water move in opposite directions , and 247 become most widely separated at the time of the Solstice .
This result agrees perfectly with the facts of observation at Port Leopold recorded in Table IV .
and the accompanying fig. III .
Plate XI .
I shall now endeavour to separate , in the Diurnal Tide , the effects of the Sun and Moon .
In equation ( 1 .
) , the effect of the Sun , represented by the first member of the right-hand side of the equation , when observed at High Water , may be considered to owe its periodical change almost altogether to the change in cos ( s-i- ) , the angle s increasing day by day as the tide becomes later and later ; for the angle 6 may be regarded as sensibly constant during the semilunation .
On the other hand , the Lunar portion of the Diurnal Tide owes its change to the change of p , the moon 's declination , for the angle ( m-im ) is sensibly constant .
The Solar Diurnal Tide disappears at the equinox , because then &lt; o=0 ; hence we may find the Lunar Diurnal Tide , at that period of the year , uncomplicated by the coexistence of the Solar Tide .
Taking the means of the Diurnal Tide Ranges at High and Low Water for March and April * , I find At High Water D= 1462 ft.=M sin ( 2p , ) .
cos ( m-i ) ; at Low Water D= 0852 ft.=M sin ( 2 ) .
cos ( m-im+ 900 ) , m denoting the moon 's hour-angle at High Water , and ^p denoting the moon 's maximum declination .
Dividing one of these equations by the other , we find 1P462 cot(m-i ) =-8s2 ; .
* *. .
( 4 .
) from which we deduce m-im=149 ' 46'=10h 19111 mn , the moon 's hour-angle at High Water , is shown by the observations made in March and April to have at New and Full Moon a mean value of 12h Om .
Substituting this value in the preceding equation , I obtain , ( 1 ) The Lunitidal Diurnal Interval=i , ,=l1 41m11 .
The coefficient M of the Lunar Diurnal Tide may be found as follows : Let H=Range of Diurnal Tide , at High Water , at the equinox .
Let L=Range of Diurnal Tide , at Low Water , at the equinox .
Then 2M sin 2 ( max .
declination of moon)=-/ H2+L2 ... . .
( 5 .
) Substituting in this equation the values of H , L , and p , we find 2M sin 370=V/ ( l-462)2+(0-862)21=l692 feet ; and therefore , finally , ( 2 ) Coefficient of Lunar Diurnal Tide =M=1'409 feet .
The Age of the Lunar Diurnal Tide is found by examining the interval , at the Equinox , from the vanishing of the Moon 's declination to the vanishing of the Diurnal Tide , at High and at Low Water .
The interval from the Moon 's declination vanishing to the Tide vanishing is given in Tables II .
and III .
for High and Low Water ; and the figs. IV .
and V. of Plate XI .
represent the results of those Tables .
Fronl these figures , or from the Tables which they represent , it is evident that the difference in the time of vanishing of the Diurnal Tide at the times of High and Low Water is not altogether due to the Solar Tide ; for at the Equinox , when the Solar Tide has disappeared , the Age of the Lunar Diurnal Tide at High Water is id 21h , while the Age of the same Tide at Low Water is only Od 21h ; showing a permanent difference of one whole day in the times of disappearance of the Tide at High and Low Water quite independent of the Solar Tide , which , as I have already shown , tends to increase this difference as we approach the Solstices .
The Means of the Ages of the Diurnal Tide , taken from the Tides of the 13th and 25th of March and the 6th of April , 1849 , at High Water , and from the Tides of the lth and 24th of March and the 5th of April , 1849 , at Low Water , are id 21h and Od 211 * .
I am unable to explain why the Age of the Lunar Diurnal Tide at High Water should be greater than its Age at Low Water ; but there is good reason to believe that it is an established fact , as I found the same kind of difference of Age in the Tidal Observations made in 1850-51 , on the coasts of Ireland , by the Royal Irish Academy .
The following Table shows the difference in the Irish stations .

In order to effect this object , I laid down the Lunar Tide , both at High and Low Water , from the preceding constants , on the observed Diurnal Tide at the time of the Solstices , and thus obtained the constants of the Solar Tide , which at those periods of the year is a maximum .
Having thus constructed the Lunar Tide , I found , by the difference between it and the Observed Diurnal Tide , that the maximum Solar Diurnal Tide was as follows : Range of Solidiurnal Tide at High Water : Summer Solstice , 1849 .

261 It will be observed in the preceding Table , that the time of the Diurnal Solar Tide , vanishing may be referred to one or other of two hours , which differ by 12h , and that the times of passing from + to at the two solstices are reversed .
These changes are evident from the consideration of the expression .
for the Solar Diurnal Tide , S sin 2o .
cos(s-i , ) , which changes sign , from Solstice to Solstice , by the change of sign of ( a ) , the sun 's declination , and also changes sign at the two high waters or low waters of the same day by the increment " of 1800 which the sun 's hour-angle s undergoes .
Combining all the results together , I find that the Solar Diurnal Tide vanishes at High Water when 8h 26m-..=18h and 20h -=6h , or ijs b9h 34m , and +1411 .
Mean value of is= 41i I3m ; and that the Solar Diurnal Tide vanishes at Low Water when 7h 57m-is181 , and 19h 48mis= 6l1 o jlOh 3m , and +13h 48m .
Mean value of ij= 13h 52m 30S , The Mean of the values of the Solitidal Interval , at High and Low Water , is is= 14h 2m 45S .
From the preceding data we can readily find the coefficient of the Solar Diurnal Tide ; SX sin ( max .
declination of Sun ) =0 867 feet , or S= 8 =1-186 feet .
sin ( 470 ) The Age of the Solar Diurnal Tide cannot be deduced from observations such as those under discussion , because the Sun 's declination changes so slowly at the Solstices , that it may be considered constant during a fortnight , and therefore the Coefficient S sin(2oa ) is also constant during that period .
The Constants of the Solar Diurnal Tide , as just found , are as follow:1 .

The theory which I select for this purpose is that given by Mr. AIRY in his ' Tides and Waves , ' which is considerably in advance of that given by LAPLACE and the earlier mathematicians , and , as it is directly founded on the motion of water in canals , seems particularly well adapted to the discussion of a tide like that of Port Leopold , which is situated at the extreme northern end of the Atlantic Ocean , which may be regarded as a Canal occupying a meridian circle , and nearly 10,000 miles in length .
From the discussion of the Diurnal Tide , in a meridian canal , given by Mr. AIRY ( Tides and Waves , p. 356 ) , it may be deduced that the following equation is true , and that it contains the means of finding the mean depth of the Atlantic Canal : n2b kS mass of Sun d3 gb MT mass of Moon XD3TX N2b k -* Substituting , therefore , for the symbols the following values , M-0-842 , mass of Sun mass of Moon= 359551 X 85 d 59-964 D2 x 12032 ' mass of Sun d3 mass of Moon XD = 047288 ; 7912 ==2 miles ; N12b =0-00345 ; g n-_=0 00323 ; we find k 0-00323-4 0-842=0-473 0,003454b from which I deduce k1 h-l072 k=369 miles .
In discussing the Solar and Lunar Diurnal Tides of nine stations on the Irish Coasts , I found the following results*:S M ( mean of nine Stations)-=05305 ; k1 ^=77 ; k-=5 12 miles .
The mean depth of the Atlantic Canal may be also deduced , by means of Mr. AIRY 's Theory of Tides with Friction , from a comparison of the Solitidal and Lunitidal Intervals , and from the Lunitidal Interval compared with the Age of the Lunar Tide .
According to the Theory of Tidal 'Waves without Friction , Low Water should occur at the time of the meridian passage of the luminary ; in consequence , however , of friction , the phase of High Water is accelerated by an interval equal to the difference between the Tidal Interval and half the period of a Tidal Oscillation .
According to Mr. AIRY'S Theory , taking account of friction ( supposed proportional to the horizontal velocity of the tidal current ) , the acceleration of High Water is represented byt f n2-gkrnf= coefficient of friction ; n= angular velocity of Luminary ; g=32 feet ; k=depth of the sea ; Therefore X=length of the tide-wave .
Lunitidal Acceleration N2-gkrm2 7 Solitidal Acceleration ?
-gkm2 '* and , substituting the following values , 89280._ 2 , 86400 ' 2 , r m 25000 x 5280 ' we find , k being expressed in miles , Acceleration of Lunar Diurnal Tide 13'815-k Acceleration of Solar Diurnal Tide 12-938*k( ) To find the Lunitidal and Solitidal Accelerations , we must subtract the Lunitidal and Solitidal Intervals , Zi and i , from 12h 24m and 12h , respectively ; but , = _11 41m i =13b 52m-5 ; therefore Acceleration of Lunar Diurnal Tide .
= +101 43m , Acceleration ( Retardation ) of Solar Diurnal Tide= lh 52m.5 .
Substituting these values in equation ( 8 .
) , I find k=13-07 miles .
Again , according to Mr. AIRmy 's Theory of Tidal Waves with friction* , the greatest tide follows the greatest force by an interval ( Age of Tide ) , f(n2+glm2 ) .

) * In applying this equation to determine the depth of the sea , the difficulty already noticed , as to the Age of the Lunar Tide , deduced from High Water and Low Water observations , meets us again .
The Age at High Water is 1d 21h , and at Low Water Od 211 .
Substituting these values respectively , I find miles .

The determination of Heights of the Solar and Lunar Diurnal Tide by observation is more accurate than the determination of Acceleration and Age .
2nd .
The theory by which the'depth of the sea is deduced from Heights is independent of friction , the introduction of which requires additional hypotheses , which are , at best , of a doubtful character .
At the same time it should be remarked that the depth of the sea deduced from Acceleration and Age , at eight stations on the coasts of Ireland , exceeded the 'depth deduced from Heights , in a manner similar to that which is found to occur at Port Leopold .

11-32 In the present state of our knowledge of the Theory of the Tides , I think it is safer to adopt the results deduced from Heights as the most reliable , and to wait until mathematical researches shall have furtherperfected the Theory of friction inTidal Waves , before we draw conclus"ions from it as to the , depth of the sea , especially when we consider that this Theory has not yet explained the anomaly discovered by observation as to the difference in Age of the Diurnal Tides deduced from High and Low Waters .
II.--The Semidiurnal Tides of Port Leopold , North Somerset .
Received October 8 , -Read November 27 , 1862 .
When the daily height of High and Low Water has been cleared of the Diurnal Tide , as explained in Part I. , and as is shown in the MS .
diagrams that accompany this paper , it is easy to estimate the successive Heights of Spring and Neap Tides , cleared of the Diurnal Tide .
Bringing together the Spring Tides and the Neap Tides , the following Tables I. and II .
are constructed ; and from the second column of these Tables the diagram No. 1 Plate XII .
is prepared , of which the following explanation may be useful .
The interval in the abscisse corresponds to five Lunar weeks , or intervals between the greatest Spring Tide and least Neap Tide .
The ordinates are divided , as usual , into feet .
The Curve a , drawn through alternate Spring Tide Heights , is the curve of New Moon Springs .
The Curve a ' is the Curve of Full Moon Springs .
The Curve b is the Curve of First Quarter Neap Tides .
The Curve V ' is the Curve of Third Quarter Neaps .
These Curves are constructed from Tables I. and II .
, which are themselves formed from the Curves of the MS .
diagram .
The diagram No. 2 , Plate XII .
is formed from the first column of Table I. Its abscissa are the same as those of diagram No. 1 , and its ordinates are the Solar Hours at which the Maximum Spring Tide occurred .
Curve a represents the Time of New Moon Springs .

The general expression for the Semidiurnal Tides is , as is well known , T=.S( ) cos2 cos 2 ( s-is)+M ( C)cos p cos 2 ( -i). .
( 1 .
) where S and M are the Solar and Lunar Coefficients ; P and p the Solar and Lunar parallax ; and P , , _p the mean values of the same .
a , ^ the declinations of the Sun and Moon , at periods preceding that of observation by unknown intervals called the Solar and Lunar Age of the Semidiurnal Tide .
s , m the hour-angles of the Sun and Moon , west of the meridian at the time of observation .
i , , ij the Solar and Lunar Tidal intervals , or time after southing of the luminary , at which its high water is found to occur .
From an inspection of diagrams 1 and 2 , Plate XII .
, it is plain that the conditions of the tide are different at New and Full Moon , and in the Ist and 3rd Quarter .
But the Solar conditions may be supposed constant for a fortnight , and as the moon 's declination only enters equation ( 1 .
) by the square of the cosine , it must be q. p. the same at the beginning and end of a Lunar fortnight .
The difference , therefore , shown in the diagrams must depend on the Moon 's Parallax , which takes four weeks to complete its changes .
From diagram No. 1 , it appears that the greatest difference in the Parallactic Tide , between the opposite quarters of the Moon , both at Spring and Neap Tides , amounts to I *47 ft. in the range of the Tide .
shall presently prove that the Lunar Tide Range at the time of this maximum Parallactic inequality is 4-62 ft. ; adding , to this , half the Parallactic inequality , and subtracting it from it , we find 533 89( ( me)..**.* *(2 .
) that is , the cube of the ratio of the Apogee to the Perigee .
Solving this equation for e , the eccentricity of the moon 's orbit , we obtain e= i2= 5303.5 ... ... . .
( 3 .
) This value of the eccentricity of the moon 's orbit is very near the true value 0*05484* , as near , indeed , as could be expected from any Tidal Observations .
B.-Solar Sernidiurnal Tide .
In diagram No. 1 the Curves marked A and B are drawn so as to eliminate the Parallactic inequality , and they represent the Curves of Spring and Neap Tide Ranges ; but from the expression ( 1 ) it appears that if we could find two sets of tides , for which the moon 's declination and hour-angle should be the -same , we could eliminate the Lunar Tide and calculate the Solar Tide separately .
These conditions are fulfilled by the Solstitial Springs and Equinoctial Neaps-as may be thus shown .

And the Curve of Spring Tide Range , cleared of Parallax , attains its Solstitial Minimum , June 21d 12h 40m H.W. , and its Equinoctial Maximum , April Id 12h 20in L.W. We may therefore safely assume the part of equation ( 1 .
) which depends on the Moon to be the same at both these times .
We therefore have a ' =2S .
cos2 cos 2(d -i , )+2M cos2 cos 2(m ' --i ) , a , ,=2S .
cos2 a , , cos 2(s , ,-i , )+2M cos2 cos2(m , ,-im)J where a ' , d , s ' , i , ; m ' refer to Solstitial Springs , a ' being the Solstitial Spring Range ; and a , , , , , , s , , , p , , , m , , refer to Equinoctial Neaps , a , , being the Equinoctial Neap Range .
But a ' =5-56 ft. a , =2 67 ft. Subtracting from each other the two equations ( 4 .
) ; we find ( a ' a , ,)=2S[cos2e ' cos 2(s-s)-ciose- , , cos2 -i ) ... .

( 13 .
) C.-Lunar Semidiurnal Tide .
The constants of the Solar Tide being found , ( 9 .
) and ( 13 .
) , nothing was easier than to calculate its amount at each Spring and Neap , and to subtract it from the former and add it to the latter .
In this way the curves ( a ) and ( 3 ) , diagram No. 1 , were constructed , and represent the Lunar Semidiurnal Tide Range at Springs and Neaps respectively .
2N2 2`5 Its maximum and minimum amounts are Maximum Lunar Range=4 62 ft. Minimum Lunar Range=4-23 ft. If a and c ' denote the maximum and minimum Lunar Ranges which correspond with the Spring and Neap Tides of either the Solstice or Equinox , and if mn and n ' denote the hour-angles of the moon at these tides , we have , if I=18-| to 190 be the inclination of moon 's orbit , a =2M cos2 I. cos 2(m -*i .

U'=2M cos2(0 ) cos 2(n.(14 .

Substituting the value of im in the second of equations ( 14 .

( 16 .
) I have not been able to deduce from the observations any close approximation to the Age of the Lunar Tide , but think it is probably rather over than under five days .
It would require more observations than the heights of high and low water toAdetermine this important constant with accuracy .
D.-.Mass of the Mooln and Depth of the Sea deducible from thze Senidiurnal Tide .
According to the Statical Theory of the Tides , excluding the terms depending on Parallax , Declination , Hour of Tide , &amp;c. , the ratio of the Solar to the Lunar coefficient is as follows:-S mass of Sun d\3 1 M~ mass of Moon .
D 5D '*( ) 260 where D and d denote the mean distances of the Sun and Moon from the Earth .
Hence we find mass of Sun S ( D\3 mass of MoonMX\d ) 8( 2x 12032\3 MX 59964 But since S=l-705 , and M=4-309 , we have.=0-3956 , ... ... ... ( 18 .
) and , finally , mass of Sun mass of Moon=359551X 71:11 ... ... .
( 19 .
) From which we deduce the mass of the Moon to be 1--th of that of the Earth .
From the Dynamical Theory of the Tides given by Mr. AIRY ( Tides and Waves , p. 357 ) , the ratio of S to Ml , for the Semidiurnal Tide , is the following:n2b kS mass of Sun d\3 bM mass of Moonx D XN2b k ' ( 20 .
) gb where N and n are the angular velocities of the Sun and Moon , k , b the mean depth of sea and radius of earth , and g the force of gravity .
Substituting for these quantities their usual values , we find &lt; S 0*00323-k M-=047288 x 000345-k or s=-047288 X 12778 k(21 .
) M4o13 &amp; 648.(k ' .
Substituting for hr its value 0*3956 , we obtain by solving for k , k= depth of sea = 8-32 miles ... ... ( 22 .
) Whatever doubt may attach to this high value of the mean depth of the Atlantic Canal , and to the depths 13-07 miles and 6-07 miles obtained from the Diurnal Tide in Part I. , should properly be considered as belonging to the imperfect condition of the Theory of Canals of equal depth , as applied to such a body of water as the Atlantic Ocean , and not to the observations .
It is , however , well worthy of remark , that we can obtain from the Solitidal and Lunitidal Intervals a value for the mean depth of the sea that is much more probable , and is also very close to the depth derived from the ratio of S to M in the Diurnal Tide .
If we call the Acceleration of the Tide the difference between the Tidal Interval and 261 iAUGHTON ON THE TIDES OF THE the period of half a Tide Oscillation , we find , from Mr. AIRY 's Theory , the following equation for the Semidiurnal Tide : Lunitidal Acceleration N2-gkrm2 23 Solitidal Acceleration rn2-gkm'2 ' ** ( where 2 .
or Lunitidal Acceleration 138 15-4k Solitidal Acceleration 12-938-4k ' ( 24 .
) Substituting in this equation , hmhmm Lunitidal Acceleration =6 12-4 54= 78 , Solitidal Acceleration ==6 0-0 56=304 , we find 78 13-815-4k 304 12-938 -4k ' and , finally , 3190-6 k= = =3-529 miles .
From what we know , independently of the Tides , of the depth of the Atlantic Ocean , this value , and that found from the ratio of S to M in the Diurnal Tide , will seem nearer the truth than the higher values found from other considerations .
From this it may be inferred that the theory of Tides , with friction , in these two cases , comes nearer to the truth than it does in the other cases from which the higher values are derived .
I do not know why this is so , and would recommend the fact to the notice of those mathematicians who are conversant with the Theory of the Tides .
Her Majesty 's Ship ' Investigator ' was secured in her Winter position by Noon of the 18th day of October , the Moon 's Age being 21 days .

Diagram accompanying this Paper , referred to in paye 243 .
This diagram was formed by laying down on ruled paper the observations of height recorded in the Tables of Observation .
The alternate high waters were then joined by lines , forming two curves , the distance between which is double the Diurnal Tide at the time of High Water .
The same construction was made for the Low Waters .
As the Diurnal Tide vanishes with the declination , the equinoctial Diurnal Tide is altogether Lunar ; accordingly the Lunar Diurnal Tide was found from the equinoctial portion of the diagram .
When found , it was superposed on the Solstitial portion of the diagrams , the points of intersection being found by means of the interval from -=0 to D-=0 , or age of tide already obtained from the equinoctial observations .
The part of the diurnal curves remaining , after the superposition of the Lunar Tide , was the Solar Diurnal Tide .
The Lunar and Solar Tides at High and Low Water having been thus found , their remaining constants , viz. Coefficients and Tidal Intervals , were worked out , as shown in the paper itself .
A Curve , drawn bisecting the range of the Diurnal Tide at High Water , and another curve in like manner at Low Water , give the High and Low Water Curves of the Semidiurnal Tides that I have used in the second part of my paper on the Arctic Tides .
This part of the subject is given in detail in the paper itself .
