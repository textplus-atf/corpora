There is perhaps no other compound known which has been so often and so fully investigated by different chemists , and yet whose constitution is clouded in so much obscurity , as the alcohol which is obtained by distilling castor-oil soap with caustic alkalies .
Fromn the time of its discovery until recently , this compound has been alterniately considered by one investigator to be capryl or octyl alcohol , and by another to colnsist of cenanthyl or heptyl alcohol .
As a proof that it is capryl alcohol , Bouis states that , by the moderate action of nitric acid , a small quantity of caprylic acid is produced , the greater part of the alcohol , however , being oxidized to lower members of the fatty acid series* ; and Kolbe concludes , from the formation of these acids , that it is a secondary or isoalcohol , probably methyl-hexyl carbinol , CC 61-113 t. As I shall show in this paper , Kolbe 's view is correct ; by mode rate oxidation , the alcohol loses two atoms ofx hydrogen , and is convrerted into the corresponding acetonle , methyl cenanthol , the same compound which isgenerally obtained as a byep roduct in the preparation of the alcohol .
The alcohol wWehi I used was prepared by distilling a mixture of castor-oil soap and caustic soda in a flask of thin copper-sheeting as quickly as possible .
The distillate was repeatedly rectified over fused caustic potash , the portion boiling below 2000 C. only being collected .
The alcohol was isolated from this liquid by tractional distillation ; its corrected boiling-point was 18 1 C. The portionis having a lower boiling-point consist of hydrocarbons , which combine with brominie , probably members of the olefine ceries , amongst which octylene , boiling at 1250 C. , preponderates .
A considerable q aintity of liquid distilled above 1600 , the boiling-point remaining som-newhat constant at 1 700 C. Neither this fraction nior any other distillate contained an acetone , as none combined with hydrogell-sodium sulphite .
According to Chapman , the liquid boiling at 170 ?
consists chiefly of heptvl alcohol* .
In order to isolate this alcohol , I acted upon the liquid boiling between 1609 i 730 with iodine and phosphorus .
The product , subjected to fraction.al distillation , was found to consist of isoctyl iodide , boiling at 21 0 ?
-2 1 i5 and of hydrocarbonis , distilling below 1600 ; the portion which came over between 160 ?
and 210 ?
was very small , and diminished after each further distillation .
This shows that no heptyl alcohol was present , and that the original liquid boiling at 170 ?
was a mixture of isoctyl alcohol and hydrocarbons , which could not be separated by simple fractioninug To obtaini the oxidation products of isoctyl alcohol , I acted upon it with a solution consisting of 3 parts of sulphuric acid , 2 parts of potassium bichromate , and 10 parts of water , the reaction being moderated by surrounding the vessel with cold water .
As sooln as no further action was observed , the liquid was distilled .
The distillate consisted of an aqueous liquid , which had a slight acid reaction , and a light oily fluid ; it was neutralized with sodium carbonate , and the oil treated again with the oxidizing mixture , which , however , had hardly anty action upon it in the cold .
This oily liquid is miethyl cenantbol ; it has the characteristic odour of that compound , and when shaken with a concentrated solution of hydrogensodium sulphite , solidifies to a mass of pearly white crystals .
These were dried between blottin , g-paper , and decomposed by a dilute solution of caustic soda .
The oil which separated was dried over caleium chloride ; it distilled completely between I 70'-l 72 ' , the boiling-point of methyl oemnanthol being 171 ?
e In order to oxidize this coimpound further , it had to be heated with the oxidizing mixture , when a slight evolution of carbon dioxide was observed .
The acid distillate was neutralized with sodium carbonate , and the acetone unacted upon treated again as before .
The different solutions of the sodium-salts were evaporated , and the solid residue decormposed by diluted sulphuric acid .
Any oily acid separated , which , after drying , distilled at 1980-2000 , which is the boiling-point of caproic acid , the characteristic odour of which it also exhibited .
To place beyonid doubt that it was really this compound , a portioni of it was lciitralized with : ammonia and precipitated by silver nitrate .
A white curdy precipitate was obtained , which was nearly insoluble in cold water , and only slightly soluble in boiling water .
It did not darken either by exposLure to the light or to a temperature of 100 ? .
Fromr the hot saturated soluttion it separated as a crystalline powder ; nior couIld I obtain it in definite crystals by evaporating the solution in vacuo .

Besides caproic acid , a large quantity of acetic acid was formed , which was isolated by distilling the aqueous liquid from which the caproic acid had been removed .
With the first portion of the distillate , oily drops of caproic acid came over ; the latter portion- , which was collected separately , had the pure odour of acetic acid ; it was rectified twice , and the last portion collected , which was boiled with silver carbonate .

This alcohol yields , on oxidation , first , the corresponding acetone , methyl oeaianthol , C C3 13 which , under further oxidation , splits 0 up into caproic and acetic acid , exactly as the theory requires .
Another question to be answered was , what is the structure of the group TIexyl C6 113 , contained in this isoalcohol ?
The caproic acid conitained in fats and that prepared from amyl cyanide appear to be identical with that which I obtained ' .
Now , according to Erlenimeyer , in the amyl compounds the carbon atoms are grouped in the following manner : * Ann. cler Chem.und Phario .

v Caproic acid deviates the ilane of the polarized light , whilst that from cocoa-nutCC C C , and this grouping must therefore also exist in caproic acid and in isoctyl alcohol .
To obtain evidence respecting this question , I coniverted the alcohol into the corresponding hydride by a very simple mnethod , which is a general one , and by which , with the greatest ease , the corresponding hydrocarbon can be obtained from any alcohol .
Tlle alcohol was first converted into the iodide , which was brought together with zinc turrnings and diluted hydrochloric acid in a flask which was surrounided with cold water .
After a few hours the heavy layer of iodide had disappeared , and a light liquid swam on the top .
This consisted almost entirely of the hydrocarbon C8 -1 , , ; traces of iodide and alcohol whicbh still adhered were removed by treating the liquid with sulphluric and nlitric acids , and by distilling it over sodium .
The pure hydrocarboni boils constantly at 1240 C. , and has the specific gravity 9-7083 at 12'05 .
0-2870 of this liquid gave 0 8840 CO2 and 04150 I-120 .

, contains one carbon atom , which is comibined with 3 others , or the carboni atoms are grouped in a similar mianniier as in the anmyl compounds .
The structure of isoctyl alcohol will therefore most probably be expressed by the following formula C11-3 Cl-I3\ / CC 1.1 CH~ C 112 CH2 CII 01-1 I cU3I oil is inactive .
This physical difference is most probably caused by a different arrangement of tho miolecules , and not by a diffcrent grouping of the atoms in the molecule .
By distilling sebacic acid with cauistic baryta , Rich * obtained the hydrocarbon Cs H,1 v which boiled at 127 ? .
Rich , however , did not obtain this compound in a pure state .
I prepared this hydrocarbonl in the same way , and found that the distillate is a mixture of different compounds , just as is the case when suberic and azelaic acids are distilled with barytat .
The pure hydrocarboll , isolated from this mixture by means of strong acids and so on , boils at 1230-1250 , and has the same specific gravity as that from isotyl alcohol , viz. 0 7083 at 12 ?
05 .
These two hydrocarbons appear , therefore , to be identical , and the carbon atomis in sebacic acid must also be arranged in a simnilar manner as in isoetyl alcohol .
The secondary amyl and octyl alcohols may be coinsidered to he derived from the tertiary butyl alcohol , in a similar maniner as the hutyl and amyl alcohols formed by fermenitation from the seconidary propyl alcohol , viz. BoilingDifferpoinlt .
