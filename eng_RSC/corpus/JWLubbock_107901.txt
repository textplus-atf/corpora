On the pendulum .
By J. W. LUBBOCK , Esq. F.R.S. Read March 11 , 1830 .
CAPTAIN KATER was the first who made use of HUYGENS'S theorem with respect to the convertibility of the centres of suspension and oscillation to eliminate the moment of inertia , and to obtain the length of the simple pendulum by measuring the distance between the knife edges or axes of suspension .
But this very ingenious method of determining the length of the simple pendulum must be considered as a first approximation , which is true only when many circumstances which might affect the truth of the result are not taken into account , but of which the following investigation shows that when the experiments are conducted with care , the effect is insensible .
It is , however , desirable to ascertain carefully the limits of the errors which may rise from the circumstances to which I have alluded , and to render the theory of Captain KATER'S pendulum as perfect as the method of observation .
LAPLACE has given a complete theory of the apparatus used by BORDA in the Connaissance des Temps ; and he has shown that in the apparatus of Captain KATER , the distance between the knife edges is equal to the length of the simple pendulum , when they are considered as cylinders of small curvature , provided their radii of curvature are equal ; which theorem is also proved in Professor WHEWELL'S Dynamics .
But no one I believe has yet discussed all the circumstances which affect the accuracy of Captain KATER 's method ; and I have therefore attempted to do this in the following paper , in which I have treated the question with the utmost generality , taking the case of all possible deviations and of axes any how placed , provided only that they are synchronous .
I have taken the pendulum used by Mr. BAILEY , and described by him in the Philosophical Magazine of last February , to afford a numerical example , and I have given the errors which would arise in the length of the simple pendulum corresponding to given deviations of the knife edges : it is difficult to make the results intelligible without the use of symbols ; but I may add , that the effect of a small deviation of one of the knife edges in azimuth is quite insensible : this is not the case with a deviation in altitude a deviation of a degree in altitude increases by 3 the vibrations in twenty-four hours a deviation from horizontality in the agate planes has a more sensible influence than either of the former deviations : a deviation in horizontality in the agate planes of It ' increases by about 6 the vibrations in twenty-four hours : both these deviations have the effect of rendering the distance between the knife edges greater than the true length of the simple pendulum .
I have also considered the case in which the agate planes are fixed on the pendulum and vibrate on a fixed knife edge ; and I find , as might be expected , that the length of the simple pendulum is equal to the distance between the planes .
Let 0x , Oy , 0z be rectangular coordinate axes meeting in the point 0 in the plane ( x y ) , upon which the pendulum rests ; let the plane ( x z ) be vertical and the plane ( x y ) nearly horizontal , and let the axis of rotation coincide with the line Ox. Let g be the force of gravity , a the angle which a vertical line makes with the axis Oz , a the distance of the centre of gravity from the line Ox , and M ( a2 + k2 ) the moment of inertia of the pendulum about the axis Ox ; then , according to the analysis of M. 1PO0ISSON , ( TraitM de M6canique , p. 116 .
) the length of the simple pendulum which oscillates in the same timqe a cos ?
Let G &lt; x , Gy , G z , be the three principal axes which intersect each other in the point G , and let the equations to the axis Ox referred to the coordinate axes G x , , Gy , , G z , , which are fixed in the pendulum and move with it , be x , = tan +F tan 81 %X = CO c 7 .
; and Y are small angles which may be considered as the deviations of the knife edge in azimuth and altitude .
If ay =b x +t az=cx+y 202 are the equations to any straight line ( g ) in space , the equations to a straight line perpendicular to this line , and passing through the origin , are ax + by +cz0y ( a bx ) =f ( azc x)J and the shortest distance from the origin to the given line\/ /(3 b -y c ) +++a a !
( a2 + bM + c ) The equation to a plane passing through the origin and the given line is ry ( ay b x ) =3 ( a zc a ) and the equations to the intersection of this plane with the plane ( z y ) are yy=x 0 If ay=bx+ 3 ' a ' zc'+ y ' be the equations to any other straight line ( c ' ) in space Cs aaJa + bb ' + cdc CsO5 e *Va2 +b2+ cl Va'2 + b'2 -+ c2 Hence the cosine of the angle formed by the line g and the intersection of the plane y ( ay bx ) = ( 3 ( az cx ) with the plane zy_b+ yc / a2+ b+ cs + c ?
the sine of the same angle = A/ ( P b -c)^+ 2c aV/ a+b - ' +c ^3 + r2 IThese equations being premised ; let C be the point in the axis or knife edge , 0 x , where a perpendicular let fall upon it from the centre of gravity G cuts it ; let C ' be the point where the plane ( z y ) cuts the axis 0 x ; and let C " be the point where one of the surfaces of the pendulum , supposed a parallelepiped , cuts the same knife edge ; and let G " be the point in this surface where a perpendicular let fall from G cuts it .

I have endeavoured as far as possible to conform to the notation of M. POISSON in the Traite de Mecanique ; but this is rendered difficult , because M. POISSON sometimes takes the axis Ox to be vertical , ( vol. ii .
p. 113 , ) and sometimes the axis Oz ( as vol. ii .
p. 185 ) , and he uses the letter s in two different acceptations , ( vol. ii .
pp. 119 &amp; 185 .
