IAVING lately fixed on the discussion of the nature of inflnammation , for the subject of an academical exercise : Ifournd it Iecessary to examine attentively : the mechanical principles of the circulation of the blood , and to investigate:minutely and comprehensively the motion of fluids in pipes , as ffected by friction , the resistance occasioned by flexure , the laws of the propagation of an impulse through .
the fluid contained in an elastic tube , the magnitude of a pulsation in different parts of a conical vessel , and the effect of a contraction advancing progressively through the length of a -given canal .
The physiological application of the results of these inquiries I shall have the honour of laying before the Royal Society at a future time ; but I have thought it advisable to communicate , in a separate paper , such conclusions , as may be interesting to some persons , who do not concern themselves with disquisitions of a physiological nature ; and I imagine itmlay be as agreeable to the Society that they should be submitted at present to their consideration , as that they should be withheld until the time appointed for the delivery of the Croonian Lecture .
It has been observed by the late Professor ROBIsoN , that ihe comparison of the Chevalier DuumAT 's calculations with his experiments is in all respects extremely satisfactory ; that it exhibits a beautiful specimen of the means of expressing the general result of an extensive series of observations in an analytical formula , and that it does honour to the penetration , skill , and address of Mr. DUBUAT , and 'of Mr. DE ST .
HONORE ' , who assisted him in the construction of his expressions .
I am by no means disposed to dissent from this encomium ; and I agree with Professor RoBISON , and with all other late authors on hydraulics , in applauding the unusually accurate coincidence between these theorems and the experiments from which they were deduced .
But I have alreadytalcenrthe liberty of remarking ; in my lecture on the history of ydraulies , that the form of these expressions is by no means so conveieientfor practice as it might have been rendered ; and they are also liable , to still greater objections in particular cases , since , when the pipe : iss either extremely narrow , or extremely long , they become completely erroneous : for notwithstanding Mr. DUBUAT seems to be of opinion , that a canal may have a finite inclination , and yet the water contained in ' it may remain perfectly at rest , and that no force can be sufficient to make water flow in any finite quantity through a tube less than one twenty-fifth of an inch in diameter , it can scarcely require an argument to : show that he is mistaken in both these respects .
It was therefore necessary for my purpose to substitute , for the formulae of Mr. DuBUAT , 'others of a totally different nature ; and I could follow DUBUATy in nothing but in his general mode of considiering a part of the pressure , or .
of the height of a given reservoir , as employed in overcoming the friction .
of .
the pipe through which the water flows7 out of it ; a:principle , which , if not of his original invetiion , was certainly first .
reduced by .
him into a. practical form .
By comparing the experiments , which e has collected , with some of GERSTNER , and some of my own , I have ultimately discovered a formula , which appears to agree fuilly as well as DUBUAT 's , with the experiments from which -his rules were deduced , which accords better with GERSTNER'S experiments , which extends to all the extreme cases with equal accuracy , which seems to represent more simply the actual operation of the forces concerned , and which is : direct Jn:its application to practice , without the necessity of any successive approximations .
I began by examining the velocities of the water , discharged , through pipes of a given diameter , with different degrees of pressure ; and I found that the friction could not be represented by any single power of the velocity , although it frequently approached to the proportion of that power , of which the exponent is.8 ; but that it appeared to consist of two parts , the one varying simply as the velocity , the other as : its square .
The proportion of these parts to each other must however be considered as different , in pipes of different diameters , the first part being less perceptible in very large pipes , or in rivers , but becoming greater than the second in very minute tubes , while the second also becomes greater , for each given portion of the internal surface of the pipe , as the diameter is diminished .
If we express , in the first place , all the measures in French inches , calling the height employed in overcoming the friction f , the velocity in a second v , the diameter of the'pipe d , and its length 1 , we may make f av + - ' cv ; for itis obvious that the friction must be directly as the length of the:pipe ; and : since the pressure is proportional to the area of the section , and the surface producing the friction to its circumfeirence or.diameter , ,the:relative mqagnitude of the friCtiOn mulst also beiver ; isly as the diame ter , or , nearly .

In the mx experiments which DUBUAT has wholly rejected , the mean error of his formula is about nd , and ; that of mine 4 .
In .
fifteen of GERSTNER'S experiinents , ihe mean error of DuBUAT 's rule is one third , that of mine one fourth ; and in the three experiments which I made with very fine tubes , the errr of my own rules is one fifteenth of the whole , while in such cases DUBUAT'S formule completely fail .
I have i:etermined the mean er-ror by adding togethe-+the logarhmic ratios of all the results , and dividing thesunby the ; number of experiments .
It would be useless to seek for a mruch greater degree of accuracy , unless it were probable that the errors of the experiments themselves were less than those of the calculations ; but if a sufficient number of extremely acciEurate and frequently repeated experiments : couTd Wb otained , it would be very possible to adapt my form la 'still more correctly to their results .

Of theRes &lt; istance occaszoned by Flexure in Pipes or Rivers .
Mr. DUB .
UAT has made some experiments on the effect of the flexure of a pipe in retarding the motion of the water flowingtrough it ; but they do not appear to be by any means suffiient to authorise the conclusions which he has drawn from them .
He : directs the squares of the sines of the angles of flexure to be collected into one sum , which , being multiplied by a certain constant coefficient , and by the square of the velocity is to : show the he i ght required for overComing the esistance , &lt; It is , however , easy to ; see that such a rule must of eudamentalll erroneous , and its coincidence with some experiments merely accidental , since the results aflbrded by it must vary according to the method of stating the problem , which is entirely arbitrary .
Thus it depended only on Mr. DUBUAT to consider a pipe bent to an angle of 1440 ?
as consisting of a single flexure , as composed of two flexures of 720 each , or of a much greater number of smaller flexuresr , although the result of the experiment would only agree witfh the arbitrary division into two parts , which he has adopted .
This difficulty is attached to every mode of computing the effect either from the squares of the sines or from the sines themselves ; and the only way of avoiding it is to attend merely to the angle of flexure as expressed in degrees .
, It is natural to suppose that the effect of the curvature must increase , as the curvature itself increases , and that the retardation must 'be 'inversely 'proportional to ' the:radius of curvature , or very nearly -so ; and this supposition is sufficiently confirmed , by the experiments , which Mr. DUBUAT has employed !
in support of a theory so different .
It might be expected that an equal curvature would create a greater resistance in a larger pipe than in a smaller , since the ineqluality in themotions of the different parts of the fluid is greater ; but this circumstance does not seem to have inflitenced the results of the experiments made with pipes of an inch and of two inches diameter : there must also be Some deviation from the general law , in cases of ' very Small pipes having a great curvature , but this deviation caniiot be determined without further experiments .
Of thb2-5 w..hich DUBUxrAT has made , he has rejected 10 as irregular,.becuse they do not agree with his theory : indeed 4 of them , which were made:with a much shorter pipe than the rest , differ , so manifestly from them that they cannot be reconciled : .
: but ; othersagree sufficiently , as well as all the rest , with thethepry which I have here proposed , supposing the resistance to be as the angular flexure , and to increase besides almost in the same proportion as the radius of curvature diminishes , but more nearly as that power of the radius of which the index is - .
Thus if p be the number of degrees subtended at the centre of 1.fl ex re , and'q:the radius of curvature of the axis of thepipe in Frenhe inches , we s^all have r nearlyor , -or more 2oooooq accurately , r. Tooooohpvq T ilhese calculations are compared-with the whole of DUBuAT 's experiments in the following table .

the properties- , of the centre of inertia .
Now if , instead of one of the surfaces , we substitute two others , converging in a very acute angle , the wave will be elevated higher and higher as itapproaches the angle : and if its height be supposed to be'every where in the inverse subduplicate ratio of the distance .
of theconverging surfaces , the magnitude of the pressure , redced , to the direcemotion the moion , will be precisely equal to that of the pressure on the single opposite surface , which wi , not happpen if the elevation vary inversely in , the simple raitio-o , o:dithe , distance , or in that of any other power than its square-root .
: .
, his mode of considering the subject affords us Aherefore an , additional reason : , for asserting , that in all Aa a ~-^79 transmissions of impulses through elastic bodies , or through gravttimg fuid , t ntnsityofthe : impuse varies , nversely in the subduplicate ratio of the extent of the parts affected t the same time ; and the same reasoning may without doubt be applied to the case of an elastic tube .
, ; There is however a very singular exception , in the case of w , aes crossing each other , to the general law of the preservationQf , ascending force , which appears to be almost sufficjient to set aside the universal application of this law to the motions of fluids .
It is confessedly demonstrable that each of two waves , crossing.each other in any direction , will preserve its motion and its elevation with respect to the surface of the fluid affected by the .
other wave , in the same manner as if that surface were plane : and , when the waves cross each other nearly in the same direction , both the height and the actual velocity of the particles being doubled , it is obvious that the ascending force or impetus is also doubled , since the bulk of the matter concerned is only halved , while the square of the velocity is quadrupled ; and supposing the double wave to be stopped by an obstacle , its magnitude , at the moment of the greatest elevation , will be twice as great as that of a single wave in similar circumstances , and the height , as well as the quantity of matter , will be doubled , so that either the actual or the potential height of the centre of gravity of the fluid seems to be essentially altered , whenever such an interference of waves takes place .
This difficulty deserves the : -atentive consideration of those who shall attempt to investigate either the most refined parts of hydraulics , or the metaphysical principles of the laws of motion .

For , calling this velocity v , the original depth : a , the increased depth x ' , and the velocity of the anterior part of the wave y , w'e have , on the supposition that the extent of the wave:is alregdy become considerable , x =Y a taking the negative or -positive sign according to the direction of the motion of the end since the quantity of fluid , which before occupied a length : expressed by y , now occupies the length yv ad put t av dTti. .

; but the spae , delscribed by the margin of the wave is not exactly z , because ; the e ia in question has moved ' horzontally during its 'acceleratioS , through a space which must be equal to b ; the distance 'a5 tually described will therefore be z+ b , and we have= ' : 2b~ 2by 2 ?

But when v is small , we may takey Tv nearly m ^/ , and z._ ma V. =v ( 2ab ) , and xa+/ ( 2ab ) , while the height of a fluid , in which the 'velocity would be y , is nearly a+3= ( / 2a b ) consequently when the velocity v is at all considerble , y:must be somewhat greater than the velocity of a wave moving on the surface of the elevated fluid ; and probably the sklrface of the elevated portion will not in this case be perfectly hori'e'3wn , but where vi small , y : may be taken , without material error , mrn/ V { , or evyen mV : : , t which is the velocity of every small wave .
The:coefficientf m is iere assumed the same for the motion of a wave , as for the discharge through an aper ; ture , and havereason from observation to think this estimation sufficiently correct .
Supposing:now the moveable end of the canal to remain open at the lower paraar asr as the height c , then the excess of pressure , ocasioned by the elevation before it , and the de : pression behind , will cause the fluid , immediately below the mvoteabieplane.to flow backwards , with the velocity determined by the height , which is the difference between the levels ; and the quantity thus flowing back , together with th Which is ' contained in the moveable elevation , must be equal to the , whole quantity displaced .
But the depression , behind the moveatile body , m'ust vary according to the circumstances o the icaalwhether iti be supposed to end abruptly at the part , from which the motion begins , or to be continued backwards without , limit : in the first case , the elevation z will be to thie depression as v to y v , the length of the same portionofi te fluid being varied i.nversely in that ratio ; in the second case , the proportion will be as y+v toy y v : and z , or second the'difference of the levels will be z+ zx = or second X~ ^7 &gt; * ?

Hence the elevation must always be less than that which is determined by the equation mj/ xc ev , and z is at most equal to %-7 ] = -c b ; but since the velocity of the anterior margin of the wave can never materially exceed ni 2 , especially when z is small , and vi being in this case nearly / + ^v(^a ) b , m V/ =m +i2 a)/ b ) which , multiplied by z , shows the utmost quantity of the fluid that can be supposed to be carried before the obstacle .

In this case , an increase of thediamete does not increase the velocity of the transmission of an impulse ; and when the velocity of the contraction approaches to the natural velocity of an impulse , the quantity of fluid protruded must , if possible , be sill smaller tha ian an open canal ; that is , it must be absolutely inconsiderable , unless the contraction be very great in comparison with the diameter of the pipe , even if its extent " be such as to occasion a friction which may materially impede the retrograde motion of the fluid .
The application of this theory to the motion of the blood in the arteries is very Obvious and I shall enlarge more on the subject when I have the honour of laying before the Society the Croonian Lecture for the present year .
The resistance , opposed to the motion of a floating body , might in some cases be calculated in a similar manner : but the principal part of this resistance appears to be usually derived from a cause which is here neglected ; that is , the force required to produce the ascending , descending , or lateral motions of the particles , which are turned aside to make way for the moving body ; while in this calculation their iredrct and retrograde : motions only are considered .
he -:same mode of considering the motion of a vertical la_:mina may also be employed for determining the velocity of a wave of finite magnitude .
Let the depth of the fluid be a , and suppose the section of the wave to be an isosceles triangle , of which the height is b , and half the breadth c : then the force urging any thin vertical lamina in a horizontal direction will be to its weight as b to c ; and the space d , through which it moves horizontally , while half the wave passes it , will be such that ( c-d ) .
( a +b ) = ac , when ce d= 2 But the final velocity in this space za + b ' is the same as is due to a height equal to the space , reduced in the ratio of the force to the weight , that is , to the height bb f bb which is the 2 ab and half this velocity is xm/ ( b which is the mean velocity of the lamina .
