On the Laws of Low Water at the Port of Plymouth , and on the Permanency of Mean Water .
By the Rev. W. WHEWELL , B.D. F.R.S. , Fellow of Trinity College , Cambridge .
Received April 11 , -Read June 6 , 1839 .
IN former communications to the Society , the laws of high water at Plymouth and other places have been the subject of my researches .
These being obtained , the laws of low water are a subject of importance and interest on many accounts .
The first ground of my pursuing this subject was the desire to ascertain how far the mean water , that is , the height midway between high and low water , is permanent during the changes which high and low water undergo .
That it is approximately so at Plymouth , had been ascertained both by Mr. WALKER and myself , by means of a comparison of a short series of observations .
But it was desirable to know with more exactness what was the real amount of this permanency , when , by using a long series of observations of high and low water , the irregularities arising from accident , and from taking imperfect cycles of inequalities , were eliminated .
There was another reason which made this inquiry important at the present time .
An operation has been recently carried on by the direction and at the expense of the British Association , with a view of ascertaining what surface ought to be taken as the permanent level of the sea .
A Level Line has been carried with great care and accuracy from the north shore of Somlerset to the south shore of Devon ; and the position of this line has been fixed , so as to be recognised at any future time , by means of marks* at Axmouth , at East Quantockshead , at Stolford , and at Portishead .
This line has also been referred to the sea at its extremnities ; and the observations show that the height of mean water coincides , at least very nearly , at different places , as well as at the same place at different times .
While the difference of levels of low water at Axmouth on the English Channel , and Wick Rocks on the Bristol Channel , is not less than twelve feet ; the mean water at those two places coincides in level within a few inches .
In order to determine further what accuracy may be attained in this result , we are led to inquire what is the degree of permanency at one place .
I may further add , that it cannot but be instructive to know how far the corrections of the height and time of low water , for lunar parallax and declination , agree in form and amount with the same corrections already obtained for high water .
I took , therefore , six years of observations at Plymouth ( 1833-1838 ) , made , as I had reason to believe , with care and accuracy under the superintendence of Mr. WALKER , at present the Queen 's Harbour Master at that port : and I had them discussed by Mr. Ross of the Hydrographer 's Office at the Admiralty ; by which gentleman , on this as on former occasions , the requisite calculations have been performed with much zeal and intelligence .
The method employed in discussing the observations was the same , with slight modifications , as in former researches .
The low waters were referred to a transit of the moon anterior by about two days to the time at which each occurred ; and according to the hours of these transits , were divided into twelve horary groups , from 0O1 to 1h , from Ih to 21 , and so on .
In order to find the laws of the heights , the mean height was taken for each of these groups .
The mean parallax for each group was very nearly the absolute mean lunar parallax ; and the mean declination for each group differed from the absolute mean by a small quantity , according to a known law .
Hence the mean heights of the separate horary groups , compared with one another , gave the law of the height as depending upon the hour of transit ; that is , they gave the semimenstrual inequality of height for low water .
1 .
Of the Permanency of the Height of Mean Water .
The height of low water , cleared of the effects of lunar parallax , and very nearly of the effects of lunar declination , and compared with the height of high water similarly cleared , enabled me to ascertain whether the mean water also was affected by a semimenstrual inequality .
The following are the results of this calculation , keeping the six successive years separate .

It appears also that the mean water for each fortnight has a semimenstrual inequality amounting to six or seven inches ; the height of the mean water being greatest 152 when the transit is at 6h , and least when the transit is at 12h .
The immediate cause of this inequality of the mean water is , that the semimenstrual inequality of low water is greater than that of high water ; as I shall soon have further occasion to remark .
How far this small semimenstrual inequality of the height of mean water is universal for all places , I am not at present able to pronounce .
But I am strongly disposed to believe that the difference in the amount of the semnimenstrual inequality of high water and of low water depends upon local circumstances ; and therefore that the semimenstrual inequality of the mean height is a casual and partial result ; the general rule being that the mean height is constant , except so far as it is slightly modified by local circumstances .
2 .
Of the Semimenstrual Inequality of the Height of Low Water at Plymouth .
The height of low water is affected by the moon 's declination , and hence the mean height of low water for a year depends upon the mean declination .
Now the mean declination for the year is different in successive years in consequence of the change of position of the moon 's orbit .
Hence the mean height of low water will be different in successive years .
The same may be said of high water .
The following is the comparison of the successive years now under discussion with reference to this circumstance .

Low water ... .
41 424 3 ; 1 454 2j 47 High water ... ... 16 4 16 3 16 16 2 16 2 16 43 It appears from this , that in the mean low water there is a tolerably regular increase corresponding to the increase of declination , and amounting to about two inches for each degree of declination .
In the high waters , this change is less marked .
When we obtain a declination table from the observations , we find that about the middle part of this table , ( from decl .
12 ?
to 18 ?
) , the correction for declination is about one inch for each degree , which accordingly I shall adopt .
Hence the semimenstrual lines for successive years , obtained by merely taking the mean results of the year , will differ in consequence of the different mean declinations of the moon .
And in order to obtain from them a table suited to the absolute mean of lunar declination , which for such purposes is about 16 ?
, we must correct the result of each year by a proper* quantity ; which quantity may , without sensible error , be supposed the same for all hours of transit , and at Plymouth will amount , as I have said , to about one inch for each degree .
If we suppose the moon to move in the ecliptic , the mean of all her simple declinations will be less than 150 ; but since the declination correction varies as the square of the declination , we must take as the mean declination of the tables , that which gives the mean correction ; which is about 16 ?
, as stated above .
The mean declinations in page 153 are obtained by adding the simple declinations only .
Hence it appears that the year which corresponds most nearly to the mean declination correction is the year 1833 ; and to this , therefore , the others will be reduced .
The semimenstrual inequality for each year will be given at the end of the paper : and for the reasons already stated , I subtract one inch from the heights for 1834 , two inches for 1835 , three inches for 1836 , three inches for 1837 , and four inches for 1838 .
I thus obtain the following results .

In like manner , taking the table of the semimenstrual inequality of high water at Plymouth , I find the mean height to be 16 feet 3inches ; and I express each other height by the excess or defect with reference to this .
In this way I obtain two comparable expressions for the semimenstrual inequality of low and high water as follows : hmhmhmhmhmhmhm Moon 's transit 30 30230 30 30 1 30 73 8 30 90 130 13 330 in .

+16 41254 4 --13 -20-20 --12 3+8 +14 +174Thus it appears that the seminienstrual inequality of low water at Plymouth is greater than that of high water in the ratio of 3 to 2 nearly , the total amounts being respectively 531 inches , and 37 inches .
The total semimenstrual inequality of the mean water is half the difference of those two , or eight inches nearly : but this is to be reduced in consequence of the correction for parallax .
The Parallax Correction of the Height of Low Water at Plymouth .
The parallax correction is obtained from all years alike , by taking the residue of each observation which remains when the semimenstrual inequality is taken away , and arranging these residues ( for each hour of the moon 's transit ) according to the parallax .
The mean declination for each column of such an arrangement is very nearly the absolute mean declination for the year ; and hence the different heights will depend almost entirely upon the different parallaxes .
In this manner we obtain the effect of parallax , arranged according to hours of moon 's transit .
But as the effect upon the height is nearly the same for all hours of transit , I take the mean of all the twelve hours , and thus obtain the parallax correction for the height of low water .
I place along with this the parallax correction for the height of high water at Parallax 5455I2 56I 57L 58i 59 ' 60L 61 I Lowwater. .
+8+6+ 34 + O4 8-13 -15 High water ... 7 41 +1 + 4+71 +10 , the same place .
Hence it appears that at Plymouth the parallax correction for height is somewhat greater for low water than for high water .
In the Appendix , where the parallax corrections for the separate hours are given , it will be seen that although the mean parallax correction for parallax 57 " ' is very small , and may almost be taken as 0 , the parallax correction for the different hours for this value of the parallax , ranges from 44 inches to + 3*7 inches .
This arises from the circumstance that the range of parallax at different hours is not the same , owing to the moon 's variation .
By reason of the sun 's action upon her , her orbit is an oval , the smaller axis of which is in the direction of the sun .
Hence at syzygy she comes so near the earth , that her parallax amounts to 61 ' ; but at quadratures her parallax never exceeds 59 ' } .
Consequently the mean parallax at syzygy is about 58 ' , and at quadrature about 57 ' .
Hence if we take 57 ' for the mean parallax , the semimenstrual curve , obtained as above , is affected by a parallax correction , which is at Oh , and + at 611 transit .
If we take away this correction , so as to obtain the true mean semimenstrual inequality , we find the following .

x2 The Declination Correction of the Height of Low Water at Plymouth .
The declination correction is obtained in a manner analogous to the parallax correction , from each year 's observations .
But the correction thus obtained is that which supposes the mean declination of each year to require no correction .
Now this mean declination in different years is , as we have said , different .
Therefore the declination correction so calculated will be different in different years ; and hence we should require different declination tables in different positions of the moon 's nodes .
But the semimenstrual inequality is also different in different years , in virtue of the difference of the moon 's mean declination .
And when we take from the semimenstrual inequalities that which is requisite to reduce them to the mean declination 16 , ?
, and add it to the declination corrections for each year , the declination corrections for different years coincide very nearly .
For this purpose we add one inch to 1834 , two inches to 1835 , three inches to 1836 , three inches to 1837 , four inches to 1838 , which were subtracted before .
In this way we obtain the following results .
These are the mean declination corrections , no account being taken of the difference of hours , which produces little effect .
I also add the declination corrections as obtained for high water at Plymouth .
By comparison it will appear that the low water corrections are larger , especially for the high declinations .

And I may further observe , that the discussions , of which I have now been stating the results , remove all doubt on the question whether the declination correction , empirically deduced , varies as the square of the declination .
The correction for low water given above , follows that law with great precision , as appears thus .
The above corrections , reduced to 40ths of an inch and to declination 0 , are as follows ; and the squares of the corresponding declinations are expressed in the line below .

POSTSCRIPT .
As a further proof how very nearly constant is the height of mean water , I annex the result of one year 's observations made at Dundee , discussed by Mr. DESSIOU .
It will be seen that the differences are confined within 11 inch , except at 11 and 12 o'clock , when they become about two inches more .
This is in a ( spring ) tide of fourteen feet .
