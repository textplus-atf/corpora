An Introductory Memoir upon Quantics .
By ARTHUR CAYLEY , Esq. Received April 20 , -Read May 4 , 1854 .
i. THE term Quantics is used to denote the entire sublject of rational and integral functions , and of the equations and loci to which these give rise ; the word 'quantic ' is an adjective , meaning of such a degree , but may be used substantively , the noun understood being ( unless the contrary appear by the context ) function ; so used the word admits of the plural 'quantics .
' The quantities or symbols to which the expression 'degree ' refers , or ( what is the same thing ) in regard to which a function is considered as a quantic , will be spoken of as 'facients .
' A quantic may always be considered as being , in regard to its facients , homogeneous , since to render it so , it is only necessary to introduce as a facient unity , or some symbol which is to be ultimately replaced by unity ; and in the cases in which the facients are considered as fortning two or more distinct sets , the quantic may , in like manner , be considered as homogeneous in regard to each set separately .
2 .
The expression 'an equation , ' used without explanation , is to be understood as meaning the equation obtained by putting any quantic equal to zero .
I make no absolute distinction between the words ' degree ' and ' order ' as applied to an equation or system of equations , but I shall in general speak of the order rather than the degree .
The equations of a system may be independent , or there may exist relations of connexion between the different equations of the system ; the subject of a system of equations so connected together is one of extreme complexity and difficulty .
It will be sufficient to notice here , that in any system whatever of equations , assuming only that the equations are not more than sufficient to determine the ratios of the facients , and joining to the system so many linear equations between the facients as will render the ratios of the facients determinate , the order of the system is the same thing as the order of the equation which determines any one of these ratios ; it is clear that for a singleequation the order so determined is nothing else than the order of the equation .
3 .
An equation or system of equations represents , or is represented by a locus .
This assumes that the facients depend upon quantities x , y , ... the coordinates of a point in space ; the entire series of points the coordinates of which satisfy the equation or system of equations , constitutes the locus .
To avoid complexity , it is proper to take the facients themselves as coordinates , or at all events to consider these facients as linear functions of the coordinates ; this being the case , the order of the locus will be the order of the equation or system of equationxs .
have spoken of the coordinates of a point in space .
I consider that there is an ideal space of any number of dimensions , but of course , in the ordinary acceptance of the word , space is of three dimensions ; however , the plane ( the space of ordinary plane geometry ) is a space of two ditensions , and we may consider the line as a space of one dimension .
I do not , it should be observed , say that the only idea which can be formed of a space of two dimensions is the plane , or the only idea which can be formed of space of one dimension is the line ; this is not the case .
To avoid complexity , I will take the case of plane geometry rather than geometry of three dimensions ; it will be unnecessary to speak of space , or of the number of its dimensions or of the plane , since we are only concerned with space of two dimensions , viz. the plane ; I say , therefore , simply that x , y , are the coordinates of a point ( strictly speaking , it is the ratios of these quantities which ale the coordinates , and the quantities x , a , r thenmselves are indeterminate , i. eo they are only determinate to a common factor prss , so that in assuming that the coordinates of a point are c , p , y , we mean only that x:y : z= : P:y , and we never as a result obtain x , y , z=s , p , y but only x : y a:z= : y ; but this being once understood , there is no objection to speaking of x y , z as coordinates ) .
Now the notions of coordinates and of a point are merely relative ; we may , if we please , consider x:y:z as the parameters of a curve containing two variable parameters ; such curve becomes of course determinate when we assume x : , y:z=::y , and this very curve is nothing else than the point whose coordinates are a , 3 , y , or as we may for shortness call it , the point ( ao , 3 , y ) .
And if the coordinates ( x , y , z ) are connected by an equation , then giving to these coordinates the entire system of values which satisfy the equation , the locus of the points corresponding to these values is the locus representing or represented by the equation ; this of course fixes the notion of a curve of any order , and in particular the notion of a line as the curve of the first order .
The theory includes as a very particular case , the ordinary theory of ireciprocity in plane geometry ; we have only to say that the word ' point ' shall mean 'line , ' and the word 'line ' shall mean 'point , ' and that expressions properly or primarily applicable to a point and a line respectively shall be construed to apply to a line and a point respectively , and any t ; heorem ( assumed of course to be a purely descriptive one ) relating to points and lines will become a corresponding theorem Ielating to lines and points ; and similarly with regard to curves of a highler order when the ideas of reciprocity applicable to these curves are properly developed .

A quantic of the degrees m , m'. .
in the sets ( x , y. .
) , ( x ' , y'. .
) &amp;c. will for the most part be represented by a notation such as mm ( *X , Y..x , y'..). .
) , where the marik term multiplied by a coefficient ; these coefficients may be mere numerical multiples of single letters or elements such as a , b , c. .
, or else functions ( in general rational and integral functions ) of such elements ; this explains the meaning of the expression the elements of a quantic ' ; in the case where the coefficients are mere numerical multiples of the elements , we may in general speak indifferently of the elements , or of the coefficients .
I have said that the coefficients may be numerical multiples of single letters or elements such as a , b , c. .
By the appropriate numerical coefficient of a term xy"..x'y'P'. .
, I mean the coefficient of this term in the expansion of m mi ( x+y ... ( f+y'. .
) ) ; and I represent by the notation m mr ( a , b..)Xx , y..x Y ) , a quantic in which each term is multiplied as well by its appropriate numerical coefficient as by the literal coefficient or element which belongs to it in the set ( a , b ... ) of literal coefficients or elements .
On the other hand , I represent by the notation m m ' ( a , 6b**T..x Y3.,. .
) ) , a quantic in which each term is multiplied only by the literal coefficient or element which belongs to it in the set ( a , b ... ) of literal coefficients or elements .
And a like distinction applies to the case where the coefficients are functions of the elements ( a , b , ... ) .
6 .
I consider now the quantic in m~ ( *)jXt , Y. ' , S'..). .
) and selecting any two facients of the same set , e. g. the facients x , y , I remark that there is always an operation upon the elements , tantamount as regards the quantic to the operation xb , ; viz. if we differentiate with respect to each element , multiply by proper functions of the elements and add , we obtain the same result as by differentiating with a and multiplying by x. The simplest example will show this as well as a formal proof ; for instance , as regards 3ax+-bxy+,5cy2 ( the numerical coefficients are taken haphazard ) , we have b6a+10 c tantamount to xra ; as regards a(x--cay)(x-33y ) , we have -a(M+P)a+j a+ ( a+32^ tantamount to xby , and so in any other case .
I represent by { xby } the operation upon the elements tantatnount to xby , and I write down the series of operations { xay)}--a,. .
{ xS 'I ) } y-x',.e where x , y are considered as being successively replaced by every permutation of two different facients of the set ( x , y. .
) ; x ' , y ' as successively replaced by every permautation of two different facients of the set ( x ' , y'. .
) , and so on ; this I call an entire system , and I say that it is made up of partial systems corresponding to the different facient sets respectively ; it is clear from the definition that the quantic is reduced to 247 zero by each of the operations of the entire system .
Now , besides the quantic itself , there are a variety of other functions which are reduced to zero by each of the operations of the entire system ; atny such function is said to be a covariant of the quantic , and in the particular case in which it contains only the elements , an invariant .
( It would be allowable to define as a covariant quoad any set or sets , a function which is reduced to zero by each of the operations of the corresponding partial system or systems , but this is a point upon which it is not at present necessary to dwell .
) 7 .
The definition of a covariant may however be generalized in two directions : we may instead of a single quantic consider two or more quantics ; the operations { x-ay } , although represented by means of the same symbols X , y , have , as regards the different quantics , different meanings , and we may form the sum { wxay } , wherte the summation refers to the different quantics : we have only to consider in place of the system before spoken of , the system l ; { b }-x , ... E { },. .
&amp;c. &amp;c. , and we obtain the definition of a covariant of two or more quantics .
Again , we may consider in connexion with each set of facients any number of new sets , the facients in any one of these new sets corresponding each to each with those of the original set ; and we may admit these new sets into the covariant .
This gives rise to a suiti S(x , ) ) , where the summation refers to the entire series of corresponding sets .
We have in place of the system spoken of in the original definition , to consider the system { Sx }--S( x ; ),. .
{ xa , y}S(x ' , b),. .
&amp;c. &amp;c. , or if we are dealing with two or more quantics , then the system 1{Xa }-3Y S(bY ) , ... .
&amp;c. &amp;c. , and we obtain the generalized definition of a covariant .
8 .
A covariant has been defined simply as a function reduced to zero by each of the operations of the entire system .
Bult in dealing with given quantics , we may without loss of generality consider the covariant as a function of the like form with the quantic , i. e. as being a rational and integral function homogeneous in regard to the different sets separately , and as being also a rational and integral function of the elements .
In particular in the case where the coefficients are mere numerical multiples of the elements , the covariant is to be considered as a rational and integral function holmogeneous in regatd to the different sets separately , and also honlogeneous in regard to the coefficients or elemrents .
And the term 'covariant ' includes , as already remarked , ' invariant .
' It is proper to remark , that if the same quantic be represented by means of different sets of elejenits , then the symbols { x3y } which correspond to these different forms of the same quantic are mere transformations of each other , i. e. they become in virtue of the relations between the different sets of elements identical .
248 What precedes is a return to and generalization of the method employed in the first part of the memoir published in the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal , Old Series , t. iv .
, and New Series , t. i. , under the title " On Linear Transformations , " and CRELLE , t. xxx .
, under the title " M6moire sir les Hyperd6terminants , " and which I shall refer to as my original memoir .
I there consider in fact the invariants of a quantic ( * , , x2 .
y , , Y.ygYm). .
) linear in regard to n sets each of them of m facients , and I represent the coefficients of a term x,.ySt. .
by rst. .
There is no difficulty in seeing that o , ( 3 , being any two different numbers out of the series 1 , 2..m , the operation { x , b } is identical with the operation where the summations refer to s , t. .
which pass respectively from 1 to m , both inclusiye ; and the condition that a function , assumed to be an invariant , i. e. to contain only the coefficients , may be reduced to zero by the operation { xbZa}--Xb , is of course simply the condition that such function may be reduced to zero by the operation { x^ , b } ; the condition in question is therefore the same thing as the equation EN ... ( st. .
dst , ,u of my original memoir .
10 .
But the definition in the present memoir includes also the method made use of in the second part of my original memoir .
This method is substantially as follows : consider for simplicity a quantic UT= containing only the single set ( x , y. .
) , and let Ui , U2. .
be what the quantic becomes when the set ( x , y. .
) is successively replaced by the sets ( Xi , y1. .
) , ( x2 , Y2. .
) , ... the number of these new sets being equal to or greater than the number of facients in the set .
Suppose that A , B , C. .
are any of the determinants al a , a , ... .
yl aX2a 3 then forming the derivative APBqGC ' ... JllUj ... , where p , q , r. .
are any positive integers , the function so obtained is a covariant involving the sets ( x1 , y1. .
) , ( 2 , y2. .
) &amp;c. ; and if after the differentiations we replace these sets by the original set ( x , y. .
) , we have a covariant involving only the original set ( x , y. .
) and of course the coefficients of the quantic .
It is in fact easy to show that any such derivative is a covariant according to the definition given in this Memoir .
But to do this some preliminary explanations are necessary .
11 .
I consider any two operations P , Q , involving each or either of them differentiations in respect of variables contained in the other of them .
It is required to investigate the effect of the operation P.Q , where the operation Q is to be in the first place performed upon some operand Q , and the operation P is then to be performed on the operand Q2 .
Suppose that P involves the differentiations ba , b. .
in respect of variables a , b. .
contained in Q and cl , we must as usual in the operation P replace ba , b,. .
by a b+a ' , ab+'b,. .
where the unaccentuated symbols operate only upon f2 , and the accentuated symbols operate only upon Q. Suppose that P is expanded in ascending poweirs of the symbols a , b. .
, viz. in the form P+P , +P-+ &amp;c. , we have first to find the values of PiQ , P , Q , &amp;c. , by actually performing upon Q as operand the differentiations b ' , b. .
The symbols PQ , P1Q , P2Q , &amp;c. will then contain only the differentiations a5 , a. .
which operate upon Q2 , and the meaning of the expression being once understood , we may write P.Q=PQ+PQ+ P2Q+ &amp;c. In particular if P be a linear function of 'a , a. .
, we have to replace P by P+P , , where P , is the same function of ' , D^. .
that P is of a , b^. .
, and it is therefore clear that we have in this case P.Q=PQ+P(Q ) , where on the right-hand side in the term PQ the differentiations a , b^,. .
are considered as not in anywise affecting the symbol Q , while in the term P(Q ) these differentiations , or what is the same thing , the operation P , is considered to be performed upon Q as operand .
Again , if Q be a linear function of a , b , c. .
, then P , Q=-O , PsQ=O , &amp;c. , and therefore P.Q=IPQ+P , Q ; and I shall in this case also ( and consequently whenever P , Q=0 , P , Q=0 , &amp;c. ) write P.Q=PQ+P(Q ) , where on the right-hand side in the term PQ the differentiations , , B , are considered as not in anywise affecting the symbol Q , while the term P(Q ) is in each case what has been in the first instance represented by P , Q. We have in like manner , if Q be a linear function of a , Ba , ac .
, or if P be a linear function of a , b , c ... Q.P=QP+Q(P ) ; and from the two equations ( since obviously PQ=QP ) we derive P.Q-Q.P=P(Q)Q(P ) , which is the form in which the equations are most fiequently useful .
250 return to the expression APBqC'.-U1U2. .
, and I suppose that after the differentiations the sets ( x , , y9. .
) , ( x2 , Y2. .
) , &amp;c. are replaced by the original set ( x , y. .
) .
To show that the result is a covariant , we must prove that it is reduced to zero by an operation B= { x-ay -xay .
It is easy to see that the change of the sets ( x1 , yi. .
) , ( x2 , Y2. .
) , &amp;c. into the original set ( x , y. .
) may be deferred until after the operation 3 , provided that xab is replaced by xaB1+X2b , +**. .
, or if we please by Sxa , ; we must therefore write B={x}y Sx3g .
Now in the equation A.--B.A-=A(B)--3 ( A ) , where , as before , A(B ) denotes the result of the operation A performed upon B as operand , and similarly f(A ) the result of the operation 2 petformed upon A as operand , we see first that A(3B ) is a determinant two of the lines of which are identical , it is therefore equal to zero ; and next , since 3 does not involve any differentiations affecting A , that O(A ) is also equal to zero .
Hence A.D3--3.A=0 or A and 3B are convertible .
But in like manner B is convertible with B , C , &amp;c. , and consequently I3 is convertible with APBqCr. .
Now ]MU1U2..=O .
Hence @ .
APBqCr..U , U2..= 0 , or APB UCr..UlU2. .
is a covariant , the proposition which was to be proved .
13 .
I pass to a theorem which leads to another method of finding the covariants of a quantic .
For this purpose I consider the quantic m m~ ( *x , y..i , y'xY..). .
) , the coefficients of which are mere numerical multiples of the elements ( a , b , c. .
) ; and in connexion with this quantic I consider the linear functions x+3-y. .
, V'x'+ty ' ... , which treating ( , n. .
) , ( ' , r'. .
) , &amp;c. as coefficients , may be represented in the form ( f , ~..X , y. .
) , ( ' , ~'..x ) ' , Y'. .
) we may from the quantic ( which for convenience I call U ) form an operative quantic mm ( 3t : W , ~..0',..). .
) ( I call this quantic 0 ) , the coefficients of which are mere numerical multiples of a , , ab. .
, the coefficients as all or any of the sets of e. Then { xby } being a linear function of a , b , c. .
the variables to which the differentiations in ( D relate , we have q( .
{ xa } =-={xa } +ID({ x ; b , } ) .
Again , { btd } being a linear function of the differentiations with respect to the variables a , ba,. .
in ( P , we have And these equations serve to show the meaning of the notations ( D({x)y } ) and { 10 } ( q &gt; ) , and there exists between these symbols the singular equation ( { xay})={}( ) .
14 .
The general demonstration of this equation presents no real difficulty , but to avoid the necessity of fixing upon a notation to distinguish the coefficients of the different terms and for the sake of simplicity , I shall merely exhibit by an example the principle of such general demonstration .
Consider the quantic U=ax3+3bx2y + 3cy+ dy3 , this gives= =3a+Fb +Qi.+ c+ 3ad ; or if , for greater clearness , , ) , , , ^ a are represented by / , f , y , , then o=0+ P32 ; 9 + , y.72 + ~41 , and we have { xay}=3ba+2c6b+ ?
d and { 3b } =3a a , + 2b y+y7 , .
Now considering ( 4 as a function of a , ab , b , , or what is the same thing , of a , 3 , y , we may write ( ?
( { ( xa})=c=((3b+2cf3+ die ) ; and if in the expression of ( P we write a+b , a , +b y+ 8+a for o , A , 7 , S ( where only the symbols b ba , b , ,d are to be considered as affecting a , b , c , d as contained in the operand 3bo+2c3-+dr ) , and reject the first term or term independent of a , a^ , ia , bd in the expansion , we have the required value of ( c({vxa } ) .
This value is ( a6 a , b , +(D b-a , +br ~)(3b-+2cP3+ die ) ; or performing the differentiations ba , b , , , a , the value is ( 30G3+2p37+y3X)t i. e. we have D({xy})={rD }( ) .
15 .
Suppose now that ( P is a covariant of ) , then the operation ( P performed upon any covariant of U gives rise to a covariant of the system m m ' ( , Xi tx y. ) , t , y..). .
) , &amp; ( wehv { x}= , &amp;c. .
) , ( Hn , c..eriX ' , y'. .
) , &amp;c. To prove this it is to be in the first instance noticed , that as regal ds ( E , ; ... x , y. .
) , &amp;c. we have { xa , y } =a , &amp;c. Hence considering { xby } , &amp;c. as referring to the quantic U. 252 the operation 1{xby}-xa , will be equivalent to { x &lt; .}+nt-x , , , y and therefore every covariant of the system must be reduced to zero by each of the operations This being the case , we have D. ]D = ( -DM + D(13 ) , equations which it is obvious may be replaced by ( D..M = cDi9+ ( D a Ix ) y ^.-B=B+ , ( { xY } ) , and consequently ( in virtue of the theorem ) by,.3D = &lt; ( DM+{a)}(o ) ; and we have therefore B.@D-(D.3 =-({ B}--a)( ) ) ; or , since ( D is a covariant of ?
, we have B.(D)=).B .
And since every covariant of the system is reduced to zero by the operation B , and therefore by the operation DP.j , such covariant will also be reduced to zero by the operation B.(P , or what is the same thing , the covariant operlated on by ( , is reduced to zero by the operation 21 and is thetefore a covariant , i. e. ( D operating upon a covariant gives a covariant .
16 .
In the case of a quantic such as U= m mn ( *"Xt , 3yx ' , y')- ) , we may instead of the new sets ( a , v ) , ( ' , n'). .
employ the sets ( y , -x ) , ( y ' , -- ' ) , &amp;c. The operative quantic 0 is in this case defined by the equation ?
U=O , and if ( P be , as before , any covariant of 0 , then ( P operating upon a covariant of U will give a covariant of U. The proof is nearly the same as in the preceding case ; we have instead of the equation ( x({xy})={nbt}(( &lt; ) the analogous equation , ( { xa})={x}(@p ) , where on the left-hand side { xby } refers to U , but on the right-hand side { xab , } refers to 0 , and instead of 3={txy}+-7B-- , we have simply i3={xa}--x , .
17 .
I pass next to the quantic ( *x , y)m , which I shall in general consider under the form ( a , b..b ' , a']x , y ) ' , but sometimes under the form ( a , b ... b , a'~x , y)m , the former notation denoting , it will be remembered , axmM+ 6bxm-y. .
+mb\xyn ?
I+a%ym , 11 253 and the latter notation axm + bxy.m- .
+. .
bxym-l + adym But in particular cases the coefficients will be represented all of them by unaccentuated letters , thus ( a , b6 , c , dx , y)3 will be used to denote ax'+3bx2y+3c6xy2+dy ' , and ( a , b , c , a , y)3 w'ill be used to denote ax3+bx2y-+cxy2+dy3 , and so in all similar cases .
Applying the general methods to the quantic ( a , b..b , a'3CXx , y ) " , we see that { yax}-ab^ +2bb ... .+b mb { xd } =mba+ ( m-I cab. .
+a'b , ; in fact , with these meanings of the symbols the quantic is reduced to zero by each of the operations { ya , -y , a { xy } -xay ; hence according to the definition any function which is reduced to zero by each of the last-mentioned operations is a covariant of the quantic .
But in accordance with a preceding remark , the covariant may be considered as a rational and integral function , separately homogeneous in regard to the facients ( x , y ) and the coefficients ( a , b..b ' , a ' ) .
If instead of the single set ( x , y ) the covariant contains the sets ( x1 , y1 ) , ( x2 , y2 ) , &amp;c. , then it must be reduced to zero by each of the operaftions { y{}x-Say , { jx}-Sx } ( where Sya6=y , l1+y , Sy +. .
) , but I shall principally attend to the case in which the covariant contains only the set ( x , y ) .
Suppose , for shortness , that the quantic is represented by U , and let U1 , U2. .
be what U becomes when the set ( x , y ) is successively replaced by the sets ( x1 , yl ) , ( x2 , y2 ) , &amp;c. Suppose moreover that l2=3ly-B-2 by &amp;c. , then the function i 2P13 23r.U .
UU23. .
, in which , after the differentiations , the new sets ( 1 , , yl ) , ( 2 , y2). .
may be replaced by the original set ( x , y)- , will be a covariant of the quantic U. And if the number of differentiations be such as to make the facients disappear , i. e. if the sum of all the indices p , q. .
of the terms 12 , &amp;c. which contain the symbolic nutmber 1 , the sum of all the indices p , r , &amp;c. of the terms which contain the symbolic number 2 , and so on , be severally equal to the degree of the quantic , we have an invariant .
The operative quantic 0 becomes in the case under consideration o=(a , , -ab ... .+_ ?
ax , y ) ) the signs being alternately positive and negative ; in fact it is easy to verify that this expression gives identically OU=O , and any covariant of 0 operating on a covariant of U gives rise to a covariant of U. 18 .
But the quantic ( a , b..b\ , a'cx , y)m , considered as decomposable into linear ' factors , i. e. as expressible in the form 254 gives rise to a fresh series of results .
We have in this case { ya}=aO+a,. .
{ xa } =(ga+F..)aa3+-2aD+2aq+. .
; in fact with these meanings of the symbols the quantic is reduced to zero by each of the operations { xy } -xy , { yb } -yb , and we have consequently the definition of the covariant of a quantic considered as expressed in the form a(x-cey)(x-y). .
And it will be remembered that these and the former values of the symbols { xBy } and { yd3 } are , when the same quantic is considered as represented under the two forms ( a , b,.b ' , a'3x , y)n and a(x-oay)(x-3-y). .
, identical .
19 .
Consider now the expression a ( xyy)j(x-py)k. .
( -. .
) , where the sum of the indicesj , p ... of all the simple factors which contain a , the sum of the indices k , p ... of all the simple factors which contain 3 , &amp;c. are respectively equal to the index 0 of the coefficient a. The index 0 and the indices p , &amp;c. may be considered as arbitrary , nevertheless within such limits as will give positive values ( 0 inclusive ) for the indicesj , k,. .
The expression in question is reduced to zero by each of the operations { xy } -xb , , { yB } -ya3 ; and this is of course also the case with the expressions obtained by interchanging in any manner the roots a , 3 , y. .
, and therefore with the expression elz(x --.y)i(-p **o3 .
) ) where E denotes a summation with respect to all the different permutations of the roots a , 3 ... The function so obtained ( which is of course a rational function of a , b..b ' , a ' ) will be a covariant , and if we suppose p=m6-2Sp , where Sp denotes the sum of all the indices p of the different terms ( a--3)P , &amp;c. , then the covariant will be of the order p ( i. e. of the degree c in the facients x , y ) , and of the degree 0 in the coefficients .
20 .
In connexion with this covariant a ?
( x --y ay)p ( x.y)k .

) of the order / and of the degree 0 in the coefficients , of the quantic U= a(x--Vy ) ( xy). .
, consider the covariant Y( 12P..)V , V,. .
Um of a quantic V= ( *3Xx , Y ) " in which , after the differentiations , the sets ( x1 , y ) , ( x2 , y2). .
are replaced by the original set ( x , y ) .
The last-mentioned covariant will be of the order m(p--0)+P , and will be of the degree m in the coefficients ; and in particular if tp=d , i. e. if V be a quantic of the order 0 , then the covariant will be of the order ^ and of the degree 255 m in the coefficients .
Hence to a covariant of the degree 0 in the coefficients , of a quantic of the order m , there corresponds a covariant of the degree m in the coefficients , of a quantic of the order 4 ; the two covariants in question being each of them of the same order p. And it is proper to notice , that if we had commenced with the covariant of the quantic V , a reverse process would have led to the covariant of the quantic U. We may , therefore , say that the covariants of a given order and of the degree d in the coefficients , of a quantic of the order m , correspond each to each with the covariants of the same order and of the degree m in the coefficients , of a quantic of the order 4 ; and in particular the invariants of the degree 4 of a quantic of the order m , correspond each to each with the invariants of the degree m of a quantic of the order J. This is the law of reciprocity demonstrated by M. HERMIT , by a method which ( I amu inclined to think ) is substantially identical with that here made use of , although presented in a very different form : the discovery of the law , consider7ed as a law relating to the number of invariants , is due to Mr. SYLVESTER .
The precise meaning of the law , in the last-mentioned point of view , requires some explanation .
Suppose that we know all the really independent invariants of a quantic of the order m , the law gives the n be of nvaiants of the degtee m of vari ants of a the order 4 ( it is convenient to assune &gt; m ) , viz. of the invariants of the degree in question , which are linearly independent , or asyzygetic , i. e. such that there do not exist any merely numerical multiples of these invariants having the sum zero , but the invariants in question may and in general will be connected inter se and with the other invariants of the quantic to which they belong by non-linear equations ; and in particular the system of invariants of the degree m will comprise all the invariants of that degree ( if any ) which are rational and integral functions of the invariants of lower degrees .
The like observations apply to the system of covariants of a given order and of the degree m in the coefficients , of a quantic of the order 4 .
21 .
The number of the really independent covariants of a quantic ( *ax , y)m is precisely equal to the order m of the quantic , i. e. any covariant is a function ( generally an irtational function only expressible as the root of an equation ) of any m independent covariants , and in like manner the number of really independent invariants is m-2 ; we may , if we please , take m--2 really independent invariants as part of the system of the m independent covariants ; the quantic itself may be taken as one of the other two covatiants , and any other covariant as the other of the two covariants ; we may therefore say that every covariant is a function ( generally an irrational function only expressible as the root of an equation ) of m-2 invariants , of the quantic itself and of a given covariant .
22 .
Consider any covariant of the quantic ( a , b. .
b ' a ' ; x3 , y ) , and let this be of the order ^ , and of the degree 4 in the coefficients .
It is very easily shown that md-p is necessarily even .
In particular in the case of an invariant 256 ( i. e. when ( ^=O ) md is necessarily even* ; so that a quantic of an odd order admits only of invariants of an even degree .
But there is an important distinction between the cases of mO-p , evenly even and oddly even .
In the former case the covariant remains unaltered by the substitution of ( y , x ) , ( a ' , b',. .
b , a ) for ( x , y ) , ( a , b,. .
b , a ' ) ; in the latter case the effect of the substitution is to change the sign of the covariant .
The covariant may in the former case be called a symmetric covariant , and in the latter case a skew covariant .
It may be noticed in passing , that the simplest skew invariant is M. HERMITE'S invariant of the 18th degree of a quantic of the 5th order .
23 .
There is another very simple condition which is satisfied by every covariant of the quantic ( a , b..b ' , a ' , y)m , viz. if we consider the facients ( x , y ) as being respectively of the weights 27 , - , and the coefficients ( a , b..b ' , a ' ) as being respectively of the weights -n , m+-fl,..2m1 , n2 m , then the weight of each term of the covariant will be zero .
This is the most elegant statement of the law , but to avoid negative quantities , the statement may be modified as follows:-if the facients ( x , y ) are considered as being of the weights 1 , 0 respectively , and the coefficients ( a , b. .
' , a ' ) as being of the weights 0 , 1. .
m-l , m respectively , then the weight of each term of the covariant will be 2 ( mO-9 ) .
24 .
The preceding laws as to the form of a covariant have been stated here by way of anticipation , principally for the sake of the remark , that they so far define the form of a covariant as to render it in very many cases practicable with a moderate amount of labour to complete the investigations by means of the operations { xby } --xy and { y3 } -y3 .
In fact , for finding the covariants of a given order , and of a given degree in the coefficients , we may form the most general function of the proper order and degree in the coefficients , satisfying the prescribed conditions as to symmetry and weight : such function , if reduced to zero by one of the operations in question , will , on account of the symmetry , be reduced to zero by the other of the operations in question ; it is therefore only necessary to effect upon it , e.g. the operation { ( x } xy , and to determine if possible the indeterminate coefficients in such manner as to render the result identically zero : of course when this cannot be done there is not any covariant of the form in question .
It is moreover proper to remark , as regards invariants , that if an invariant be expanded in a series of ascending powers of the first coefficient a , and the first term of the expansion is known , all the remaining terms can be at once deduced by mere differentiations .
There is one very important case in which the value of such first term ( i. e. the value of the invariant when a is put equal to 0 ) can be deduced from the corresponding invariant of a quantic of the next inferior order ; the case in question is that of the discriminant ( or function which equated to zero expresses the equality of a pair of roots ) ; for by JOACHIMSTHAL'S theorem , if in the discritninant of the quantic ( a , b..b ' , a'x , y ) we write a=O , the result contains b2 as a factor , and divested of this factor is precisely the discriminant of the quantic of the order m-l obtained from the given quantic by writing a=O and throwing out the factor x : this is in practice a very convenient method for the calculation of the discriminants of quantics of successive orders .
It is also to be noticed as regaids covariants , that when the first or last coefficient of any covariant ( i. e. the coefficient of the highest power of either of the facients ) is known , all the other coefficients can be deduced by mere differentiations .
POSTSCRIPT added October 7th , 1854.-I have , since the preceding memoir was written , found with respect to the covariants of a quantic ( *xt , y)f " , that a function of any order and degree in the coefficients satisfying the necessary condition as to weight , and such that it is reduced to zero by one of the operations { xa'y}-xa , { yb}-yb , , will of necessity be reduced to zero by the other of the two operations , i. e. it will be a covariant ; and I have been thereby led to the discovery of the law for the number of asyzygetic covariants of a given order and degree in the coefficients ; from this law I deduce as a corollary , the law of reciprocity of MM .
SYLVESTER and HERMIT .
I hope to return to the subject in a subsequent memoir .
