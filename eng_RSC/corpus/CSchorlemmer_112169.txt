Action of Sodium and Amyl Iodide upon Acetic Ether .
For this reaction the compounds of sodium derived from acetic ether were prepared as before , and were then submitted to the action of amylic iodide for several hours at the boiling-point of the mixture .
When the sodium had all become converted into iodide , water was added and the supernatant liquid decanted .
We reserve a complete description of this liquid for our next communication , and will here confine ourselves to the separation from it of cenanthylic acid , which was obtained as follows:-The crude product , after drying over chloride of calcium , was submitted to rectification , and the portion boiling between 170 ?
and 190 ?
C. collected apart and decomposed by ebullition with alcoholic potash .
By this treatment we destroyed any ethylic amylacetone carbonate and ethylic diamylacetone carbonate that were present , and obtained a potash-salt of an acid derived from acetic acid by the substitution of one atom of amyl for one of hydrogen .
The potash-salt thus obtained was distilled with excess of sulphuric acid diluted with a large quantity of water .
Upon the distillate there floated an oily acid , possessing an odour resembling cenanthylic acid .
This acid was converted into an ammonia-salt , from which a silver-salt was prepared by precipitation .
After being well washed with cold water , this salt yielded numbers on analysis closely corresponding with the formula of amylacetate or cenanthylate of silver : C H0 O Ag We have also examined the barium-salt , which is an amorphous soapy substance .
Dried at 100 ?
C. , *2715 grm. gave '1599 grm. of barium sulphate , corresponding to 34'62 per cent. of barium .
Barium cenanthylate contains 34'69 per cent. of barium .
We believe amylacetic acid to be identical with cenanthylic acid .
The concluding portion of the paper is devoted to a discussion of the theoretical bearings of the reactions above described , and to the investigation of the internal architecture of the synthetically prepared ethers , acids , and ketones .

Communicated by Prof. H. E. RoscoE .
Received July 20 , 1865 .
From my experiments communicated to the Royal Society on the 6th of April , 1865 , I concluded that the question , whether only one series of hydrocarbons of the general formula C , , I-T , ,+2 exists , or whether this [ Nov. 16 , 464 series exhibits cases of absolute isomerism , can only be definitely decided by obtaining from different sources perfectly pure hydrocarbons , having the same composition .
But unfortunately only a few of the hydrocarbons can be obtained perfectly pure , and still fewer of these possessing the same composition can be derived from different sources .
This is seen by a glance at the following Table , containing those alcohol-radicals and hydrides which have been obtained with certainty in a pure state .

202 For the purpose of examining the question of the identity or the isomerism of these hydrocarbons , I selected methyl-hexyl and hydride of heptyl , obtained from azelaic acid , comparing the properties of these bodies with ethyl-amyl , as described in my last communication .
( 1 ) Methyl-hexyl .
Methyl-hexyl ( methyl-caproyl ) has already been prepared by Wurtz by the electrolysis of a mixture of acetate and cenanthylate of potassium , but he has obtained it in a small quantity only , and in a very impure state .
I adopted the same method , and am able to confirm all that Wurtz has stated .
Although I employed several ounces of cenanthylate of potassium , only a very inconsiderable quantity of an aromatic oil was obtained , which , in order to isolate the hydrocarbon C7 H , , , was first distilled with concentrated sulphuric acid , by the action of which sulphurous acid was evolved and a black charry matter separated out .
The oily distillate was well washed and further purified by means of nitric acid , caustic potash , and sodium , as described in my former papers , and then the small quantity of methyl-hexyl separated by fractional distillation from hcxyl , C,1 H26 , which latter hydrocarbon is formed in by far the greatest proportion .
Methyl-hexyl boils at 89 ?

16 16'14 100 99'9 The quantity which I obtained was only sufficient for determining the boiling-point and the specific gravity , both of which nearly coincide with those of ethyl-amyl ; and although I could not investigate its reactions , I believe that these also will agree with those of ethyl-amyl , so that the two hydrocarbons appear to be identical .
( 2 ) Hydride of Heptyl from Azelaitc Acid .
By C. SCHORLEMMER and R. S. DALE , B.A. One of us has shown that by heating a mixture of azelaic acid and caustic baryta to a dull red heat , an aromatic liquid is obtained , which chiefly consists of the hydrocarbon C7 IH .
By oxidizing castor-oil with nitric acid on a large scale , one pound of pure azelaic acid was prepared , which yielded about one ounce of a hydrocarbon boiling between 95 ?
and 100 ? .
Subjected to fractional distillation , a small quantity of hydride of hexyl from the suberic acid , which still adhered to the azelaic acid , was separated , and now the liquid boiled constantly at 100 ?

This decomposition goes on much quicker than in the case of the chloride from ethylamiyl ; and the proportions of the substances formed also differ , as only a very small quantity of heptylene is produced , and the chief product consists of the acetate , whilst the chlorides from ethyl-amyl and from petroleum yield these two substances in about equal quantities .
The heptylene boils at 95 ?

The faint garlic-like smell is identical with that of the heptylene described in my last paper .

Its odour cannot be distinguished from that of the alcohol from ethylamyl .
By oxidizing it with chromic acid , first the odour of oenanthol is perceived , and then an oily acid is obtained , which by its smell , as well as the analysis of its silver-salt , was recognized as cenanthylic acid .
0*1205 of the silver-salt obtained by saturating the rectified acid distillate with carbonate of silver , gave 0-0551 of metallic silver , or 45 72 per cent. , the formula C , H13 Ag 0 , requiring 45-57 per cent. Ag .
The annexed Table gives the boiling-points and specific gravities of the hydrocarbons C , H16 of different origin , and their derivatives .
From these data , as well as from the experiments detailed in this and in my former papers , it appears that we meet here with examples of absolute isomerism , viz. compounds having the same percentage composition and the same constitutional formula ( A. Crum Brown ) , but differing from each other in their physical properties .
This is not only the case with the hydrocarbons , but also , in a greater or less degree , with their derivatives .
Ethyl-amyl and hydride of heptyl from azelaic acid , as well as the corresponding chlorides , were obtained in as pure a state as possible , and in pretty large quantities ; and although only small quantities of the acetate , alcohol , and olefine from the hydride were at our disposition , yet the greatest care was taken to obtain them pure , and all determination of the boiling-points and specific gravities were carried out under the same circumstances , the same thermometer always being used , so that they may be fairly compared with each other .

C. M. Warren has lately published * an investigation on the hydrocarbons contained in the American petroleum , which he isolated according to a new method of fractional condensation .
He states that the petroleum contains two series of the hydrocarbons C H2,1+2 , the isomeric pairs of which show a difference in their boiling-points of 7 ?
-8 ? .
Some of the results which I have formerly obtained tend to confirm this view .
Frankland , Wurtz , Pelouze , and Cahours found 30 ?
as the boiling-point of hydride of amyl ; the hydrocarbons of the same composition , which I isolated from the light oils obtained from Cannel coal , boils constantly between 39 ?
and 40 ? .
The hydride of heptyl obtained from the same source boiled at 98 ?
-99 ?
, and the same hydrocarbon I found in American petroleum , whilst Pelouze and Cahours give 92 ?
-94 ?
as the boiling-point ; and in my last communication I have quoted some experiments made by Mr. Wright , who found that from that part of American petroleum which boils between 95 ?
-100 ?
a considerable quantity of a hydrocarbon , C7 H6 ) , may be obtained which boils constantly at 90 ?
-92 ? .
These latter hydrocarbons and their derivatives show , even after repeated rectification , higher specific gravities than the isomeric alcohol-radicals and the hydrocarbons from azelaic acid .
Thus it appears that bodies showing a purely physical isomerism are as numerous in the marsh-gas family as in the case of the terpines , C1 , H1 .
In order to complete this investigation , I intended to study in the same manner the hydrocarbons C , H4 , , namely hydride of hexyl from suberic acid , methyl-amyl , and , if possible , ethyl-butyl ; but this intention could not be carried out , as I could not succeed in preparing methyl-amyl .
This hydrocarbon appears not to be formed by any of the methods which are employed to prepare the so-called mixed alcohol-radicals .
A mixture of the iodides of methyl and amyl is exceedingly slowly attacked by sodium .
The boiling-point of the mixture is below the fusing-point of sodium , and the metal soon becomes coated with a hard crust of iodide of sodium .
added , therefore , a sufficient quantity of pure amyl to raise the boiling point , but even the sodium in the fused state acts very slowly , a considerable quantity of gaseous products being evolved .
After the mixture had been heated for a week , large quantities of the iodides were still present , and after destroying these by strong nitric acid , the remaining hydrocarbon was found to be pure amyl .
No better results were obtained by adding anhydrous ether to the mixture .
The action in the cold is exceedingly slow ; heated in sealed tubes , the iodides are soon decomposed ; but besides gaseous prodlcts , only amyl , and not a trace of a mixed radical , is formed .
Besides hydride of heptyl , other products are formed by the action of caustic baryta upon azelaic acid .
Of those only one could be obtained in a pure state .
If the aromatic liquid which is first obtained is distilled with water , hydride of heptyl chiefly distils , and a brown oily liquid remains behind , which , after cooling , solidifies to a crystalline mass containing a brown aromatic oil which may be removed from the crystagls by pressing between blotting-paper .
The solid substance is repeatedly recrystallized from hot diluted alcohol , in which the still adhering oil is very slightly soluble .
The pure substance is thus obtained in small colourless needles , which are grouped in tufts .
It is odourless and tasteless , very soluble in ether and in alcohol , insoluble in water , melts between 41 ?
and 42 ?
, solidifies again at 40 ?
, and distils between 283o--285 ?
( not corrected ) without decomposition .
The following analysis shows that it has the formula Cn H22 .

857 85-77 , ... ... ... ... 143 14-40 100.0 100i 17 The quantity obtained was not sufficient to determine the vapour-density .
If this olefine is suspended in water and bromine added , not in excess , the two substances combine readily to a colourless oily liquid , the odour of which resembles bibromide of ethylene .
It cannot be distilled without decomposition , and appears even to be decomposed by a diluted solution of caustic soda , as a small portion thus treated in order to remove an excess of bromine changed its odour completely .
By an unfortunate accident the whole of the bromide was lost , with the exception of the portion treated with caustic soda .
This was washed with water , dissolved in ether , and the ethereal solution dried with chloride of calcium .
After evaporating the ether and drying the remaining small quantity of heavy yellow oil over sulphuric acid under the air-pump , only just sufficient was left to determine the bromine .
0-1500 gave 0-0736 of bromide of silver , and 0-0102 of metallic silver , corresponding to 25-8 per cent. of bromine .
From the boiling point of the olefine it appears that its molecular formula is most likely C6 , ,-32 ; and if bromine forms the bibromide , C , , H32 Br , , from which by the action of caustic soda H Br is abstracted , the compound analyzed would be C , , H , Br , which formula requires 26-4 per cent. of bromine , whilst the analysis gave 25'8 per cent. ; the hydrocarbon would then be an isomer of cetene .
