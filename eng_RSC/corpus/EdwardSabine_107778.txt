By Captain EDWARD SABINE , of the Royal Artillery , Secretary of the Royal Society .
Communicated by Dr. THOMAS YOUNG , Secretary of the late Board of Longitude .
Read March 12 and 19 , 1829 .
THE 128th number of Professor SCHUMACHER'S Astronomische Nachrichten , published in January 1828 , contained an announcement from M. BESSEL , that he had found the theory incorrect , according to which it has been customary to reduce the vibrations of a pendulum in air , to the corresponding vibrations in a vacuum : the incorrectness consisting principally , in no provision having been made in the theory , for the expenditure of a part of the moving force , on the particles of the air set in motion by the pendulum in its vibration .
On the arrival in London of the number of the Astronomische Nachrichten containing this announcement , a proposal was made to the late Board of Longitude , to submit the question , of the reduction of the vibrations to a vacuum , to the test of the most direct experiment ; by the construction of an apparatus , in which a pendulum might be alternately vibrated in air of full atmospheric pressure , and in rarefied air approaching nearly to a vacuum .
The expense of the proposed apparatus was estimated at 251 .
; which sum the Board of Longitude , at the recommendation of the President of the Royal Society , and of Dr. YOUNG Secretary of the Board , was pleased to allot for that purpose .
Mr. NEWMAN , who was employed to malie the apparatus , gave great attention towards accomplishing it in the best manner ; and to his care in respect to expense it is owing , that the cost has but very little exceeded the estimate .
How well it has answered its intended purpose will be best collected from the experiments themselves .
The apparatus is represented in Plate VI , which may be referred to for the particular dimensions .
It consists , generally , of six pieces , exclusive of the iron frame by which the suspension is fixed securely to the wall of the apartnlent .
The pedestal is of cast iron 2 inches thick , being a cylinder of one foot in height and a foot interior diameter , open at the top , and closed at the bottom by an horizontal plate 3 feet long by 16 inches broad , resting on four screws , by which it can be raised , depressed , and levelled .
A metallic pipe communicating with an air-pump is fitted to a hole perforated at half the height of the cylinder .
The metallic pipe is furnished with a stop-cock , by which the communication between the pump and the interior of the cylinder can be closed at pleasure .
The three next pieces in succession above the pedestal are glass cylinders slightly conical , having their rims ground into surfaces fitting one to another .
The suspension piece , which is the next above the three glasses , is a metal plate , having holes to receive the screws of the bed containing the agate planes , and to admit the pendulum to its place : it is surrounded by a circular metal ring , the outside of which forms a part of the exterior of the apparatus , and the upper and lower surfaces are ground , so as to form close joints with the glass cylinder beneath , and with a bell glass , which is the 6th piece , completing the upper part of the apparatus .
The ring surrounding the suspension plate is perforated to admit a screw , which passes through a stuffing-box , and acts on an inclined plane beneath the Y 's , serving to raise the pendulum on the Y 's , and to lower it on the planes .
The pedestal cylinder is also perforated , to admit a wire with a cross-piece at the extremity , for the purpose of stopping , or of giving fresh impulse to , the pendulum .
This wire also passes through a stuffing-box .
To set up the apparatus , the pedestal is placed as nearly as can be judged in the situation it will occupy when the suspension piece is secured to the wall .
A graduated arc is then fixed , by a wooden frame fitted to the interior of the cylinder , so that the arc may be seen from the coincidence telescope about 2 inches above the iron cylinder .
The three glasses are then placed in succession resting on one another , and the lower one resting on the ground surface of the rim of the iron cylinder , the joints being made secure by pomatum .
The foot screws of the pedestal are then adjusted , until the upper glass is brought exactly into its proper position , in regard to the iron frame by which the apparatus is ultimately to be secured to the wall .
The suspension piece is then placed on the upper glass , on which it rests with its entire weight , ensuring thereby the contact of the surfaces of glass and metal .
The suspension piece being surmounted by the bell glass , the air is withdrawn , and the weight of the atmosphere on the exterior presses the several joints into the closest contact .
Before the air is re-admitted , four screws , destined to connect the iron frame in whvlich they work with the suspension piece , are turned until their pressure in different directions , against the outside of the ring surrounding the suspension plate , attaches it firmly to the iron fiame .
The frame is itself very firmly screwed to stone piers deeply imbedded in the wall on either side , and is further strengthened by brackets , fixed in the direction which is most immediately opposed to any motion of vibration , which might be communicated by the pendulum .
The air is then re-admitted , the bell glass taken off , the agate planes screwed on and levelled , the pendulum suspended , with such thermometers , barometer , and gauge as may be required , and the bell glass replaced .
All beneath the bell glass remains from thenceforward a fixture , the air being withdrawn and admitted at pleasure through the metallic pipe governed by the stop-cock .
As the three middle glasses are pressed tightly between the suspension piece and the pedestal , neither of which can give way to their expansion , it might not be prudent perhaps to risk their fiacture , by leaving them so screwed , for such a length of time as should involve a great change of temperature .
To avoid this , it is only necessary to loosen the screws which connect the iron frame with the suspension piece , to tighten them again at a new temperature , and to re-level the planes .
This description applies to the apparatus as it is now established in the southwest angle of the quadrant-room at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich : an angle being chosen , because the stone piers , to which the iron frame is screwed , have in such case but a small distance to project from the walls , in order to form an appui on both sides .
The apparatus was employed in the two first experimeents at Mr. BROWNE'S house in London , where similar means could not be resorted to for rendering the point of suspension of the pendulum immovable .
In these experiments the agate planes were screwed to an iron plate , which was supported by four iron bars springing from the interior of the cylinder of the pedestal ; and the bell glass rested on the upper glass cylinder , without the intervention of the suspension piece .
It will be seen by the result of those two experiments , compared with the result of others in which the point of suspension was immovable , that the small motion of the support of the pendulum , occasioned by the elasticity of the iron bars , did not prejudice the comparative result of the vibration in air of different density : so that in all cases where a relative result only is required , the apparatus is effective , without the means resorted to at Greenwich to make the suspension immovable .
Through the liberality of the Managers of the Royal Institution , the use of the air-pump belonging to the Institution was obtained for these experiments : and also an apparatus for the formation and supply of hydrogen gas , for purposes which will be described in their due succession .
The experiments will be related in the order in which they were made , as being perhaps the most simple and perspicuous mode .
June 28 , 1828.-On this day Mr. NEWMAN having brought all the parts of the apparatus intended for the vacuum experiments to Portland Place , it was established in front of Mr. BROWNE 's clock by MOLYNEUX .
The invariable pendulum No. 12 .
was placed on the agate planes numbered also 12 , which were screwed fast to the iron plate supported by the four iron bars , and were carefully levelled .
he thermometer , graduated by Mr. DANIELL and myself , used in my former pendulum experiments , was suspended withinside the glasses , so that the ball was midway between the axis and the lower part of the weight of the pendulum ; a mercurial gauge , commencing to act when the pressure was reduced to 10 inches , was also suspended .
The pendulum was 1 foot 6 inches in front of the pendulum of the clock ; and the telescope for observing coincidences was stationed in an adjoining room , 18 feet 6 inches from the detached pendulum , and 20 feet from the pendulum of the clock .
A detached diaphragm , having a vertical opening , the sides of which viewed from the telescope were tangents to the disk , was placed between the vacuum apparatus and the disk- ; so that when the glasses were on , the disk and diaphragm were both seen from the telescope through the back and front of the lower glass cylinder .
A graduated arc was placed with the diaphragm : the distance from the axis to the part of the pendulum crossed by the arc as seen from the telescope was 49.5 inches : the are was divided into degrees , and the degrees were subdivided into spaces of 10 ' each : the length of a degree was 0.73 inch : consequently the arc read off required to be multiplied by.845 to produce 210 the true arc of vibration .
The telescope was then adjusted for the observation of coincidences , the glasses of the apparatus being on , and the joints pomatumed .
A preliminary trial was then made of the facility with which the air could be withdrawn .
A double pump kept in steady action for fifteen minutes reduced the pressure to 7 inches .
More was not then attempted ; but on stopping the action-of the pump , it was soon observed that a leak must exist , as the gauge rose at the rate of about an inch in seven or eight minutes .
On intercepting the communication between the pump and the apparatus , the leak was shown to be in the latter .
The air was then re-admitted ; the joints examined , as well as the stuffing-box through which the wire passed which was employed to set the pendulum in motion .
Mr. NEWMAN expressed himself satisfied that the leak could be only in the metal of the iron cylinder , notwithstanding the thickness of the metal was two inches .
The further examination of the leak was postponed ; and the pendulum prepared for the next day , when it was proposed to try its comparative vibration in air , and in a mediuan as rarefied as could be maintained in the then imperfect state of the apparatus .

0 85937.54 The barometer used in these and the subsequent experiments in London belonged to Mr. BROWNE .
By several comparisons with the standard baro2 2 211 meters of the Royal Society and of the Royal Observatory , made by means of an intermediate portable barometer , an index correction of +0.066 was found to be required , to make Mr. BROWNE'S barometer agree with the standards when corrected for capillary action .
This correction is accordingly applied .
In these and in all the subsequent experiments , both in London and at Greenwich , the registered arcs were obtained in the following manner:-The points of the graduated arc were noted , opposite to which the same side of the tailpiece of the pendulum stopped when at each extremity of its vibration ; this gave the whole arc passed through by the pendulum without reference to a zero point : the half of this is the semi-arc of vibration .
The same process was then gone through with the other side of the tail-piece of the pendulum ; and a mean of the two semi-arcs is the arc registered .
The true arc is the registered arc multiplied by.845 .
The preliminary experiment in air being concluded , the pendulum was stopped by the wire passing through the stuffing-box , and again set in motion by the same at a true arc exceeding 1§ 47 ' , being the arc with which the preceding experiment in air had commenced .
The air was then withdrawn until the pressure was reduced to 7 inches .
The thermometer , which had stood at 71 ?
.4 before the process of withdrawing the air commenced , was observed to fall gradually , until it was reduced to 70 ?
.7 , when the pressure was 7 inches , The interval between successive coincidences being about six minutes , and the leak admitting sufficient air to cause the gauge to rise an inch in six minutes , whilst by working the pump gently , two inches could with ease be gained in the same time , the pump was worked , during the first 12 coincidences , only in the alternate intervals .
From the 12th to the 39th coincidence , the gauge was kept always as near 7 inches as could be appreciated , by a very gentle and continued exercise of the pump .

85937.40 The glasses were then removed , and the pendulum raised on the Y 's ; in which operation it was observed that it had not quitted its place during the experiments , in which it had been twice set in motion and twice stopped by the wire which passes through the stuffing-box .
The pendulum was then removed , and the horizontality of the planes examined and found perfectly correct .
The vibrations in air , before and after those in the rarefied medium , were as follows : In the morning , before the vibration in 85937.54 ; Barom. 29.861 the rarefied medium ... .
In the evening , after the vibration in 85937.40 ; Barom. 29.829 the rarefied medium .
Mean. .
85937.47 ; Barom. 29.845 The vibrations in the rarefied medium , re5944 Gauge 7.08 duced to the same temp. as those in air .
85944.85 ; _ Whence there appears , as the result of this experiment , a difference of 7.38 vibrations per diem , corresponding to a difference of atmospheric pressure of 22.765 inches : the temperature of the air of full pressure being 72 ?
.01 ; and that of the rarefied air 72 ?
.5 .
The indications of the thermometer in the rarefied medium have been increased O ?
.7 , to compensate the effect produced on the thermometer by the removal of the full pressure of the atmosphere .
It has been noticed , that on the pump being worked , the thermometer , which previously stood at 71 ?
.4 , fell to 70 ?
.7 , which it indicated when the pressure was reduced to 7 inches .
The converse took place when the air was re-admitted .
To ascertain whether this effect was rightly ascribed to the removal of the pressure of the atmosphere on the exterior of the ball and tube of the thermometer , the following experiment 214 was made:-The thermometer being immersed in pounded ice , and placed on the brass plate of an air-pump , the mercury coincided exactly with the division of 32 ?
: it was then covered with a receiver , and the air withdrawn : the thermometer fell as the pump was worked ; and when the gauge indicated a pressure of half an inch , the mercury stood at 310.25 : on re-admitting the air it rose again to 32 ? .
The experiment was repeated with precisely similar results .
By observing carefully the indications of the thermometer with those of the gauge , the following corrections of the thermometer were assigned for different pressures : for a near approach to a vacuum + 0 ?
.75 ; for 7 inches and thereabouts + 0 ?
.70 ; for 15 inches and thereabouts + 0.5 ; and for 20 inches + 0 ?
.4 .
The propriety of these corrections was subsequently confirmed , in the experiments with the vacuum apparatus at Greenwich which will be related in the sequel , by registering always the comparative indications of the thermometer which had been tried in ice , and of two others included in a glass cylinder , which had been hermetically closed under the receiver of an air-purnp when the air was withdrawn .
The cylinder including these thermometers being suspended by the side of the standard in the vacuum apparatus , the doubly enclosed thermometers underwent no change on the exhaustion of the apparatus whilst the standard thermometer fell an amount corresponding to the above corrections , and remained permanently lower than the others to the same amount , until the air was re-admitted , when the indications of the three agreed* .
The result of the experiment on the 29th of June then was , a difference of 7.38 vibrations for a difference of pressure of atmospheric air at 72 , corresponding to 22.765 inches of mercury at 32 ?
: this result is equivalent to the reduction to a vacuum , for the vibration in a pressure of 30 inches of air of 72 ?
, of 9.725 vibrations per diem .
The specific gravity of the pendulum being about 8.6 ; and the weight of water to that of air , at 29.27 inches of the barometer , and 53 ?
of the thermometer , as 836 to 1 , and the expansion of air for each degree of the thermometer n-dth of its bulk , the correction for the buoyancy of an atmosphere of 30 inches of air at 720 , is 5.88 vibrations .
The difference , or 3.845 vibrations per diem , is the amount by which the experimental reduction to a vacuum exceeds the reduction which it has been customary to compute .
From the imperfect state of the apparatus in this first experiment , doubts might have been entertained of the correctness of the result on two accounts : it might have been supposed , 1st , that the abstraction of the air being kept up continually , during the vibration in the rarefied medium , to counteract the leakage , currents might have been occasioned influencing the time of vibration : or , 2nd , the iron bars supporting the pendulum not having sufficient spread at the bottom to counteract the lateral force arising from the vibration , and the point of suspension itself partaking of it in consequence , it might have been supposed that the time of vibration was unequally affected thereby in the air and in the rarefied medium .
By experiments made with the same pendulum on the 8th and 9th of July , an account of which is already before the Society , ( Phil. Trans. 1829 , Art .
IX .
) in which experiments the pendulum was suspended from Captain KATER'S original mahogany support in the same room , the vibrations on an immovable support , all other circumstances being the same , were found to exceed those on the plate of the vacuum apparatus , by about 18 vibrations a day ; due , doubtless , to the motion of the plate during the vibration , arising from the elasticity of the iron bars and their insufficient spread .
To give more firmness to the suspension in the vacuum apparatus in a second experiment , inch boards of well seasoned oak were inserted vertically , having their lower ends resting on the interior of the iron cylinder which supports the glasses , and the plate was screwed down firmly on their upper ends by screws workling into the iron bars : the suspension plate was thus directly and firmly connected with the foot cylinder by means of the boards independently of the bars ; the boards being hollowed out in the proper places to admit the observation of coincidences .
To detect where the leakage took place , the interior of the apparatus was filled with water as high as the lower glass cylinder , and a communication being established between the exhausting pipe and the upper part of the interior , the air was withdrawn ; when bubbles of air were seen to rise rapidly from the interior surface of the iron foot cylinder , particularly from those parts of it which were opposite the flanches on the outside , where the metal was 216 thickest .
An iron cement , composed of cast iron filings and white lead , was then rubbed strongly into the porous parts of the cast iron ; and several coats of oil paint were given successively , both to the outside and inside of the cylinder .
These alterations having been made , the apparatus was again established in front of the clock , and prepared for a second experiment .

Every thing was arranged on this day as in the first experiment , with the exception of the above alterations , and the removal of the telescope for observing coincidences nearer the pendulum , from which it was now distant 11 feet .
The diaphragm and arc were also placed within the glasses , instead of being between the glasses and the clock .
The graduated arc was 48 inches below the point of suspension , whence the registered arc required to be multiplied by.87 to produce the true arc .

The cement and paint had been effectual in preventing the leakage ; from half past ten on the evening of the 13th to half past eight on the following morning , as shown in the table , and subsequently until 1 P.M. on the same day , when the pendulum was still vibrating , but in an arc too small to admit of the observation of coincidences , the gauge at 1.8 underwent no perceptible change .
The introduction of the oak boards had also contributed considerably to the firmness of the suspension plate : the excess of vibration on an immoveable support 'being reduced from 18 vibrations a day in the former experiment to 51 in the present ; whilst the accordance of the results on the two occasions furnishing the reduction to a vacuum , gave reason to conclude , that the comparative 218 vibration in the air of full pressure and in rarefied air was not sensibly affected by a small motion of the support .
It was now considered , therefore , as established by the experiments , that the true reduction to a vacuum is considerably greater than it had been customary to suppose ; for the invariable pendulum , for example , nearly as 5 to 3 .
It was also obvious , that all pendulums whatsoever , employed in air , and designed to give results which should be independent of the variable retardation occasioned by their vibration in air , would require to have the influence of the air on their respective vibrations , ascertained by experiment , since it is not attainable by calculation .
Now as the apparatus was suited by its construction , to furnish this element with facility and accuracy , for any of the forms in which pendulums have hitherto been made , either for determining absolute or relative lengths , it was probable that it might eventually become more extensively useful , than in its present office of furnishing the reduction for an invariable pendulum .
It was thought proper , therefore , that the apparatus should be removed to the Royal Observatory at Greenwich and established there , in order that it might be hereafter at the command of persons to whom it Inight be useful , upon their application to the Board of Longitude at whose expense it had been constructed .
The iron suspension plate with the iron bars supporting it were now removed , and the bell metal plate with the circular exterior ring , represented in Plate VI , substituted , with the iron frame-work and screws , as represented elsewhere in the plate , enabling the support of the pendulum to be fixed immovably at pleasure in the manner already described .
A clock by DENT , with a mercurial pendulum carrying a disk , was placed in the angle behind the apparatus ; and the telescope for observing coincidences in front , about 16 feet distant from the detached pendulum when suspended .
Arrangements were made for observing the coincidences by artificial light , without iilterfering with the temperature of the room , by directing the light of an Argand lamp , stationed in an adjoining apartment , on the disk of the clock pendulum , through a tin tube , which prevented the diffusion of the light in the room .
The diaphragm was placed between the glasses and the clock , and the arc within the glasses close to the pendulum .
The arc was graduated in inches and tenths , and was read off to hundredths ; crossing the pendulum at 47.7 inches from 2F2 219 the point of suspension , the registered divisions multiplied by 1.2 give the arc in degrees and parts .
In addition to the mercurial gauge , a mercurial barometer was suspended within the glasses , having a glass tube and cistern , the latter sufficiently capacious to receive , if necessary , the whole of the mercury in the tube ; an inch of mercury descending from the tiube raised the level of the mercury in the cistern TTgth of an inch : the scale was marked in red lines on the glass tube .
The range of the mercurial gauge not exceeding 10 inches , the barometer was necessary for pressures between 10 inches and the full pressure of the external atmosphere .
Comparing it , when suspended in its place , with the standard barometer of the Observatory , its indication , at about 30 inches , was found to require an additive correction of 0.32 in.ch ; the standard being corrected for capillary action , but the barometer of the apparatus uncorrected , as the interior diameter of the tube was not precisely known .
The air:being then withdrawn from the apparatus until the gauge was brought in action , the barometer was found to require an additive correction of 0.41 inch after the correction for the level of the cistern , to make it agree with the mean indication of the two legs of the gauge ; which mean was observed throughout .
This barometer being only used at 14 inches and thereabouts , an additive correction of 032 +041 _ 0.36 is applied to its registry ; which may be presumed to give a comparative indication to the gauge and standard barometer within a tenth of an inch .
The two thermometers enclosed in a sealed glass cylinder , from the interior of which the air had been withdrawn , were suspended by the side of the standard thermometer : these thermometers are numbered 2 and 3 in the subsequent tables ; the standard is No. 1 ; and an exterior thermometer , suspended in the free air near the apparatus , and at the same level as the thermometers within the glasses , is No. 4 .
In consequence of my absence from England , the experiments with the invariable pendulum in the apparatus were suspended until January of the present year , when they were resumed with the valuable assistance and cooperation of Mr. THOMAS GLANVILLE TAYLOR of the Royal Observatory , whose observations are distinguished in the subsequent pages by his name .
The invariable pendulum No. 12 , employed in the preceding experiments , being at this tinle engaged in other determinations , I obtained permission to detain and employ 220 Obsa Capt SABI OF THE VIBRATIONS OF AN INVARIABLE PENDULUM .
221 for the present purpose , a similar pendulum , No. 13 , destined eventually for the Brussels Observatory .
The arrangement of the observations in each of the succeeding experiments was the same as in those already related ; the pendulum was first vibrated in air of full pressure ; then in a rarefied medium ; and lastly , again in the air .
A mean was then taken between the two series in air ; with which mean , the intermediate vibration in the rarefied medium was compared .
The result of the comparison was thus wholly independent of the daily rate of the clock ; and in some measure also , of its deviations from an uniform rate in intervals less than 24 hours .
The clock was compared daily with the transit clock of the observatory ; but as the weather in the last half of January and first half of February was very rarely clear , and as the transit clock about that period was more than usually irregular in its going , it has been deemed preferable to take a mean rate for the coincidence clock for the months of January and February ; its deviations from this mean rate on the days of experiment are transferred in appearance to the going of the pendulum on different days : this apparent irregularity is however wholly inconsequential in respect to the purpose of the present experiments , for which it is only necessary that the vibrations of the pendulum should be relative in the three series of coincidences forming each distinct experiment .

This experiment was undertaken for a distinct purpose ; that of ascertaining the comparative retardation of a pendulum vibrating in an atmosphere of hydrogen gas , and in an atmosphere of common air .
It had been suggested to me by Mr. WILLIAM HASLEDYNE PEPYS , that a nearer practical approach to the vibration in a vacuum , than the pump had hitherto effected , might be accomplished , by filling the apparatus with hydrogen gas , and pumping out to the extent that the pump could carry the process of exhaustion ; when the small portion of the gas remaining in the apparatus , being 13 times lighter than a remainder of air which would effect the gauge to an equal amount , might be expected to have an influence on the vibration diminished in the ratio of the respective specific gravities of air and hydrogen .
To ascertain , therefore , whether the retardations of air and hydrogen gas were in that ratio was the object of this experiment , which was accomplished by vibrating the pendulum , lst , in the ordinary atmosphere ; and 2nd , in an atmosphere of hydrogen gas , of equal pressure , or as nearly so as circumstances would permit .

A fresh supply of gas was then -introduced , passing through the cylinder containing fresh muriate of lime , till the pressure withinside the apparatus exceeded by about 0.2 inch the pressure of the atmosphere on the exterior .
An equilibrium of pressure was then produced , by permitting the escape of the small portion of gas necessary for that purpose .

The vibrations in this experiment were as follows : In hydrogen gas February 9. .

228 Whence it appears that at the same height of the barometer , 30.193 inches , the pendulum made 8.515 vibrations per diem more in hydrogen gas than in atmospheric air ; the temperature of the gas being 390.32 , and of the air 38 ?

The hydrogen gas was obtained under Mr. NEWMAN'S superintendence , by the action of zinc upon dilute sulphuric acid ; and was collected in a gasometer previous to its transfer into the apparatus , which was effected through the metallic pipe usually connected with the air-pump .
The cylinder containing muriate of lime was made a part of the communication between the apparatus and the gasometer .

86314.9E A bottle was then carefully filled with the hydrogen gas from the apparatus by Mr. NEWMAN , and conveyed by him to Mr. FARADAY at the Royal Institution for examination , from whom I have since received the following note .
" I have examined the hydrogen gas , and find no appreciable quantity of air in it .
If it contains any , it is less than 2 Oodth part ; and this I think will be as nothing in your experiments .
" The remainder of the hydrogen was then pumped out of the apparatus to C rA TA the extent that the state of the pump would permit , which left the gauge at 0.8 inch : when the following observations were made .

** * pressure of the gas was 30.120 inches : being a difference of 1.95 vibration per diem , corresponding to a barometric difference of 29.248 inch .
of hydrogen gas : the temperature of the gas being 39 ?
.75 in the compressed , and 40.72 in the rarefied state .
We have in this and the preceding experiment , data for deductions on three distinct points : 1st , on the retardation occasioned by an atmosphere of hydrogen gas : 2nd , on the retardation occasioned by an atmosphere of common air : and 3rd , on the comparative retardation in air and in hydrogen gas .
1st .
From the results of Exp. VIII , we have 1.95 vibr .
per diem , corresponding to 29.248 inches of the barometer of hydrogen gas ; whence 2 vibrations per diem is the reduction to a vacuum for hydrogen gas of 40 ?
under 30 inches pressure : and the number of vibrations per diem of the pendtulum in a vacuum , derived from the vibrations in hydrogen gas , is 86316.95 .
2nd .
We have the vibrations in a vacuum 86316.95 , the number in atmospheric air 86306.39 , = 10.56 vibrations per diem ; which is therefore the reduction to a vacuum for 30.113 inches of air at 41 ?
.25 .
3rd .
We have the ratio of the retardations occasioned by air and hydrogen gas , both at 40 ?
and under a pressure of 30 inches , as 10.55 : 2 .
Combining the VIIth and VIIIth Experiments , we have corroborative results on the 2nd and 3rd points , from the vibrations in air and hydrogen gas on the 9th and 10th of February .
The pendulum in Exp. VII .
made 86314.085 vibrations in hydrogen gas of 39 ?
.32 under 30.192 inches pressure ; equivalent to 86314.085 + 2.01 = 86316.095 in a vacuum .
The vibrations in atmospheric air in the same experiment were 86305.57 ; Barom. 30.193 ; and temperature of air 38.1 : whence the reduction to a vacuum for air of that temperature , and under that pressure , is 86316.095 86305.57 = 10.525 vibrations per diem .
And the ratio of the retardations in air and in hydrogen gas , both at 40 ?
, and under 30 inches barometric pressure , is as 10.41 : 2 .
Bringing together the two results in regard to this ratio , we have 10.55 : 2 ; and 10.41 : 2 .
Or generally , the retardation in air , is to that in hydrogen gas , as 51 : 1 .
Now the ratio of the densities of air and hydrogen gas being about as 13 : , if the resistance of the elastic fluids to bodies falling through them were simply as the respective densities of the fluids , the retardation occasioned by air should be 13 times as great as that occasioned by hydrogen gas .
The difference of this ratio from that shown by experiment is greater than can well be 231 ascribed to accidental error in the experiment , particularly as repetition produced results almost identical .
May it not indicate an inherent property in the elastic fluids , analogous to that of viscidity in liquids , of resistance to the motion of bodies passing through them , independently of their density ?
a property , in such case , possessed by air and hydrogen gas in very different degrees ; since it would appear from the experiments , that the ratio of the resistance of hydrogen gas to that of air is more than double the ratio following from their densities .
Should the existence of such a distinct property of resistance , varying in the different elastic fluids , be confirmed by experiments now in progress with other gases , an apparatus more suitable than the present to investigate the ratio in which it is possessed by them , could scarcely be devised : and the pendulum , in addition to its many important and useful purposes in general physics , may find an application for its very delicate , but , with due precaution , not more delicate than certain , determinations , in the domain of chemistry .
EXPERIMENTS IX , X , XI .
These experiments are classed together , their object being the same , and distinct from any of the preceding .
It yet remained to be established by experiment , that with a free communication between the interior of the apparatus and the external air , the pendulum , vibrating within the glasses , made the same number of vibrations as if the glasses had not been present .
For this purpose the foot screws of the apparatus were simultaneously lowered , so as to detach the upper of the three middle glasses from the suspension piece .
The glasses could then be removed , and replaced , in successive observations ; the apparatus being in the same state , with the glasses replaced , as in the observation in air in the preceding experiments , with the exception of a disjunction of less than the tenth of an inch between the upper glass and the suspension plate .

Collecting the three results in one view , they are as follows : Feb. 17 .

Exp. X. The vibrations within the glasses in defect 0.15 Feb. 22 .
Exp. XI .
The vibrations within the glasses in defect 0.21 Mean .
The vibrations within the glasses in defect 0.007 per diem .
We may therefore conclude that the vibration in air within the glasses , and in the free air of the apartment , the glasses being removed , will lead by sufficient repetition to an identical result .
Finally , the knife edge being examined , was found apparently as clean and sharp as when first used .
The agate planes had retained their horizontality ; and the screws securing the planes to the circular plate , and the plate to the iron frame , were as tight as when the experiments were commenced .
We have now to collect in one view the several results , from whence the reduction to a vacuum for an invariable pendulum vibrating in air is to be derived .

To exhibit the degree of approximation , with which the result of each of the experiments , combined in producing this mean determination , is represented by it , we may compute the several retardations corresponding to the circumstances of each experiment , and place the computed retardations in comparison with the results of actual observation .

--0.08 Hence we may perceive , that were the reduction to a vacuum separately de-rived from each of the eight experiments , it would in no instance differ more than 0.14 of a vibration from the adopted determination .
In other words , the greatest difference that would be occasioned , by deriving the reduction , whibch it was the object of these experiments to obtain , from any single experiment , instead of from the mean of the whole , would in no case exceed I th part of the amount of the reduction .
The " correction for buoyancy , " or the reduction that would have been previously computed , for the vibrations of a pendulum in air of 450 , under a pressure of 30 inches , is 6.26 vibrations per diem .
The actual retardation is therefore 4.1 vibrations per diem greater than had been supposed ; and the proportion , which the experimental reduction bears to that which is now shown to have been erroneous , is as 1.655 to 1 .
In considering the modifications , which the substitution of the true for the erroneous reduction to a vacuum will introduce , in the results obtained with 236 invariable pendulums on the variation of gravity at different parts of the earth 's surface , we may remark , in the first place , that such results , being merely relative , are not liable to more than a very small proportion of those considerable derangements , in which all determinations hitherto made of the absolute length of the pendulum are involved .
The error to which the relative results of invariable pendulums are liable , is limited , in all cases , to a function of the difference in the amount of the buoyancy at different stations , caused by variations in the atmospheric circumstances .
With pendulums of the form and unaterials of those used in the present experiments , we obtain from the results , 0.65 , as the co-efficient of the difference ; or in other words , the error to which the results are liable is about two-thirds of the difference in the amount of the correction for buoyancy computed for the different stations .
The proportion of this error , occasioned by barometric variations , cannot be otherwise than extremely small , in all cases of comparison between stations little removed from the level of the sea .
The specific gravity of the pendulum being about 8.6 , an inch in the height of the barometer will correspond in buoyancy to about.21 of a vibration a day , which multiplied by 0.65 is about 0.14 of a vibration .
In the comparison of tropical and extra-tropical stations , the barometer in the middle and high latitudes is liable to fluctuate an inch , and even in extreme cases more than an inch , from the ] mean height , which is uniform , or nearly so within the tropics : but as the observations generally include several days at each station , and as in proportion to their continuance the barometer will approximate to its mean height , it will be found , on consulting the record of pendulum experiments , that a difference of half an inch in the barometric height at two stations is a rare occurrence .
The correction for half an inch is not more than 0.07 of a vibration , to be added to the number of daily vibrations at the station where the barometer was highest .
The liability to error from variations of temperature at different stations is , however , far more considerable than from variations of the barometer : sufficiently so , indeed , to become , in some cases , influential on the ellipticity deduced .
A difference of 400 of FAHRENHEIT is by no means of rare occurrence between the tropics and the high latitudes ; and as 16 ?
of FAHR. are equivalent , in their influence on the density of the air , to one inch of the barometer , the error in such case nay amount to 0.52 X 0.65 = 0.34 of a vibration per diem .
Moreover , as the 237 difference of temperature is always in favour of the tropical stations , the error will be of a constant nature , unlike the greater part of the small irregularities to which pendulum experiments are liable , which may compensate themselves by the multiplication of the experiments .
The stations which I have myself visited with the pendulum embrace a greater range and variety of temperature , I believe , than those of any other experimentalist .
The preceding remarks would therefore apply particularly to them , but for a circumstance which has fortunately occasioned , in all cases , a compensation of the errors , which would otherwise have arisen from the influence of the variations of temperature on the density of the air .
This compensation is a consequence of the " correction for temperature , " ( i. e. the correction of the vibrations for the temperature of the the pendulum , ) having been obtained by the peculiarly practical mode , of vibrating the pendulum in London in temperatures differing so widely as to include the whole range experienced elsewhere , -instead of deriving the correction from the expansion of the e metal in pyrometric experiments .
Had the vibrations at high and low temperatures in London , from which the correction for temperature was obtained , been reduced to a vacuum by the true reduction , as it is now known , -instead of by the " correction for buoyancy , " which was then thought to constitute the true reduction , the value of a degree of FAHR. on the daily vibration would have been found 0.43 instead of 0.421 .
Thie first of these numbers is the true correction for temperature due to the expansion of the metal ; the second is that correction diminished by the effect of a degree of temperature on the part of the reduction to a vacuum heretofore neglected .
It is the second number ( 0.421 ) which has been used throughout the experiments to which I allude , in reducing them to a mean term of comparison ; consequently the corrections for temperature so applied are every where too small , if regarded as representing only the effect of the expansion of the metal on the vibrations of the pendulum ; but they are experimentally correct , when regarded as rIepresenting the joint effects of the expansion of the metal , and of the difference of temperature on the part of the reduction to a vacuum not comprehended in the correction for buoyancy .
The effect of differences of barometric height on the results of those experiments is too inconsiderable to require express correction ; not exceeding 0.02 238 .
of a vibration in the mean acceleration of the pendulum derived from the comparison of the tropical and extra-tropical stations .
The recalculation of those experiments , therefore , with the more correct elements of reduction that we now possess , would have no other effect than that of adding an equal amount to the number of vibrations of the experimental pendulum at every station : or an amount so nearly equal , that the difference is wholly inconsequential : leaving the acceleration of the pendulum at the different stations , which was the object of research , as already deduced .
