On the Syminetric Functions of the Roots of certain Systems of two Equatiozs .
By ARTHUR CAYLEY , Esq.,.BR .
S. Received December 18 , 1856 , -Read January 8 , 1857 , SUPPOSE in general that p=O , 4-=O , &amp;c. denote a system of ( n-1 ) equations between the n variables ( x , y , z,. .
) , where the functions p , 4 .
, &amp;c. are quantics ( i. e. rational and integral homogeneous functions ) of the variables .
Any values ( xl , y , , zl,. .
) satisfying the equations , are said to constitute a set of roots of the system ; the roots of the same set are , it is clear , only determinate to a common factor pres , i. e. only the ratios inter se and not the absolute magnitudes of the roots of a set are determinate .
The number of sets , or the degree of the system , is equal to the product of the degrees of the component equations .
Imagine a function of the roots which remains unaltered when any two sets ( x1 , yi , z1 ... ) and ( X2 , y2 , z2,. .
) are interchanged ( that is , when x , and x2 , y1 and y2 , &amp;c. are simultaneously interchanged ) , and which is besides homogeneous of the same degree as regards each entire set of roots , although not of necessity homogeneous as regards the different roots of the same set ; thus , for example , if the sets are ( X , i y , ) , ( X2 , y2 ) , then the functions x , x2 , x , y2+x2y , , yly2 are each of them of the form in question ; but the first and third of these functions , although homogeneous of the first degree in regard to each entire set , are not homogeneous as regards the two variables of each set .
A function of the above-mentioned form may , for shortness , be termed a symmetric function of the roots ; such function ( disregarding an arbitrary factor depending on the common factors which enter implicitly into the different sets of roots ) will be a rational and integral function of the coefficients of the equations , i. e. any symmetric function of the roots may be considered as a rational and integral function of the coefficients .
The general process for the investigation of such expression for a symmetric function of the roots is indicated in Professor SCHLXFLI'S Memoir , " Ueber die Resultante eines Systemes mehrerer algebraischer Gleichungen , " Vienna Transactions , t. iv .
( 1852 ) .
The process is as follows:-Suppose that we know the resultant of a system of equations , one or more of them being linear ; then if p=O be the linear equation or one of the linear equations of the system , the resultant will be of the form 'pp2. .
, where pll , 9,2 &amp;c. are what the function p becomes upon substituting therein the different sets ( x , , y , , zi. .
) , ( x2 , y2 , z2. .
) of the remaining ( n-1 ) equations -=O0 , X=0 , &amp;c. ; comparing such expression with the given value of the resultant , we have expressed in terms of the coefficients of the functions 4 , X , &amp;c. , certain symmetric functions which may be called the fundamental symmetric functions of the roots of the system.4 ?
=0 , == 0 , &amp;c. ; these are in fact the symmetric functions of the first degree in respect to each set of roots .
By the aid of these fundamental symmetric functions , the other symmetric functions of the roots of the system -/ =0 , = =0 , &amp;c. may be expressed in terms of the coefficients , and then com THE SYMMETRIC FUNCTIONS bining with these equations a non-linear equation ( D=0 , the resultant of the system ( '=0 , ==0O , %=0 , &amp;c. will be what the function C1P , ( 2 ... becomes , upon substituting therein for the different symmetric functions of the roots of the system P= 0 , X= 0 , &amp;c. the expressions for these functions in terms of the coefficients .
We thus pass from the resultant of a system =0 , / -=0 , =-0 , &amp;c. , to that of a system &gt; -=0 , -=0 , %=0 , &amp;c. , in which the linear function p is replaced by the non-linear function ( P. By what has preceded , the symmetric functions of the roots of a system of ( n-1 ) equations depend on the resultant of the system obtained by combining the ( n ) equations with an arbitrary linear equation ; and moreover , the resultant of any system of n equations depends ultimately upon the resultant of a system of the same number of equations , all except one being linear ; but in this case the linear equations determine the ratios of the variables or ( disregarding a common factor ) the values of the variables , and by substituting these values in the remaining equation we have the resultant of the system .
The process leads , therefore , to the expressions for the symmetric functions of the roots of any system of ( n-1 ) equations , and also to the expression for the resultant of any system of n equations .
Professor SCHLAPLI discusses in the general case the problem of showing how the expressions for the fundamental symmetric functions lead to those of the other symmetric functions , but it is not necessary to speak further of this portion of his investigations .
The object of the present Memoir is to apply the process to two particular cases , viz. I propose to obtain thereby the expressions for the simplest symmetric tions ; that is , first , a linear equation and a quadric equation ; and secondly , a linear equation and a cubic equation .
First , consider the two equations ( a , b , c , f , g , ha , y , )2 =0 , ( al ?

By forming the powers and products of the second order a2 , ab , &amp;c. , we obtain linear relations between the symmetric functions of the second degree in respect to each set of roots .
The number of equations is precisely equal to that of the symmetric functions of the form in question , and the solution of the linear equations gives12 b2,2 22 22 bc= -Yl ZY2Z2z ca = zl1lZ2X2 , ab=xy1X2 , y2 , 4f2 2bc=y z2+y 4g22ca = ZX2-+ Z22 4h2-2ab Xy2 2+ xy , 2af x-syl xz2+ ZX1X2 y2 , 2bg=yl , zIx2y2+X l-y , y 2ch = zxly1-z2+ yl z 2x2 , 4gh-2af =x , y2z2+x2y , z , , 4hf-2bg=y z2x2+y2zlal , 4fg --2ch = z12xy2-+ Zx , y , 2bf =yy2z2+ z= .

The expressions for the symmetric functions of the third degree considered as functions of a , b , c , f , g , h , are consequently not absolutely determinate , but they may be modified by the addition of the term X(abc-af2 -bg2--ch2+2fgh ) , where X is an indeterminate numerical coefficient .
The simplest expressions are those obtained by disregarding the preceding equation for fgh , and the entire system then becomesa3 =x3x , b3 33 c3 =Z 33 bc =y-lZ , y'2Z2 ca =z^Xwzex2 , ab =xy ZxylX2 bc2 =yZ1y22z , ca2 =Z2wz 2 , ab2 =xyx2y2 , abc =xlylx 1X22z2 720 2a2f 2b2g = 2ch 2ag = 2b2h 2c2f 2a2h = 2b2f 2c2g = 2bcf 2cag= 2abh=.Z/ 2Z 2 Z/ g2Xiz/ , 2 21 22 111XZ Y2+2IYi ' z , yz2X+2 zX2yZz1 , 3ylXy2 +y2lyl 323'2 3y2Z2+ 324/ 14 3222 zy~.x~2+ s^ Y12Zly2Z ++y2Z2ylz , 22 12 222T 2X , ZJX $2 X222y 2Y22yalyl 2bcg=y , zx2 , yi2z +zy2 , x , yz1 , , 2cah = zx xayz2 +Z 2lXIYZ , , 2abf =x , y2 , xy2z + x2y2xy , ,z , 2bch =y Z , xy2 z2Y +y21ixyI , 2caf = z2xx I2 , Y22+ zx21axy , I , 2abg= xyx2y Z2+x y2z , gYlX2y2 2 --2 , Y 2XeA 4af2 -2abc= 4bg2 2abc= 4ch2 -2abc-4bf2 -2b2c 4cg2 -2c2a = 4ah2 -2a2b = 4cf2 -2bc2 = 4ag2 --2ca2 = 4bh2 -2ab2= 4agh-2a2f = 4bhf-2b2g = 4cfg -2c2h = 2z2 zz22 vly2 +ywX22lI Z ?

&amp;c. , viz. we have ( a , 3 , y)x3 , yl , zl)=0 , ( 3 , ) , rXx2 , Y2 , Z2)= 0 ( , P , 'yX3 , Y37 , Z3)=0 , and thence eliminating the coefficients ( a , 3 , y ) , we find V X= , y2z3+ 2y3Z1 + 1y3Z2xly3z2-yXyZ-Xy3z = O. By forming the powers and products of the second degree a2 , ab , &amp;c. , we obtain 55 equations between the symmetric functions of the second degree in each set of roots .
But we have V2=0=a symmetric function of the roots ; and thus the entire number of linear relations is 56 , and this is in fact the number of the symmetric functions of the second degree in each set .
I use for shortness the sign S to denote the sum of the distinct terms obtained by permuting the different sets of roots , so that the equations for the fundamental symmetric functions area = X1X2231 b= yly2Y3 , C= Zi Z2 ZX 3f =Sy , y2z3 , 3g =S z , z2x , 3h=S 1x2xy3 , 3i S y , Z Z3 , 3j =S z x2x , 3k=S x , yy3 , 61 =S xly2Z2 ; then the complete system of expressions for the symmetric functions of the second orlder is as follows , viz.a2222 C2 22c =2zz2z , bc = y , zyz2 z2 , y3 ca 12 2z2x3 , Ca = Z1 X1Z2X2Z3 X3 , ab= XIy1xy2x3y3 , 3af =S x1y1x2y2zyx3 , 3bg= S y1z1y2zx23y 3ch =S zI xx z2x2y z3 , 3bf =S y~yy3z , 3cg =S z~ xz z3x , 3ah =S xx3y23 , 3cf =S y , z , y22 z3 , 3ag =S z,11 x z2x2x , 3bh=S x , y , x , y2y3 , 3ai =S x , y , z2x2zx3 , 3bj =S yIz , X2y2x3y3 , 3ck =S zI , x , y2Y3Z3 , 724 3bi =S y y , z , y z3 , 3cj =S z zx2z3x3 , x 3ak =S xlx , ,y , xy , 3ci =S y , z1 z~z , 3aj =S zlx , lXX , 3bk=S xyly2yi , 6al -S x2x2y2z3x3 , 6bl =S y2z2x3y3 , 6cl =S zz2 , xy3z , 9f2 -6bi=S y2y2Z 9g2 -6cj =S z z2x2 , 9h2 -6ak=S Ix2y3 9i2 -6cf=S y z2 , 9j2 -6ag=S = z2x2 9k2 -6bh=S x2y2y 9fg-3ck=S x , y , z2x , 9gh-3ai =S y , z , z2xx2 , 9hf-3bj =S z 3xx2yyi2 , 9jk 3af =S x2x2y2y3 35 9ki 3bg= S y2y,2z2zx3 , 9ij -3ch=S z z2x2x3y3 , 9fi -3bc =S y-y2 , z2z , 9gj -3ca Sz 2x2~x , 9hk-3ab=S 1x22y2y --~~x2xyy .

As an instance of the application of the formulae , let it be required to eliminate the variables from the three equations , ( a , b , c , f , g , h , i , j , jk , I &lt; x , y , z)3= 0 , ( a ' , 6 ' , c ' , f ' , f h ' )x , y , z)2= 0 , ( a , P , y Xx , y , z ) -0 .
This may be done in two different ways ; first , representing the roots of the linear equation and the quadric equation by ( x , , y , , z , ) , ( x2 , y2 , z2 ) , the resultant will be ( a,..(XI , yl ) z , )3 .
( a,..C , y , Z2)3 , which is equal to a2 xxS + &amp;c. , where the symmetric functions , x23 &amp;c. are given by the formula a'33x , &amp;c. , where the coefficients of the quadratic equation being ( a ' , b ' , c ' , f ' , g ' , h ' ) I have written a ' instead of a. Next , if the roots of the linear equation and the cubic equation are represented by ( x , , y , , z , ) , ( x , y2 , z2 ) , ( X3 , y , , z3 ) , then the resultant will be ( a'..X , y , z , ).(a',..x , y X2 , Y , Z)2(a',..X3 , , y , , 3)2 , which is equal to a'3 42x22qx_+ &amp;c. , the symmetric functions ex , 'eJ , &amp;c. being given by the formulae a2 2=x2x , &amp;c. The expression for the Resultant is in each case of the right degree , viz. of the degrees 6 , 3 , 2 , in the coefficients of the linear , the quadric , and the cubic equations respectively : the two expressions , therefore , can only differ by a numerical factor , which might be determined without difficulty .
The third expression for the resultant , viz. ( a , 7 , rX , l , YI , zi ) ( M , )X .
, Y2 , Y2 2 ) ... , ( , X6 , y ) , Zg ) , ( where ( x , , y , , ),. .
( x6 , y6 , Z6 ) are the roots of the cubic and quadratic equations ) compared with the foregoing value , leads to expressions for the fundamental symmetric functions of the cubic and quadratic equations , and thence to expressions for the other symmetric functions of these two equations ; but it would be difficult to obtain the actually developed values even of the fundamental symmetric functions .
I hope to return to the subject , and consider in a general point of view the question of the formation of the expressions for the other symmetric functions by means of the expressions for the fundamental symmetric functions .
