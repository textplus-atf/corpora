A MIetbod of examining refractive and dispersive Powers , by prismatic Reflection .
By William Hyde Wollaston , M. D. F. R.S. Read June 24 , i8o.0 IN examining the power with which various substances refract and disperse light , I have for some time past employed a method unnoticed by writers on optical subjects ; and , as it is not only convenient in common cases of refraction , but also capable of affording results not attainable by other means , I have been induced to draw up a short account of the method itself , and of the most remarkable instances of its application .
This method was suggested by a consideration of Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S prismatic eye-glass , the principle of which depends on the reflection of light at the inner surface of a dense refracting medium .
Since the range of inclination within which total reflection takes place , depends not only on the density of the reflecting prism , but also on the rarity of the medium adjacent to it , the extent of that range varies with the difference of the densities of the two media .
When , therefore , the refractive power of one medium is known , that of any rarer medium may be learned , by examining at what angle a ray of light will be reflected from it .
For instance , when any object is laid under a prism of flintglass , with air alone interposed , the internal angle of incidence at which the visual ray begins to be totaily reflected , and at which the object ceases to be seen by refraction , is about 39 ?
o ' ; but , when the object has been dipped in water , and brought into contact with the glass , it continues visible , by means of the higher refractive power of the water , as far as 57- ?
of incidence .
When any kind of oil , or any resinous cement , is interposed , this angle is still greater , according to the refractive power of the medium employed ; and , by cements that refract more strongly than the glass , the object may be seen through the prism , at whatever angle of incidence it is viewed .
In examining the refractive powers of fluids , or of fusible substances , the requisite contact is easily obtained ; but , with solids , which can in few instances be made to touch to any great extent , this cannot be effected without the interposition of some fluid , or cement , of higher refractive power than the medium under examination .
Since the surfaces of a stratum so interposed are parallel , it will not effect the total deviation of a ray passing through it , and may therefore be employed without risk of any error in consequence .
Thus , resin , or oil of sassafras , interposed between plate glass and any other prism , will not alter the result .
If , on the same prism , a piece of selenite and another of plateglass be cemented near each other , their powers may be compared with the same accuracy as if they were both in absolute contact with it .
For such a mere comparison of any two bodies , a common triangular prism is best adapted ; but , for the purpose of actual measurement of refractive powers , I have preferred the use of a square prism , because , with a very simple apparatus , it shows the sine of refractive power sought , without the need of any calculation .
366 Let A , Fig. i , Plate XIV .
be a square or rectangular prism , to which any substance is applied at b , and let any ray of light parallel to cb be refracted through the prism , in the direction bde .
Then , if of and ed be taken proportional to the sines that represent the refractive powers of the prism and of air , fJg , which is intercepted between j and the perpendicular eg , will be the corresponding sine to represent the refractive power of the medium b. For , since edg ( opposite to of ) is the angle of refraction , efg ( opposite to ed ) must be equal to the angle of incidence bdh ; and of :fg : : bd : dh : : sine of cbi : sine of hbd .
All therefore that is requisite for determining the refractive power of h , is to find means of measuring the line fg .
On this principle , the instrument in the annexed sketch ( Fig. 2 .
) is constructed .
On a board ab is fixed a piece of flat deal cd , to Which , by a hinge at d , is jointed a second piece de , io inches long , carrying two plane sights at its extremities .
At e is a second hinge , connecting of , 15,83 inches long ; and a third at the other extremity of of ; by whichfg is connected with it .
At i also is a hinge , uniting the radius ig to the middle of of ; and then , since g moves in a semicircle egf , a line joining e and g would be perpendicular tofg .
The piece cd has a cavity in the middle of it , so that , when any substance is applied to the middle of the prism P , it may continue to rest horizontally on its extremities .
When ed has been so elevated that the yellow rays in the fringe of colours ( observable where perfect reflection terminates ) are seen through the sights , the point g , by means of a vernier which it carries , shows by inspection the length of the sine of refraction sought .
The advantages which this method possesses above the usual mode of examining refractive powers , are greater than they may at first sight appear .
The usual practice has been , to form two surfaces of the substance under examination , so inclined to each other that the deviation occasioned by them might be measured .
The inclination of these surfaces to each other must also be known ; and thence the refractive power might be computed .
But , in the method here proposed , it is sufficient to have only one surface , and the result is obtained at once , without computation .
The facility of determining refractive powers , is consequently such as to render this property of bodies a very convenient test in many philosophical inquiries .
For discovering the purity of essential oils , such an examination may be of considerable utility , on account of the smallness of the quantity requisite for trial .
In oil of cloves , for instance , I have met with a wide difference .
The refractive power of genuine oil of cloves , is as high as 1,535 ; but I have also purchased oil by this name , which did not exceed 1,498 , and which had probably been adulterated by some less refractive oil .
For such purposes , the refractive power of opaque substances may often be deserving of inquiry , which could not be learned by any means at present in use .
For , in the usual mode , a certain degree of transparency is absolutely necessary ; but , for trial by contact , the most perfect opacity does not occasion .
the least impediment .
Among other instances in which I have taken advantage of this circumstance , I may mention a substance that had been found in one of the islands of the North Pacific Ocean , which , to all outward appearance and by various trials , seemed to be perfect bees-wax , although it is supposed that there are no bees in the island from which it was brought .
On placing it by the side of a piece of bees-wax , in contact with a prism , the perfect equality of their refractive powers afforded a strong confirmation of the opinion before formed of their identity .
For the examination also of media of which the refractive density is not uniform , the general method of trial by deviation wholly fails ; on the contrary , by placing a varied medium in contact with a prism , all its gradations of density , from greatest to least , become at once the object of mere inspection .
An instance of this may very readily be seen with a piece of gum , the surface of which has been moistened for a few minutes ; when , by close application to a prism , a refractive power may be discerned , varying from that of the water on the surface , 1,336 , to nearly 1,51 , the refractive power of gum arabic .
I should not so much insist on this advantage , were it not for the opportunity hereby afforded of examining the crystalline lens of the eye , which is now known to be generally more dense in the centre than at its surface .
Mr. HAUKSBEE , who was not aware of this difference , has estimated the refractive power of the crystalline lens , by forming it into a wedge by plates of glass , somewhat higher than I find it to be ; but , with his accustomed accuracy , he remarked the apparent enlargement of an object , occasioned by the variations of its density , which he was unable to explain .
In the table that follows , I have set down , -not only the limits of refractive power in a crystalline lens of an ox , ascertained by trial , but also an average , computed from the refractive density of a dried crystalline of an ox , of which the weight had been first taken in the recent state , and the quantity of water lost by drying also measured .
36,9 The table exhibits a series of substances , arranged according to their refractive powers .
That of the diamond is copied from Sir ISAAC NEWTON ; of other bodies to which ( on account of their being more dense than glass ) the machine for measurement would not apply , the refractive powers have been found by other means , for the sake of furnishing a more continued series of subjects for comparative experiments .
The rest have been compared by this method ; and their power , when expressed in numbers , actually measured .

The method above described for investigating refractive powers , may also be employed with similar advantage for inquiries into the dispersion of light by different bodies , and the consequences that result from their combined action .
When a glass prism is placed in contact with water , and brought near the eye , in such a position that it reflects the light from a window , the extent of perfect reflection is seen to be bounded by a fringe of the prismatic colours , in the order of their refrangibility.* The violet rays , being in this case the most refrangible , appear strongest and lowest , on account of the less obliquity that is requisite for their reflection , But it may happen that two media , which refract unequally at the same incidence , may disperse equally at that incidence .
Under these circumstances , a pencil of rays passing from one of such media into the other , will be refracted , without dispersion of its colours .
The boundary of prismatic reflection would then be found a well defined line , free from colour , if the surface at which the reflected light emerges from the prism were at right angles to its course .
When the disparity of the dispersive powers of the media is still greater , it may also happen , that the usual order of prismatic colours will be reversed ; and then the red will appear strongest and lowest in the fringe , unless the colours so produced are counteracted by refraction at their emergence from the prism .
An instance in which the colours are so reversed , may be seen by application of oil of sassafras to a prism of flint glass .
So high is the dispersive power of this oil , that , in refractions from flint glass into it , the red rays are refracted more than the violet .
It must be observed that , in this experiment , when the angle of reflection within a triangular prism exceeds 60 ?
, the angle of emergence is such as would alone occasion the red rays to appear lowermost ; but , when the glass used is rectangular , the refraction at emergence has an opposite effect any reversion of colour will therefore be in some degree corrected , and may not be seen , unless the dispersive power of the medium in contact much exceeds that of the glass .
A case of refraction with an inverted order of colours , has been observed by Dr. BLAIR , * in a compound object-glass , where crown-glass was in contact with oil of turpentine .
From trials with lenses , he likewise inferred , that several other fluids have the same effect , when applied to that glass .
With this glass , and also with plate-glass , I have tried oil of turpentine , and many other fluids that afford a similar reversion of colours , as linseed-oil , olive-oil , the essential oils of bergamot , lemon , lavender , pennyroyal , and peppermint , strong nitric acid , and many artificial compounds that I shall presently have occasion to mention .
The dispersive power of fluor spar is the least of any substance yet examined ; so that , although its refractive power is also remarkably low , ( considering its great specific gravity , ) a prism of fluor , in contact with water or alcohol , shows the prismatic colours to be refracted in an inverted order .
With heavy spar , the instances of reversion are very-numerous , as its dispersive power is low , and is accompanied with ' Edinb .
Trans. Vol. IIL great refractive density .
In the refractions from this spar into flint glass , and into all oils or resins , I believe , without exception , the colours are seen reversed .
Rock crystal likewise disperses so little , that it exhibits the colours reversed , when it is in contact with many substances of less refractive power than itself .
I have tried it with Dutch plate-glass , with Canada balsam and balsam of capivi , with many oils essential and expressed , and have found the colours in all these cases reversed .
By solutions of metallic salts , a great variety of such appearances may be produced .
Most of these compounds have a highly dispersive power ; and many of them may be rendered sufficiently dense to occasion reversion , even when applied to flintglass .
In a more dilute state , they may be used with crownglass , or plate-glass , to produce the same effect .
And since , when further diluted by a less dispersive medium , they will also present an appearance of colourless refraction , we may , by examining the degree of dilution necessary for that purpose , compare the dispersive powers of any ingredients contained in them , and may gradually extend our knowledge of this property to the elements of any bodies , however compounded .
As a specimen of the method , I have in this way compared a few solutions of metals , and of other substances , that were each diluted till the limit of reflection appeared void of colour , when they were in contact with a rectangular piece of plate-glass ; and , in the table which follows , I have expressed their refractive powers in that state of dilution , as nearly as the eye can discern the disappearance of colour .

Of all these substances that I have yet tried , gold and platina are the most dispersive .
The least dispersive of the metals is zinc .
The earths also are found to possess this property in very different degrees : that of the jargon and magnesia differ but little from nitric acid in dispersive power ; but siliceous earth , on the contrary , is inferior to water .
By comparing the salts formed with the nitric and muriatic acids , it appeared probable that the former had the higher dispersive power ; but a more direct comparison could not be made by means of the rectangular piece of plate-glass , as muriatic acid could not be rendered sufficiently dense for such a trial ; I therefore made use of a triangular prism of crown-glass , which is in itself less dispersive than any plate-glass , and , from the relative position of its surfaces , occasioned less correction of the colours .
With this prism , I found that strong muriatic acid ( having a refractive power 1,394 ) exhibited the colours reversed ; and that , when it was diluted till the limit of reflection appeared void of colour , its refractive power was reduced to 1,382 .
But the dispersive power of nitric acid , when tried by the same prismt , proved to be greater ; for this acid required to be diluted till its refractive power did not exceed 1,375 , before the colour was wholly destroyed .
In the table it may be observed , that the red and green muriates of iron , though consisting of the same metal and acid , differ very much in dispersive power ; and , consequently , that some caution will be necessary , in attempting to compare the different metals with each other by means of the salts containing them , as any difference observed may be owing in part to a difference in the quantity of acid to which they are united , and in part to their different proportion of oxygen .
A striking instance of the latter is manifest , from a comparison of sulphur with the sulphuric acid ; for , while the former 376 appears to exceed the metallic oxides in dispersive power , the latter is inferior even to water .
As I have likewise , at various times , made many experiments on dispersion by means of wedges , in a manner nearly similar to that employed by Mr. DOLLOND , Dr. BLAIR , and others , I have endeavoured to reduce the several substances thus examined to one table ; but , as the limits of colour are in few instances sufficiently well defined for accurate mensuration , I have not attempted to add any numerical estimate of their powers , but have merely ascertained the order in which they succeed each other ; and , in the following table , have arranged them according to the excess of their effect on violet above red light , at a given angle of deviation , TABLE III .

I cannot conclude these observations on dispersion , without remarking that the colours into which a beam of white light is separable by refraction , appear to me to be neither 7 , as they usually are seen in the rainbow , nor reducible by any means ( that I can find ) to g , as some persons have conceived ; but that , by employing a very narrow pencil of light , 4 primary divisions of the prismatic spectrum may be seen , with a degree of distinctness that , I believe , has not been described nor observed before .
If a beam of day-light be admitted into a dark room by a crevice 2 of an inch broad , and received by the eye at the distance of o1 or 12 feet , through a prism of flint-glass , free from veins , held near the eye , the beam is seen to be separated into the four following colours only , red , yellowish green , blue , and violet ; in the proportions represented in Fig. 3 .
The line A that bounds the red side of the spectrum is somewhat confused , which seems in part owing to want of power in the eye to converge red light .
The line B , between red and green , in a certain position of the prism , is perfectly distinct ; so also are D and E , the two limits of violet .
But C , the limit of green and blue , is not so clearly marked as the rest ; and there are also , on each side of this limit , other distinct dark lines , f and g , either of which , in an imperfect experimaent , might be mistaken for the boundary of these colours .
The position of the prism in which the colours are most clearly divided , is when the incident light makes about equal angles with two of its sides .
I then found that the spaces AB , BC , CD , DE , occupied by them , were nearly as the numbers 16 , 23 , 36 , 25 .
Since the proportions of these colours to each other have been supposed by Dr. BLAIR to vary according to the medium by which they are produced , I have compared with this appearance , the coloured images caused by prismatic vessels containing substances supposed by him to differ most in this respect , such as strong but colourless nitric acid , rectified oil of turpentine , very pale oil of sassafras , and Canada balsam , also nearly colourless .
With each of these , I have found the same arrangement of these 4 colours , and , in similar positions of the prisms , as nearly as I could judge , the same proportions of them .
But , when the inclination of any prism is altered so as to increase the dispersion of the colours , the proportions of them to each other are then also changed , so that the spaces AC and CE , instead of being as before 39 and 61 , may be found altered as far as 4o and 58.* By candle-light , a different set of appearances may be distinguished .
When a very narrow line of the blue light at the lower part of the flame is examined alone , in the same manner , through a prism , the spectrum , instead of appearing a series of lights of different hues contiguous , may be seen divided into 5 images , at a distance from each other .
The ist is broad red , terminated by a bright line of yellow ; the 2d and 3d are both green ; the 4th and 5th are blue , the last of which appears to correspond with the division of blue and violet in the solar spectrum , or the line D of Fig. 3 .
When the object viewed is a blue line of electric light , I have found the spectrum to be also separated into several images ; but the phenomena are somewhat different from the preceding .
It is , however , needless to describe minutely , appearances which vary according to the brilliancy of the light , and which I cannot undertake to explain .
to the common prismatic spectrum , it is blackened more in the violet than in any other kind of light .
( ? ?

) In repeating this experiment , I found that the blackness extended-not only through the space occupied by the violet , but to an equal degree , and to about an equal distance , beyond the visible spectrum ; and that , by narrowing the pencil of light received on the prism , the discoloration may be made to fall almost entirely beyond the violet .
It would appear therefore , that this and other effects usually attributed to light , are not in fact owing to any of the rays usually peceived , but to invisible rays that accompany them ; and that , if we include two kinds that are invisible , we may distin .
