" On the Action of Chlorine upon Methyl .

In a paper published in the Journal of the Chemical Society , New Ser. vol. i. p. 425 , I pointed out the great interest which attached to the study of the lower terms of hydrocarbons , known by the name of the " alcohol radicals , " inasmuch as the question of the chemical constitution of these bodies requires to be more definitely settled .
Having been aided in these researches by a grant from the Council , I beg to lay before the Royal Society the results of an investigation on the action of chlorine upon methyl , which are as unexpected as they are decisive .
Equal volumes of chlorine and of methyl were exposed in strong wellcorked bottles , holding from two to three litres , to diffused daylight in the open air at a temperature of about 50 C. The methyl was prepared according to Kolbe 's method , by electrolysis of a concentrated solution of acetate of potassium , and carefully purified by washing with a solution of caustic potash and concentrated sulphuric acid .
The colour of the chlorine disappeared rather quickly ; colourless oily drops condensed on the the sides of the bottles , and collected after some time on the bottom as a mobile liquid , the greater part of which volatilized again when the bottles were brought into a warm room .
Hence it appears that by the action of one volume of chlorine upon one of methyl , substitution-products are formed , consisting chiefly of a volatile liquid , the boiling-point of which ies between 5 ?
and 15 ?
C. In order to collect these products , the bottles were heated till all the liquid had volatilized , and then opened , with the mouth downwards , unider a hot concentrated solution of common salt , to which some caustic soda was added in order to quicken the absorption of the hydrochloric acid , of which half the volume of gas contained in the bottles consisted .
The bottles were then taken out of the liquid , placed in an upright position , and the mouth provided with a doubly perforated cork , into one opening of which a siphon fitted .
Through this siphon a hot concentrated solution of common salt slowly ran in , whilst the gas thus displaced escaped by a bent tuibe and was condensed in a small tube receiver , sturrounded by a mixture of ice and salt .
The liquid thus obtained was left for some hours in contact with a piece of solid caustic potash , in order to remove moisture and the last traces of hydrochloric acid .
Subjected to distillation , the liquid began to boil at 110 C. , and the boiling-point rose slowly to 30 ?
C. , at which temperature two-thirds of the liquid had come over .
On continuing the fractional distillation for some time longer , the distillate yielded a few grammes of a colourless mobile liquid , boiling between 11 ?
and 130 C. , which , as the following analysis and vapour-density determinations prove , is chloride of ethyl , C2 H5 Cl. The boiling-point of the liquid agrees with that of this compound , and it possesses the strong peculiar smell and the property of burning with a white , luminous , green-bordered flame , characteristic of the chloride of ethyl .

The boiling-point of the residue left after the first distillation rose quickly up to 60 ?
C. , whilst nearly the whole distilled over between this temperature and 70 ?
C. By a few more fractionial distillations of this latter portion , monochlorinated chloride of ethyl , 02 114 Cl2 , boiling between 620 and 65 ' C. , was isolated .
0 1270 grin .
of this compouind gave 0 3530 grm. of chloride of silver and 0 0095 grm. of metallic silver , which corresponds to 7143 per cent. of chlorine , whilst the formula requires 71 71 per cent. Eight litres of methyl yielded about 8 grammes of the mixed chlorides , or only about one-third of the theoretical quantity of chloride of ethyl which should have been obtained .
This is easily explained by the volatilization of the liquid , and its solution in large quantities of water , as well as by the formationi of higher substitution-products , in consequence of which a considerable quantity of methyl is left uncombined .
From these results it appears that the lowest term of the series of alcolhol radicals behaves with chlorine exactly in the same manner as I have shown in the paper above referred to is the case with its homologues ethyl-amyl , C7 H12 ( which gives chloride of heptyl , 07 TI ; Cl ) , and amyl , CIO H22 ( from which chloride of decatyl , CIO HI2 Cl , is obtained ) .
If an excess of chlorine is avoided , the principal products consist of the chlorides of monatomic radicals containing the same number of atoms of carbon as the original hydrocarbon contained , whilst at the same time chlorine substitution-products of these chlorides are formed in smaller quantities .
As there is , no reason why those terms of the series which are placed between C2 I-6 , C7 1G , C0 1122 should show a different deportment , it becomes obvious that , beginning with marsh-gas , C II4 , the lowest term in the series C0zH21n+2 , the most simple of all hydrocarbons , and onie which can easily be obtained from its elements , we are now not only in a position to prepare all the members of this series , but likewise to build up by simple sylnthesis the series of mono- , di- , and polyatomic alcohols , acids , compound ammonias , ethers , &amp;c. &amp;c. of which each of the marslh-gas bydrocarbolns forms the starting-point .
