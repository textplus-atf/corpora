" C On some Elementary Principles in Animal Mechanics .
" By the Rev. SAMUEL HAUGHTON , M.D. , Fellow of Trinity College , Dublin .
Received May 15 , 1867 .
There are some elementary principles in animal mechanics which are so natural that they may be assumed as probable , and as such , have not received from observers the attention they really deserve .
Among these principles I select for illustration the two following:.i .
The force of a muscle is proportional to the area of its cross section .
ii .
The force of a muscle is proportional to the cross section of the tendon that conveys its inftuence to a distant point .
i. In order to test the first of these statements , I made a careful examination of the cross sections of the muscles that bend the fore arm and leg , in a very finely developed male subject , with the following results : Neglecting the slight effect of the Sipinator radii longus in flexing the fore arm , I found the cross sections of the Biceps tzumeri and Brachiwus to be as follows : Cross section .

107 Hence if K denote the force of the muscle , per square inch of cross section , we have , adding 2lbs .
for the weight of the fore arm at 12 ?
inches from the axis of the joint , 41 lbs. x 12,1 inches=K x +1291 x '06 5021.=K x { +1 }'36 4{+1s36 } =Ix 5304 and finally KT= 94-7 lbs. This represents the force per square inch of cross section that the muscles flexing the fore arm are capable of exerting .
In order to measure the force of the muscles flexing the leg , I placed the observer lying upon his face upon a table , with the legs extended over its edge , and having fastened down the thighs , I observed the maximum weights , suspended from the heel that could be conveniently lifted , and found that 34 lbs. was the limit ; to this must be added 3 lbs. for the weight of the leg , supposed suspended at the heel , which was measured as 16-a inches from the axis of rotation of the knee-joint .
The perpendiculars let fall upon the directions of the several muscles flexing the leg were then measured : Perpendicular 1 .

1104 These numbers are , perhaps , as near to each other as this class of observations admits of , but I believe that they do not differ so much , really , as they appear to do , for the following reason : As it was not convenient to procure a good subject destroyed by a violent death , I made use of a powerful man who had died of cholera * , and who had been a blacksmith by profession .
Now , it is natural to suppose that the muscles of the arm of a blacksmith are more developed than those of his leg , so that their cross section would be relatively too great , and the coefficient derived from that cross section , therefore , too small .
I therefore compared the sections of the Biceps hzcneri and Brachicws , found by me , with the only other measurements , with which I am acquainted , for the knowledge of which I am indebted to Dr. W. Moore of Dublin , who translated the results for me , from the Dutch , of M1essrs .

614 0952 1596 2 474 If this estimate of the cross section of the muscles be assumed instead of my own , the coefficient found by me should be increased in the proportion of 3190 to 2474 ; or Coefficient of muscles of fore arm ... 94'7 x 2=122 lbs. The mean of the coefficients found from my own measurement of the muscles of the arm , and that of Professor Donders , is 1084 lbs. , which agrees nearly with that obtained from the muscles of the leg , viz. 110'4 lbs. , and the mean of all the observations on arm and leg would be 109*4 lbs. , a result which I consider to be not far from the truth .
The cross sections of the muscles were found by cutting them across with a sharp scalpel , and marking out their section on cardboard , and afterwards weighing the marked portions , the weights of which were then compared with the weight of a known number of square inches of the same cardboard , and so the cross sections in square inches calculated .
I give here , for the purpose of illustration , the actual sections of the muscles of the leg .
( Figs. 1-6 .
) The perpendiculars let fall upon the directions of the muscles were measured by stretching strings from the origin to the inisertion of the muscles , and measuring , by means of a compass , the perpendiculars let fall upon these strings from the axis of the joint .
The weights of the muscles themselves were as follows:oz .

The principle of economy of force or of material in nature would lead necessarily to the principle that each tendon conveying the effect of a force to a distant point should have the exact strength required , and neither more nor less ; for , according to the doctrine of final causes , it was originally contrived by a perfect architect , and according to La* Over de Elasticiteit der Spieren .

marckian views it must have perfectly accommodated itself to the uses to which it is applied .
According , therefore , to either view , if the tendon be too strong , it will become atrophied down to the proper limit ; Fig. 1 .

and if too weak , it must either break , or be nourished up to the requisite degree of strength .
It seemed to me desirable to prove this fundamental proposition in animal mechanics by direct observation ; and I selected for this purpose the tendons in the leg of several of the large running birds ( Struthionidc ) ; and always with the same result , viz. , 1867 .
] 23 that the cross sections of any two muscles tending to produce a similar efect are directly proportional to the cross sections of their tendons .
I shall select as an example the case of the flexor iiallzucis longus and flexor digitoroum cozmmunzis peforans of the Rhea , whose tendons unite into a common tendon halfway down the posterior side of the canneon bone of the bird .
The cross sections of these two muscles are shown in the annexed figures , taken as in the human subject .
( Figs. 7 and 8 .
) The areas of these cross sections were found to be as 245 to 160 ; or the lesser was 65 per cent. of the greater .
Two equal lengths of the dried tendons were then weighed and found to be in the proportion of 845 to 495 , which was assumed to be the proportion of their cross sections .
The lesser of these numbers is 59 per cent. of the greater ; a result that seems to be as near to the former result derived from the muscles , as can be expected in this class of experiments .
