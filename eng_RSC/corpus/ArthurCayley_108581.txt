Second -Memoir upon Quantics .
By ARTHUR CAYLEY , Esq. Received April 14 , -Read May 24 , 1855 .
THE present mnemoir is intended as a continuation of my Introductory Memoir upon Quantics , t. 144 .
( 1854 ) p. 245 , and must be read in connexion with it ; the paragraphs of the two Memoirs are numbered continuously .
The special subject of the present memoir is the theorem referred to in the Postscript to the Introductory Memnoir , and the various developments arising thereout in relation to the number and form of the covariants of a binary quantic .
25 .
1 have already spoken of asyzygetic covariants and invariants , and I shall have occasion to speak of irreducible covariants and invariants .
Considering in general a function u determined like a covariant or invariant by means of a system of partial differential equations , it will be convenient to explain what is meant by an asyzygetic integral and by an irreducible integral .
Attending for greater simplicity only to a single set ( a , b , c ... ) , which in the case of the covariants or invariants of a single function will be as before the coefficients or elements of the function , it is assumed that the system admits of integrals of the form u=_P , u=Q , &amp;c. , or as we may express it , of integrals P , Q , &amp;c. , where P , Q , &amp;c. are rational and integral homogeneous functions of the set ( a , b , c. .
) , and moreover that the systemr is such that P , Q , &amp;c. being integrals , P(P , Q. .
) is also an integral .
Then considering only the integrals which are rational and integral homogeneous functions of the set ( a , b , c. .
) , integrals P , Q , R,. .
not connected by any linear equation or syzygy ( such as XP+PQ+vR..=O* ) , are said to be asyzygetic ; but in speaking of the asyzygetic integrals of a particular degree , it is implied that the integirals are a system such that every other integral of the same degree can be expressed as a linear function ( such as xP+pQ+vR. .
) of these integrals ; and any integral P not expressible as a rational and integral hlomogeneous function of integrals of inferior degrees is said to be an irreducible integral .
26 .
Suppose now that A , , A , , &amp;c. denote the number of asyzygetic integrals of the degrees 1 , 2 , 3 , &amp;c. respectively , and let a , , c , , , , &amp;c. be determined by the equations I A1A2=2Ioc(a , + 1 ) +M2 A3= G6Cl(al+l)(la1+2 ) + 1V'2+ 3 A4= , ( oa , + 1)(ga+-2)(ag+3a)+1o(o+1l)21-3+ 3+ 2(2+ 1)+s4 , &amp;c. , or what is the same thing , suppose that I +A , x+A , x2+ &amp;c. = ( 1 -x-)-a'(1l 2)-a2(l --x3)3 ... A little consideration will show that a , represents the number of irreducible integrals of the degree r less the number of linear relations or syzygies between the composite or non-irreducible integrals of the same degree .
In fact the asyzygetic integrals of the degree 1 are necessarily irreducible , i. e. A=--O , .
Represent for a moment the irreducible integrals of the degree 1 by X , X ' , &amp;c. , then the composite integrals X2 , XX ' , &amp;c. , the number of which is Ic1 , ( , + 1 ) , must be included among the asyzygetic integrals of the degree 2 ; and if the composite integrals in question were asyzygetic , there would remain A2-a , ( M , + l ) for the number of irreducible integrals of the degree 2 ; but if there exist syzygies between the composite integrals in question , the number to be subtracted from A2 will be cV , ( l-+1 ) less the number of these syzygies , and we shall have A2--1 , ( c,1+ ) , i. e. a2 equal to the number of the irreducible integrals of the degree 2 less the number of syzygies between the composite integrals of the same degree .
Again , suppose that a , is negative -13 , we may for simplicity fuppose that there are no irreducible integrals of the degree 2 , but that the composite integrals of this degree , X2 , XX ' , &amp;c. , are connected by 12 syzygies , such as ; X2+-XX'+ &amp;c. -=0 , 1XX2+- , XX'+ &amp;c. =0 .
The asyzygetic integrals of the degree 4 include X4 , X ' X ' , &amp;c. , the number of which is 24 ( c+1 )(a , +2)(a , +3 ) ; but these composite integrals are not asyzygetic , they are connected by syzygies which are augumentatives of the 2 syzygies of the second degree , viz. by syzygies such as ( 7X2+pXX'..)X2=0 , ( lJX2+XX'.)XX ')XX &amp;c. ( X , X2+plXX'..)X2=O , ( X ?
X2+(,1XX'..)XX'O , &amp;c. , the number of which is a , ( al , +1)P2 .
And these syzygies are themselves not asyzygetic , they are connected by secondary syzygies such as x , ( X2+ cxXX'..)X2+1 , ( XX2+x(XX'..)XX'+ &amp;c. -_(.lX 2+i , iXX'..)X2"p(X , X2+JLXX'..)XX'- &amp;c. -=O , &amp;c. &amp;c. , the number of which is 132(P2-1 ) .
The real number of syzygies between the composite integrals X4 , X3X ' , &amp;c. ( i. e. of the syzygies arising out of the P2 syzygies 11 between X2 , XX ' , &amp;c. ) , is therefore l(a , +-1)22P2(32--1 ) , and the number of integrals of the degree 4 , arising out of the integrals and syzygies of the degrees 1 and 2 respectively , is therefore 1 2 ) I , ,-i(a , + 1)(al+2 ) ( a+3)-al(al+ ')P2-+ ( P2-_ ) ; 102 or writing --C instead of / , the number in question is 4c(a1+ 1)(i+ 2 ) ( , + 3 ) +2 I1(1 + 1)a2+ 22(2+ 1 ) .
The integrals of the degrees 1 and 3 give rise to a , a integrals of the degree 4 ; and if all the composite integrals obtained as above were asyzygetic , we should have A424(oa +)( , +2)( , + 3)Ma(a + 1)~2a2(2+ 1)--~a , I i. e. Oc4 as the number of irreducible integrals of the degree 4 ; but if there exist any further syzygies between the composite integrals , then a , will be the number of the irreducible integrals of the degree 4 less the number of such further syzygies , and the like reasoning is in all cases applicable .
27 .
It maybe remarked , that for any given partial differential equation , or system of such equations , there will be always a finite number v such that given v independent integrals every other integral is a function ( in general an irrational function only expressible as the root of an equation ) of the v independent integrals ; and if to these integrals we join a single other integral not a rational function of the v integrals , it is easy to see that every other integral will be a rational function of the +1 integrals ; but every such other integral will not in general be a rational and integral function of the v+ 1 integrals ; and there is not in general any finite number whatever of integrals , such that every other integral is a rational and integral function of these integrals , i. e. the number of irreducible integrals is in general infinite ; and it would seem that this is in fact the case in the theory of covariants .
28 .
In the case of the covariants , or the invariants of a binary quantic , A2 is given ( this will appear in the sequel ) as the coefficient of Xn in the development , in ascending powers of x , of a rational fraction , wherefx is of the form ( 1 -x)l( 1 2)2 .
( ] -xk)k and the degree of px is less than that offx .
We have therefore 1+A , x+A22 +. .
=f and consequently x-= -(1-x)"1-l(l -x2)2-La2. .
( l Xk)k-ak(1 Xk+l)-ak+l. .
Now every rational factor of a binomial I--xm is the irreducible factor of Il--m ' , where m ' is equal to or a submultiple of m. Hence in order that the series oa , a2 , G3. .
may terminate , 'px must be made up of factors each of which is the irreducible factor of a binomial 1--xm , or if px be itself irreducible , then px must be the irreducible factor of a binomial x. Conversely , if 'px be not of the form in question , the series C , , , C3 , &amp;c. will go on ad infinitum , and it is easy to see that there is no point in the series such that the terms beyond that point are all of them negative , i. e. there will be irreducible covariants or invariants of indefinitely high degrees ; and the 103 number of covariants or invariants will be infinite .
The number of invariants is first infinite in the case of a quantic of the seventh order , or septic ; the number of covariants is first infinite in the case of a quantic of the fifth order , or quintic .
29 .
Resuming the theory of binary quantics , I consider the quantic ( a , b,. .
, a'Jx , y)Y .
Here writing { ybx } =a6b+2bbb. .
+mb'a'=X { xay } =mbb+-m-lca^. .
+a'b , ^ Y , { X-ai aM any function which is reduced to zero by each of the operations X-y , )x Y-x6y is a covariant of the quantic .
But a covariant will always be considered as a rational and integral function separately homogeneous in regard to the facients ( x , y ) and to the coefficients ( a , b,. .
b ' , a ' ) .
And the words order and degree will be taken to refer to the facients and to the coefficients respectively .
I commence by proving the theorem enunciated , No. 23 .
It follows at once from the definition , that the covariant is reduced to zero by the operation X--Yx .
YxayY Yxa , y.x -ya- , which is equivalent to X.Y-Y.X+yay-x .
Now X.Y=XY+X(Y ) Y. X=YX+Y(X ) , where XY and YX are equivalent operations , and X(Y)= 1lmada+2m-1 bab ... +-m 1 b'a Y(X)= m bb,. .
+2m--1 hb ' + lma ' , whence X ( Y)Y(X ) =mab+-+m--2bab.-2b'm,.-ma'a , =k suppose , and the covariant is therefore reduced to zero by the operation k+-yb , --xb , .
Now as regards a term a"b..b'a ' ?
'.xiy ' , we have k-=ma+m-23. .
, --mn-2\--m yZ , -Xa , a=j-i ; and we see at once that for each term of the covariant we must have ma+m-2 --..-m-23P\'m--m=j-=O , i. e. if ( x , y ) are considered as being of the weights , -respectively , and ( a , b , b , a ' ) as being of the weights --2 m , -2 m+ 1,. .
' m1 , m respectively , then the weight of each term of the covariant is zero .
104 But if ( x , y ) are considered as being of the weights 1 , 0 respectively , and ( a , b,..b ' , a ' ) as being of the weights 0 , ,..m-1- , m respectively , then writing the equation under the form m(a+ pi. .
+ 3'+a)+j+i-2(3+. .
+m13'+m ' +i)=0 , and supposing that the covariant is of the order p and of the degree 0 , each term of the covariant will.be of the weight , ( mO+p ) .
I shall in the sequel consider the weight as reckoned in the last-mentioned manner .
It is convenient to remark , that as regards any function of the coefficients of the degree 0 and of the weight q , we have X.Y-Y.X=m--2q .
30 .
Consider now a covariant ( A , B,..B ' , A ' x , y ) .
of the order p and of the degree 0 ; the covariant is reduced to zero by each of the operations X-yb , , Y--x , , and we are thus led to the systems of equations XA=0 XB =pA XC =p-1B XB'=2C ' XA'=--B and YA =B YB=2C YC'=-B ' YB ' =pA ' YA ' =0 .
Conversely if these equations are satisfied the function will be a covariant .
I assume that A is a function of the degree 0 and of the weight 2 ( mO-p ) , satisfying the condition XA=0 .
And I represent by YA , Y2A , Y3A , &amp;c. the results obtained by successive operations with Y upon the function A. The function Y'A will be of the degree 0 and of the weight 2 ( m0--)+s .
And it is clear that in the series of terms YA , Y2A , Y3A , &amp;c. , we must at last come to a term which is equal to zero .
In fact , since m is the greatest weight of any coefficient , the weight of YV is at most equal to mO , and therefore if ( mr--I)+s &gt; mo , or s &gt; ( m0+z ) , we must have Y'A=O .
2.2 P)rM r. ~O\ M 105 Now writing for greater simplicity XY instead of X.Y , and so in similar cases , we have , as regards YVA , XY-YX=p -2s .
Hence ( XY-YX)A=--A , and consequently XYA =YXA+ / A=pA .
Similarly ( XY-YX)YA= --2YA , and therefore XY2A=YXYA +-2YA =-YA+E-2YA=2(p1)YA .
And again , ( XY-YX)Y2A=p--4Y2A , and therefore XY3A=YXY2A + 4Y2A =2p-Y2A+4---4Y2A=3(/ p-2)Y2A , or generally XY'A=s(--s+ 1)YsA .
Hence putting s=p+-l , +2 , &amp;c. , we have XY +1A=o XY'+2AA= ( +2 ) 1.Y+IA XY'+3A= -(= +3)2.Y ' +2A &amp;c. , equations which show that Y+'A=O0 ; for unless this be so , i. e. if Y"+lA=1=0 , then from the second equation XY+2A=O=0 , and therefore Y+2A=I=O , from the third equation XY'+I=0O , and therefore Y+'A=I=O , and so on ad infinitum , i. e. we must have Y+'A=0 .
31 .
The suppositions which have been made as to the function A , give therefore the equations XA=0 XYA=pA XY2A=2(p1)YA XY"A=pY-'A Yg+'A=0 .
And if we now assume B=YA , C=-YB,..A'=YB , 2 the system becomes XA =-0 XB =pA XC =-B XA'=B ' YA'=0 ; so that the entire systern of equations which express that ( A , B..B ' , A'Jx , y ) is a covariant is satisfied ; hence Theorem .
Given a quantic ( a , b,. .
b ' , ax , y ) ; if A be a function of the coefficients of the degree 6 and of the weight 2 ( m6d- ) satisfying the condition XA=O , and if B , C,..B ' , A ' are determined by the equations 1 B-YA , C=YB,..A=YB ' , then will ( A , B,..B ' , A'x , y ) be a covariant .
In particular , a function A of the degree a and of the weight X md , satisfying the condition XA=O , will ( also satisfy the equation YA=O and will ) be an invariant .
32 .
1 take now for A the most general function of the coefficients , of the degree d and of the weight I ( mD-b ) then XA is a function of the degree 6 and of the weight 3 ( m0- ) )1 , and the arbitrary coefficients in the function A are to be determined so that XA=O .
The number of arbitrary coefficients is equal to the number of terms in A , and the number of the equations to be satisfied is equal to the number of terms in XA ; hence the number of the arbitrary coefficients which remains indeterminate is equal to the number of terms in A less the number of terms in XA ; and since the covariant is completely determined when the leading coefficient is known , the difference in question is equal to the number of the asyzygetic covariants , i. e. the number of the asyzygetic covariants of the order p and the degree 0 is equal to the number of terms of the degree 6 and weight 2 ( mO-p ) , less the number of terms of the degree d and weight ( m6-P)1 .
33 .
I shall now give some instances of the calculation of covariants by the method just explained .
It is very convenient for this purpose to commence by forming the literal parts by ARBOGAST'S Method of Derivations : we thus form tables such as the following:a 6b c a2 ab ac bc b2 b2 i~ ' ?
~ - ] be 107 a |b |c d a2 ab a ad bd cd d 62 e c2 a3 a2b a2c a2d abd acd ad2 bd2 cd2 d ab2 abe ac2 b2d bed c2d ' b3 b62 b62 c3 a4 a3b a3c a 'd a2bd a2cd a2d2 abd2 acd2 ad3 bd3 cd3 d4 a2b2 ' a2bc a"c2 e a62d abed ac2d b2d2 bed2 c2d2 ab3 ab2c abc2 ac3 b2cd becd cad b4 b63 b3d be3 c4 b2c2 a6cde a2 ab ac ad ae be bd cd d2 b2 be bd cd C2 C2 ?
a2e abe ace ade ae2 abd acd .
ad2 bee bde ac2 62d 62e bd2 c2e b2c be2 bed c2d cd2 c3 34 .
Thus in the case of a cubic ( a , b , c , d3x , y)3 , the tables show that there will be a single invariant of the degree 4 .
Represent this by Aa2d2 +Babcd + Cac +Db3d +Eb2c2 , which is to be operated upon with a ?
b+2b^3c+3cd .
This gives +B +3D +2E + 2B +6C +4E +6A + 3B +3D a2cd ab2d abc2 6b3 108 i. e. B+6A=0 , 3D+2B=0 , &amp;c. ; or putting A=I , we find B=-6 , C=4 , D=4 , E=--3 , and the invariant is a2d2 -6abcd +4ac3 4h3d --3b2 .
Again , there is a covariant of the order 3 and the degree 3 .
or leading coefficient is Aa2d -Babe +Cb3 , The coefficient of xs which operated upon with aaB+2b-b+3ca , gives '+{B ||+ 3A aec 3C +2B a62 i. e. B+3A=0 , 3C+2B0 ; or putting A=1 , we have B=--3 , C=2 , and the leading coefficient is a2d -3abc +2b3 .
The coefficient of xy is found by operating upon this with ( 3bba+2cb-+dd c ) , this gives +6 -9 -6 + -l~ i. e. the required coefficient of x2y is -3 abd ae b2c 3abd --6ac2 and by operating upon this with ( 3b6b+2c6+dac)9 , we have for the coefficient of xl:y2 +3 -6 acd +9 ' +i 62d -9 ~ +6 be i. e. the coefficient of xy2 is MDCCCLVI .
3acd.+ 6b2d.-3bc2 .
Q 109 Finally , operating upon this with I ( 3b0a+2ca^+d ) , , we have for the coefficient of y -1 ads -3 +8 -bed -2 ' ca i. e. the coefficient of y3 is -ad " +3bcd -2c3 , and the covariant is a2d 3abd -3acd -ad2 ( -3abc --6ae +662d +3bed )+ 263 -+ 3be -36c2 -2c3 I have worked out the example in detail as a specimen of the most convenient method for the actual calculation of more complicated covariants * .
35 .
The number of terms of the degree 0 and of the weight q is obviously equal to the number of ways in which q can be made up as a sum of 0 terms with the elements ( 0 , I , 2 , ... m ) , a number which is equal to the coefficient of xqze in the development of 1 ( 1l-z ) ( 1 -Xz ) ( 1-'xz)..(1--QGr ' ) ; and the number of the asyzygetic covariants of any particular degree for the quantic * Note added Feb. 7 , 1856.--The following method for the calculation of an invariant or of the leading coefficient of a covariant , is easily seen to be identical in principle with that given in the text .
Write down all the terms of the weight next inferior to that of the invariant or leading coefficient , and operate on each of these separately with the symbol bc bind .
b*+2 ind .
c ( *jx , y)m can therefore be determined by means of this development .
In the case of a cubic , for example , the function to be developed is 1 ( l-z ) ( I z)(l-)( A SZ3 ) which is equal to 1+z-(l +x+x2+x)+z2(1 +x+2x-+24X+2x4+.x5+x6)+ &amp;c. , where the coefficients are given by the following table ; on account of the symmetry , the series of coefficients for each power of z is continued only to the middle term or middle of the series .
1l f ( 0 ) 11 12 f2 f(2 ) / 1if f 13 f ( 3 ) I'f1 'I ? ?
1 f3 / f4 fsf 6 6j/ ( 5 ) 1 f1 2 *3s 4 ? ?
51 7 fs fS ( 6 ) and from this , by subtracting from each precedes it , we form the table coefficient the coefficient which immediately 1 ( 0 ) I1 0 ( 1 ) 101o ( 2 ) 10110 ( 3 ) I o0 1110o1 ( 4 ) O1 11 11 o1 o ( 5 ) 1011112 0o 1 0o ( 6 The successive lines fix the numberi and chlaracter of the covariants of the degrees 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , &amp;c. The line ( 0 ) , if this were to be interpreted , would show that there is a single covariant of the degree 0 ; this covariant is of course merely the absolute con-stant unity , and may be excluded .
The line ( ) shows that there is a single covariant Q2 1.11. .
of the degree 1 , viz. a covariant of the order 3 ; this is the cubic itself , which I represent by U. The line ( 2 ) shows that there are two asyzygetic covariants of the degree 2 , viz. one of the order 6 , this is merely U'2 , and one of the order 2 , this I represent by H. The line ( 3 ) shows that there are three asyzygetic covariants of the degree 3 , viz. one of the order 9 , this is U3 ; one of the order 5 , this is UH , and one of the order 3 , this I represent by O( .
The line ( 4 ) shows that there are five asyzygetic covariants of the degree 4 , viz. one of the order 12 , this is U4 ; one of the order 8 , this is U2H ; one of the order 6 , this is H2 ; and one of the order 0 , i. e. an invariant , this I represent by V. The line ( 5 ) shows that there are six asyzygetic covariants of the degree 5 , viz. one of the order 15 , this is U5 ; one of the order 11 , thisis isUH ; one of the order 9 , this is UJ2P ; one of the order 7 , this is UH2 ; one of the order 5 , this is HI- ; and one of the order 3 , this is VU .
The line ( 6 ) shows that there are 8 asyzygetic covariants of the degree 6 , viz. one of the order 18 , this is U6 ; one of the order 14 , this is U4H ; one of the order 12 , this is U3(P ; one of the order 10 , this is U2'-12 ; one of the order 8 , this is UH'P ; two of the order 6 ( i. e. the three covariants H3 , P'2 and VU ' are not asyzygetic , but are connected by a single linear equation or syzygy ) , and one of the order 2 , this is VH .
We are thus led to the irreducible covariants U , HE , ( , V connected by a linear equation or syzygy between H3 , ( D2 and VU2 , and this is in fact the complete system of irreducible covariants ; V is therefore the only invariant .
36 .
The asyzygetic covariants are of the form UWHqV ' , or else of the form UWHV''O ; and since U , H , V are of the degrees 1 , 2 , 4 respectively , and ( P is of the degree 3 , the number of asyzygetic covariants of the degree m of the first form is equal to the coefficient of x in 1(1-x)(1-x2)(1-x4 ) , and the number of the asyzygetic covariants of the degree m of the second form is equal to the coefficient of xn in x'-(1 -x)(l1-..)(1 --4 ) .
Hence the total number of asyzygetic covariants is eqtal to the coefficient of xm in ( 1-x3)-(l1-x)(Il-x2)(1-X4 ) , or what is the same thing , in 1 -x6 ( 1- ) ( 1-2 ) ( 1-3 ) ( 1--4 ) ; and conversely , if this expression for the number of the asyzygetic covariants of the degree m were established independently , it would follow that the irreducible invariants were four in number , and of the degrees 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 respectively , but connected by an equation of the degree 6 .
As regards the invariants , every invariant is of the form UP , i. e. the number of asyzygetic invariants of the degree m is equal to the coefficient of xm in _x4 , and conversely , from this expression it would follow that there was a single irreducible invariant of the degree 4 .
37 .
In the case of a quartic , the function to be developed is , 1 ( 1 z)(1 xz)(1 xz)(1 3 ) ( 1 x4(1 ) 112 and the coefficients are given by the table .
25811i11123 And subtracting from each have the table2 1361259136 10 1359 13 14 247 11 1147 11 358 12 16 16 18 ( 0 ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) coefficient the coefficient immediately preceding it , we 1111010112011122010 1 .
1122I0000101111101 112 13131202 ( 0 ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) the examination of which will show that we have for the quartic the following irreducible covariants , viz. the quartic itself U ; an invariant of the degree 2 , which I represent by I ; a covariant of the order 4 and of the degree 2 , which I represent by H ; an invariant of the degree 3 , which I represent by J ; and a covariant of the order 6 and the degree 3 , which I represent by L( ; but that the irreducible covariants are connected by an equation of the degree 6 , viz. there is a linear equation or syzygy between ( )2 , I3H3 , 12JIJ12U , IJ2HU2 and J3U3 ; this is in fact the complete system of the irreducible covariants of the quartic : the only irreducible invariants are the invariants I , J. 38 .
The asyzygetic covariants are of the form UPIqHWJ , or else of the form UPlqHrJsqD , and the number of the asyzygetic covariants of the degree r is equal to the coefficient of xm in ( 1+-x ) --(1-x)( 1-x ) ( --x3 ) ) or what is the same thing , in 1 --6 113 2 ( 1 X ) 1 X)2(1 c ) !
z and the asyzygetic invariants are of the form IPJ , and the number of the asyzygetic invariants of the degree m is equal to the coefficient of xm in 1 +(1--x2)(1 --x ) .
Conversely , if these formulae were established , the preceding results as to the form of the system of the irreducible covariants or of the irreducible invariants , would follow .
39 .
In the case of a quintic , the function to be developed is ( 1 z)(1 -XZ ) ( 1 -2Z- ) ( 1-Z ) ( 1-X4z)(l -x5Z ) ; and the coefficients are given by the table : I ( 0 ) Llr ( ?
) i1 12 213 3 ( 2 ) 1123456 16 ( 3 ) 11235689 11)11 12 ( 4 ) 1235911 14 16 18 19 20 ( 5 ) and subtracting from each coefficient the one which immediately precedes it , we have the table : 100 ( 1 ) 101 IO I0 ( 2 ) 110 111110 ( 3 ) 1o11 21112 112 0 11 ( 4 ) 01 Illl 222232211 ( 5 ) We thus obtain the following irreducible covariants , viz. Of the degree 1 ; a single covariant of the order 5 , this is the quintic itself .
Of the degree 2 ; two covariants , viz. one of the order 6 , and one of the order 2 .
Ofthe degree 3 ; three covariants , viz. one of the order 9 , one of the order 5 , and one of the order 3 .
Of the degree 4 ; three covariants , viz. one of the order 6 , one of the order 4 , and one of the order 0 ( an invariant ) .
Of the degree 5 ; three covariants , viz. one of the order 7 , one of the order 3 , and one of the order 1 ( a linear covariant ) .
114 And these covariants are connected by a single syzygy of the degree 5 and of the order 11 ; in fact , the table shows that there are only two asyzygetic covariants of this degree and order ; but we may , with the above-mentioned irreducible covariants of the degrees 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 , form three covariants of the degree 5 and the order 11 ; there is therefore a syzygy of this degree and order .

I represent the number of ways in which q can be made up as a sum of m terms with the elements 0 , 1 , 2 , ... m , each element being repeatable an indefinite number of times by the notation P(0 , 1 , 2,. .
m)q , and I write for shortness P'(O , 1,2,..m)0q=P(O , 1,2..m)0q-P(0 , 1,2 ... m)0q-l .
Then for a quantic of the order m , the number of asyzygetic covariants of the degree 0 and of the order p is'( , 1,2 ... ( d ) PIt(O , 1 , 2 ... m)01(m--a ) .
In particular , the number of asyzygetic invariants of the degree 0 is P'(O , 1 , 2. .

To find the total number of the asyzygetic covariants of the degree 0 , suppose first that md is even ; then , giving to p the successive values 0 , 2 , 4,. .
m , the required number is P(ImO ) -P(lm1 ) +P(mdO-l1)-P(mO-d-2 ) +P(2 ) -P(1 ) +P(1 ) -=P(}mO ) , i. e. when md is even , the number of the asyzygetic covariants of the degree 0 is P(O , 1 , 2. .

But the two formulae may be united into a single formula ; for when mO is odd sm0 is a fraction , and therefore P( ?

Attending first to the invariants,42 .
For a quadric , the number of asyzygetic invariants of the degree 0 is coefficient xo in 1-2which leads to the conclusion that there is a single irreducible invariant of the degree 2 .
116 For a cubic , the number of asyzygetic invariants of the degree 0 is coefficient x9 in 1-_-4 i. e. there is a single irreducible invariant of the degree 4 .
44 .
For a quartic , the number of asyzygetic invariants of the degree 0 is coefficient x8 in ( l _XZ)(i _3 ) i. e. there are two irreducible invariants of the degrees 2 and 3 respectively .
45 .
For a quintic , the number of asyzygetic invariants of the degree 0 is _--X6 + x12 coefficient x ?
in ( _x4)(,6 The numerator is the irreducible factor of 1--x36 , i.e. it is equal to ( 1-x36)(1--x6 ) -(1--x18)(1--x'2 ) ; and substituting this value , the number becomes 1--X36 coefficient x ' in ( 1_4)(-8)(1 i)(1_I8 ) i. e , there are in all four irreducible invariants , which are of the degrees 4 , 8 , 12 and 18 respectively ; but these are connected by an equation of the degree 36 , i. e. the square of the invariant of the degree 18 is a rational and integral function of the other three invariants ; a result , the discovery of which is due to M. HERMIT .
46 .
For a sextic , the number of asyzygetic invariants of the degree 0 is * ( 1 -)(l( +X X4-X5 7+ X+X8 ) coefficient x in ( 1 _-2)(1 -x -4)(1-5 ) the second factor of the numerator is the irreducible factor of 1--x30 , i e. it is equal to ( 1 -3 ?
)(l--5)(1-3)(1 -2 ) +(1--15)(1-~ ?
l)(1-l6)(1 - ) ; andsubstitutingthis value , the number becomes 1 --xs ?
coefficient x3 in ( iX1 _2)4)l 1,4)(1i 6)(1_ )(I_.-X15 ) i. e. there are in all five irreducible invariants , which are of the degrees 2 , 4 , 6 , 10 and 15 respectively ; but these are connected by an equation of the degree 30 , i.e. the square of the invariant of the degree 15 is a rational and integral function of the other four invariants .
47 .
For a septic , the number of asyzygetic invariants of the degree 0 is. .
x 1-6 + 2x8-x0 + 5x2 + 2x+14 + 616 + 2x18 + 520x-22 2x24x26 +2 coefficient x in ( -4)( 6)( 8)(i-I)( 12 ) the numerator is equal to ( 1 X6 ) ( 1 8 ) -2( x10 ) ( 1 -_X2 ) ~-5 ( _ 14)-4 where the series of factors does not terminate ; hence the number of irreducible inva riants is infinite ; substituting the preceding value , the number of asyzygetic invariants of the degree 0 is coefficient Cx in ( 1 4)--4(1)(1)-3( x12)-6(l -x14)-4 ... The first four indices give the number of irreducible invariants of the corresponding degrees , i.e. there are 1 , 3 , 6 and 4 irreducible invariants of the degrees 4 , 8 , 12 and 14 respectively , but there is no reason to believe that the same thing holds with respect to the indices of the subsequent terms .
To verify this it is to be remarked , that there are 1 , 4 , 10 and 4 asyzygetic invariants of the degrees in question respectively ; there is therefore one irreducible invariant of the degree 4 ; calling this X4 , there is only one composite invariant of the degree 8 , viz. X2 ; there are therefore three irreducible invariants of this degrees say X8 , X8 , X " .
The composite invariants of the degree 12 are four in number , viz. X/ , X4X8 , X4X8 , X4Xg , and these cannot be connected by say syzygy , for if they were so , X2 , Xg , X ' , X ' would be connected by a syzygy , or there would be less than 3 irreducible invariants of the degree 8 .
Hence there are precisely 6 irreducible invariants of the degree 12 .
And since the irreducible invariants of the degrees 4 , 8 and 12 do not give rise to any composite invariant of the degree 14 , there are precisely 4 irreducible invariants of the degree 14 .
48 .
For an octavic , the number of the asyzygetic invariants of the degree 0 is ( l1-x)(l +X-_3-X4+rX6+X7+ ?
8+X9+XO1-X12_x13+X15+ 16 ) coefficient x ?
in ( { l--x2)2 x 3)2(1 4)(1 x5 ) ( 1 -x7 ) and the second factor of the numerator is ( I )-i(l 2)(I_X3)l-_X6)I-i( 8)-1(1 _- ) -1( 1_X1O)-1(1_X16 ( 1-X17)( 18)^ where the series of factors does not terminate , hence the numlber of irreducible invariants is infinite .
Substituting the preceding value , the number of the asyzygetic invariants of the degree 0 is coeff. x^ in ( 1-Z ) ( 1-x3)-l(l -xl4Y\\-S5)-(l -a6)-1( -7)-(l -t81(l -9)(l _10)-l( _1 )(1 9( _ 18 ) ... There is certainly one , and only one irreducible invariant for each of the degrees 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 respectively ; but the formula does not show the number of the irreducible invariants of the degrees 7 , &amp;c. ; in fact , representing the irreducible invariants of the degrees 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 by X2 , X , X4 , X , , X6 , these give rise to 3 composite invariants of the degree 7 , viz. X2X2X , , X2X , , X , X4 , which may or may not be connected by a syzygy ; if they are not connected by a syzygy , there will be a single irreducible invariant of the degree 7 ; but if they are connected by a syzygy , there will be two irreducible invariants of the degree 7 ; it is useless at present to pursue the discussion further .
Considering next the covariants,49 .
For a quadric , the number of asyzygetic covariants of the degree 0 is coefficient xt in ( )(1I ( I -X)(1 X2 ) ' 118 i. e. there are two irreducible covariants of the degrees 1 and 2 respectively ; these are of course the quadric itself and the invariant .
50 .
For a cubic , the number of the asyzygetic covariants of the degree 0 is coefficient x ?
in ( 1x)(( x4 ) The first factor of the numerator is the irreducible factor of 1-x2 , =(1-x2 ) +( 1- ) and the second factor of the numerator is the irreducible factor of 1-X4 , =(1-_4 ) ( 1 _X2 ) .
substituting these values , the number is coefficient xI in ( 1)(1--(i .
e. there are 4 irreducible covariants of the degrees 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 respectively ; but these are connected by an equation of the degree 6 ; the covariant of the degree I is the cubic itself U , the other ccvariants are the covariants already spoken of and represented by the letters H , ( D and V respectively ( I is of the degree 2 and the order 3 , ( D of the degree 3 and the order 3 , and V is of the degree 4 and the order 0 , i. e. it is an invariant ) .
51 .
For a quartic , the number of the asyzygetic covariants of the degree 0 is 1-x+x2 coefficient x in ( 1 _)2(1_x2)(1-X,3 ) the numerator of which is the irreducible factor of 1-x6 , i. e. it is equal to ( 1--x6)(1--x ) -(1 -x)(1 -x3 ) .
Making this substitution , the number is coefficient x0 in ( l_Zx)(12 X ) i. e. there are five irreducible covariants , one of the degree 1 , two of the degree 2 , and two of the degree 3 , but these are connected by an equation of the degree 6 .
The irreducible covariant of the degree 1 is of course the quartic itself U , the other irreducible covariants are those already spoken of and represented by I , H , J , &lt; ( respectively ( I is of the degree 2 and the order 0 , and J is of the degree 3 and the order 0 , i. e. I and J are invariants , H is of the degree 2 and the order 4 , ( I is of the degree 3 and the order 6 ) .
52 .
For a quintic , the number of irreducible covariants of the degree 0 is .
+x+X+ 4x3 + 6x4 + 8x5 + 9x6 + 10x7 + 12X8 + 10x9 + 9X10 + 8x11 + 6x12 + 413 + 14 + 15 + X6 coeff.x in ( 1 -2)2(1(4 ) ( 1 ' )(_ -8 ) the numerator of which is ( 1+2(1-+2 2++2X2+x3+2X4+3X5+x6+5X7+x8+3x9+2x0+Xll+2X-1 +X ) the first factor is ( l-x)-2(1 -x2)2 , the second factor is ( x)( X2)-2( 3a)-3(1 )2(15)-2(1 6)5(1 -7)5(1 --8)7(1 -_X)'(1-Xl ( 1 ) 1-R 2 119 which does not terminate ; the number of irreducible covariants is therefore infinite .
Substituting the preceding values , the expression for the number of the asyzygetic covariants of the degree d is coeff. x in ( 1 -x)-( --(1 X2()--(1 -_6 ) -4(1i7)5 ( 1_ 6)6( X7)(x ) 9)(1 -x)-9(1 ll)-19. .
which agrees with a previous result : the numbers of irreducible covariants for the degrees 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 are 1 , 2 , 3 and 3 respectively , and for the degree 5 , the number of irreducible covariants is three , but there is one syzygy between the composite covariants of the degree in question ; the difference 3-1=2 is the index taken with its sign reversed of the factor ( 1-x5)-2..53 .
I consider a system of the asyzygetic covariants of any particular degree and order of a given quantic , the system may of course be replaced by a system the terms of which are any linear functions of those of the original system , and it is necessary to inquire what covariants ought to be selected as most proper to represent the system of asyzygetic covariants ; the following considerations seem to me to furnish a convenient rule of selection .
Let the literal parts of the terms which enter into the coefficients of the highest power of x or leading coefficients be represented by Ma , M3 , My,. .
these quantities being arranged in the natural or alphabetical order ; the first in order of these quantities M. which enters into the leading coefficient of a particular covariant , may for shortness be called the leading term of such covariant , and a covariant the leading term of which is posterior in order to the leading term of another covariant , may be said to have a lower leading term .
It is clear , that by properly determining the multipliers of the linear functions we may form a covariant the leading terni of which is lower than the leading term of any other covariant ( the definition implies that there is but one such covariant ) ; call this E. We may in like manner form a covariant such that its leading term is lower than the leading term of every other covariant except 0 , ; or rather we may formt a system of such covariants , since if ( 2 be a covariant having the property in question , ( P &lt; +kO ?
1 will have the same property , but k may be determined so that the covariant shall not contain the leading term of 9i , i. e. we may form a covariant,2 such that its leading term is lower than the leading term of every other covariant excepting ?
0 , and that the leading term of 0 ?
does not enter into 2 , ; and there is but one such covariant , 0 , .
Again , we may form a covariant 30 such that its leading term is lower than the leading term of every other covariant excepting 0 , and 2 , , and that the leading terms of 0i and 0 , do not either of them enter into 0 , ; and there is but one such covariant , 03 .
And so on , until we arrive at a covariant the leading term of which is higher than the leading terms of the other covariants , and which does not contain the leading terms of the other covariants .
We have thus a series of covariants 0 , , 02 , 0 , , &amp;c. containing the proper number of terms , and which covariants may be taken to represent the asyzygetic covariants of the degree and order in question .
120 In order to render the covariants 0 definite as well numerically as in regard to sign , we may suppose that the covariant is in its least terms ( i. e. we may reject numerical factors common to all the terms ) , and we may make the leading term positive .
The leading term with the proper numerical coefficient , if different fiorm unity and with the proper power of x , or the order of the function annexed , will , when the covariants of a quantic are tabulated , be sufficient to indicate , without any ambiguity whatever , the particular covariant referred to .
I subjoin a table of the covariants of a quadric , a cubic and a quartic , and of the covariants of the degrees 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 respectively of a quintic , and also two other invariants of a quintic .

c4d4 The tables Nos. 13 to 24 are the irreducible covariants of the degrees 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 of a quintic .
No. 13 is the quintic itself ; No. 15 is the Hessian ; No. 19 is the quartinvariant ; No. 22 is the linear covariant ; the other covariants can be referred to by their degree and order , or simply by the number of the table .
The foregoing covariants are connected by the equation of the degree 5 and order 11 ( No. 13)(No .
21)+(No .
14)(No .
18)-(No .
15)(No .
17)=0 .
The table No. 25 is the simplest octinvariant , and the table No. 26 is the discriminant ; we have ( No. 26)=(No .
