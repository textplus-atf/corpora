On a new series of periodical colours produced by the grooved surfaces oJ metallic and transparent bodies .
By DAVID BREWSTER , L.L.D. F.R.S. L. SS E. Read May 21 , 1829 .
IN the year 1822 , when I received from Mr. BARTON some very fine specimens of his Iris ornaments , I availed myself of the opportunity of performing a series of experiments on the action of grooved surfaces upon light .
As the subject was to a certain extent new , many of the results which I obtained seemed to possess considerable interest , and I accordingly communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh a general account of them , which was read on the 3rd of February 1823 .
The interruptions , however , of professional pursuits prevented me , but at distant intervals , from pursuing the inquiry ; and having found that M. FRAUNHOFER was actively engaged in the very same research , with all the advantages of the finest apparatus and materials , I abandoned the subject , though with some reluctance , to his superior powers and means of investigation .
During a visit paid to Edinburgh by the Chevalier YELIN , a friend of FRAUNHOFER'S and a distinguished member of the Academy of Sciences of Munich , I showed him the general results which I had obtained ; and as he assured me that the phenomena which had principally occupied my attention had entirely escaped the notice of his friend* , I was thus induced to resume my labours , the results of which , in relation to one branch of the subject , I shall now submit to the consideration of the Society .
When a flat and polished metallic surface is covered with equal and equidistant grooves , we may characterize it by the relation of two quantities , one of which m represents the breadth of each groove , or of the surface that is removed , while the other n represents the breadth of the intermediate space , or of the original surface that is left .
If the image of a candle is seen by reflexion from such a surface , the trace of the plane of reflexion being parallel to the grooves , we observe the colourless image of a candle in the middle of a row of prismatic images arranged in a line perpendicular to the grooves .
The colourless image of the candle is formed by the original portions n of the mretallic surface , while the prismatic images are formed by the sides of the grooves m. This may be demonstrated ocularly by increasing m , and consequently diminishing n till the latter nearly disappears .
In this case the intensity of the prismatic images rises to a maximum , while the ordinary colourless image becomes extremely faint , and vice versa .
The general phenomena of the prismatic images , such as their distance from the common image , and the dispersion of their colours , depend entirely on the magnitude of m+ n , or the number of grooves and intervals that occupy any given space ; and the laws of these phenomena have been accurately determined by M. FRAUNHOFER .
In the course of my examination of the prismatic images , I observed in some specimens an unaccountable defalcation of particular colours , varying with the angle of incidence , and sometimes affecting one of the images and not the others .
It sometimes appeared in close and sometimes in wide systems of grooves , and from the symmetry of its effects , it became obvious that it was not owing to any accidental cause .
In the specimen in which it was most distinctly seen , I was surprised to observe that the white image reflected from the original surface of the steel was itself slightly coloured ; that its tint varied with the angle of incidence , and had some relation to the defalcation of colour in the prismatic images .
Hitherto I had used a small disc of light , but in order to observe through a great range of incidence I employed a long narrow rectangular aperture , which gave a convergent beam of 30 ?
or 40 ? .
I thus saw a series of very interesting phenomena .
The ordinary image of the aperture , as formed by the spaces n , was crossed in a direction perpendicular to its length , with broad coloured fringes varying in their tints from 90 ?
to 0 ?
of incidence .
This remarkable effect I observed in various specimens , having from 500 to 10,000 grooves in an inch .
In a specimen with 1000 grooves in an inch , or in which m +n = .
lOOdth of an inch , no less than four complete were developed as shown in the following Table .

These colours are obviously those of the reflected rings in thin plates .
By turning the steel plate round in azimuth , the very same coloulrs are seen at the same angles of incidence , and they suffer no change either by varying the distance of the luminous aperture , or the distance of the eye of the observer .
I now examined various other specimens which possessed the same property .
In some there were three orders of colours , in others two , and others one , while in some only one or two tints of the first order were developed .
These different effects are more minutely detailed in the following Table .

It is obvious from the preceding Table that the diversity of effect produced by different specimens does not depend upon the quantity m+ n , but upon n. The more that the original surface is ploughed away by the cutting diamond , the more brilliant were the tints , and the more numerous the orders of colours .
I was now desirous of seeing what effect would be produced when the original surface was almost wholly removed ; and Mr. BARTON was so obliging as to execute for me a specimen containing 2000 grooves in an inch , in which this was nearly effected .
His diamond point , however , having unfortunately broken before he had executed any considerable space , I was unable to make all the experiments with it which I could have wished .
This specimen produced four complete orders of colours , all of which were developed at much greater angles of incidence than those in the preceding Tables .

Let AB , Fig. 1 , be the reflected image Fig. .

Then in the 1st spectrum a b , the violet rays are obi literated at m at an incidence of 74 ?
, and the red rays at n at an incidence of 66 ?
, the intermediate colours , blue green , being obliterated at intermediate points between m. sm and n , and at angles of incidence interI mediate between 74 ?
and 66 ? .
In the\i 2nd spectrum a ' b ' , the violet rays are obliterated at m ' at an incidence of 66 ? ?

And in the #rJ V vri 4th spectrum a " ' b " ' , the violet rays are 6a 6b Bb b ' e6 1 " obliterated at m " ' at 48 ?
, and the red rays at n " ' at 23 ? ?
30 ' .
Another similar succession of obliterated tints takes place on all the prismatic images at a lesser incidence , as shown at R v , F ' v ' the violet being obliterated at p , and the red at v , and the intermediate colours at intermediate I points .
In this second succession the line pv begins and ends at the same angle of incidence , as the line m. " n " in the third prismatic image a " b ' ; and the line pi Y ' on the second prismatic image corresponds with m " ' n " ' on the fourth prismatic image .
Fig. .
Fig. 4 .
This singular obliteration of the colours is r. b Fig. 4 shown more clearly in Fig. 3 , where rmvn is a|XJ part of one of the prismatic images , rv the red it space , gg the green space , bb the blue , and w the violet space .
The line of obliteration mn in " fi , beginning at m obliterates the extreme violet at , , g m ; so that the curve of illumination a bmi , Fig.\ 4 , is just affected at one extremity m. The line advances into the spectrum , and at the point 1 corresponding to d , Fig. 4 , a portion of the blue and violet is obliterated , as shown by the notch l= in the curve ; at ea portion of the green and 5'I blue ; at ha portion of the red and green , and by / l at n the extreme red .
A similar obliteration of tints takes place on the ordinary image A B. The 1st obliteration , viz. that of the violet , takes place at o , Fig. 1 , and that of the red at p ; while the intermediate colours disappear at intermediate points .
This first space of obliteration has no corresponding one at the same incidence in any of the prismatic images .
The 2nd obliteration of the violet in AB takes place at q , and that of the red at r , and this corresponds in incidence with the obliterations m ' n ' , in ' n ' on the second prismatic image .
The 3rd obliteration of the violet takes place at s , and that of the red at t and this corresponds in incidence with the four obliterations on the second and fourth prismatic images , viz. p v , pie v ' , m " ' nl , mn " n " .
In all these phenomena the points m , n , p , , , &amp;c. , are only the points of minimum intensity , or of maximum obliteration ; for the tints never entirely disappear , and those obliterated at each line mn form an oblique spectrum containing all the prismatic colours .
Fig. 2 .
The analysis of these curious and apparently cornmA plicated phenomena becomes very simple when they P are examined under homogeneous illumination .
The effect produced in red light is represented in Fig. 2 , where AB is the image of the rectangular aperture ' reflected from the faces n of the steel , and the four images on each side of it correspond with the prismatic images .
All these nine images , however , consist of homogeneous red light , which is obliterated at the fifteen shaded rectangles , which are the minima of the new series of periodical colours which cross both the ordinary and the prismatic images .
2 , Ji v4 , n The centres p , r , t , n , v , &amp;c. of these rectangles correspond with the points marked with the same letters in Fig. 1 ; and if we had drawn the same figure for violet light , the centres of the rectangles would have corresponded with o , q , s , m , ^ , &amp;c. in Fig. 1 .
The I/ / , , rectangles should have been shaded off to represent I v !
| the phenomena accurately , but the only object of the J figure is to show to the eye the position and relations of the minima of the periods .
If it should be practicable to remove a still greater portion of the faces n , the first minimum p , Fig. 2 , would commence at a greater angle of incidence ; and other two rows of minima , namely , rows of five and six , would be found extending to the fifth and sixth prismatic images .
The arrangement and succession of these is easily deducible from Fig. 2 , where the law of the phenomenon is obvious to the eye .
The following table contains the angles of incidence reckoned from the perpendicular at which these minima occur in the extreme rays .

48 When the steel with 1000 grooves is exposed to common light , and the incident ray is very near the perpendicular , the 5th , 6th , 7th , and 8th prismatic images are combined into a mass of whitish light terminated externally by a black space .
As the angle of incidence increases , the 6th , 7th , 8th , and 9th images are combined into this mass , then the 7th , 8th , 9th , and 10th images , and so on , the black space which terminates this mass receding from the axis or image A B , Fig. 1 , as the obliquity of the incident ray increases .
Having covered the steel plate with water and oil of cassia in succession , I found the angular distances of the black space to be as follows at the same incidence .

Phenomena analogous to those above described take place on the grooved surfaces of gold , silver , and calcareous spar , &amp;c. In order to study this subject under a more general aspect , I was desirous of examining the phenomena exhibited by grooved surfaces of different refractive powers .
It was obviously impossible to procure systems of lines upon transparent bodies in which the grooves should have exactly the same distance and magnitude ; but I conceived it practicable to impress upon different substances the very grooves which produced the preceding phenomena , and I succeeded in impressing the system of 1000 grooves upon tin , realgar , and isinglass .

61 15 63 54 47 41 36 32 The following results were obtained with Isinglass .
The colours were generally the same as in the steel .
The first limit of pink and blue was at ... ... 75 45 The blue of second order ... 73 45 The second limit of pink and blue was at. .
54 30 In these experiments the tin gave nearly the same results as the steel ; but in the realgar and the isinglass similar tints were produced at a less angle of incidence than in the steel .
The minima of the periods were exhibited very finely on the isinglass , and were produced at smaller angles of incidence .
In a specimen with 1000 grooves upon isinglass , the third pink , or that seen upon steel at 360 , was the highest ; but after drying , the pink descended to yellow , and subsequently to green .
If the isinglass is removed from the steel when it is still soft , the edges of the grooves get rounded and lose their sharpness , and only one prismatic image is seen on each side of the ordinary image , as in mother-of-pearl .
The mass of white light is finely seen in the impressions taken upon tin , but never appears upon isinglass .
The preceding experiments do not afford any precise data for determining the influences of refractive power .
The realgar and the isinglass give fewer periods of colour so as to indicate that , caeteris paribus , a diminution of refractive power , produces a diminution in the number and orders of colours , or causes the minima to be developed at a less incidence .
This indication , however , is opposed by the fact , that as the isinglass dries and consequently increases in refractive power , the periods diminish in number , and the minima are produced at less incidences .
The modification of the tints by a change of refractive power is here masked by the influence of other causes , namely , an inferiority in the sharpness of the impression to that of the original surface , and a rounding of the narrow spaces n subsequently produced by induration .
In the specimen of isinglass , therefore , already mentioned , which gave the first limit of pink and blue at nearly the same angle as the steel , it is probable that it would have developed the same limit at a greater inclination had the impression been as sharp as the original .
In this uncertainty I conceived that the influence of a variable refractive power would be best obtained by placing different fluids on the surface of the grooved steel ; and upon using alcohol and oil of cassia my expectations were fulfilled .

I obtained similar results with grooves impressed upon wax ; so that we may now safely draw the conclusion that more orders of colours , and consequently higher tints at a given incidence , are developed by diminishing the refractive power of the grooved surface .
The influence of refractive power on the tints of the ordinary image being thus determined , it became interesting to ascertain its effects on the obliterated tints of the prismatic images .
As these tints never appeared unless when that of the ordinary image exceeded the blue of the second order , I took the specimen with 10,000 grooves , which had for its maximum tint a blue of the second order , but which exhibited no obliterated tints in the prismatic images .
Having placed upon it a film of oil of cassia , I raised the blue to a gamboge yellow , and I found that the fluid developed the phenomena of obliterated tints on the first prismatic image .
Owing to the great breadth of the spectrum , the distinct separation of the colours which composed it , and the great length of the line of obliteration , this phenomnenon was one of the most beautiful and remarkable that I have ever witnessed .
Hitherto I had examined the minima in the prismatic images as symmetrically related in position to the minima in the ordinary image , as shown in Figs. I and 2 ; but in studying some specimens in which the spaces n were very broad , and the grooves or spaces mn comparatively narrow , I was surprised to observe obliterated tints on the prismatic images , while the ordinar'y image was entirely free of colour .
This took place in two specimens , one of which had 312 , and the other 625 grooves in an inch .
The spaces n were here far too wide to produce the new tints , and so were the spaces m ; but upon applying the microscope to the grooves m , I saw that they were formed by two or more grooves ploughed out by the cutting point ; so that each space m actually consisted of smaller reflecting spaces , which were sufficiently minute to produce the periodical colours .
Although in these specimens , therefore , when m is nearly equal to n , we observe a beautiful coincidence between the positions of the minima on the ordinary and on the prismatic images , yet the fact above described seems to show that they are separate phenomena , and depend , when the grooves are single , on the relation between m and n. The preceding observations relate solely to rays reflected from grooved surfaces ; but in consequence of the almost perfect transparency of isinglass in thin plates , I have been enabled to examine the transmitted tints .
The colours which are thus seen on the ordinary image are extremely brilliant , but they seem to hate no relation whatever , either in number or in quality , to the reflected tints .
In the specimen which gave by reflexion three orders of colours , those seen by transmission were only the following .

Another specimen from the same steel plate gave , when soft and newly taken off , a bright purple at a perpendicular incidence , which passed through pink and blue at greater incidences .
But in the process of induration , the vertical purple became red , orange and yellow .
In a third impression the perpendicular tint was a bright pink when soft , which descended to yellow when drier .
In order to observe the relation between the reflected and transmitted tints , I took a fresh impression on very transparent isinglass , and obtained the following results .

0 The comparison of these tints affords the most satisfactory evidence that they are not complementary to each other .
The transmitted tints of the ordinary prismatic images always increase in brightness as the angle of incidence diminishes , while the reflected tints become fainter .
As I had preserved the different specimens of isinglass with which these experiments were made , it became interesting to observe the changes which their colours had undergone after a lapse of six years .
The following was the result .
1 .
A specimen with 1000 grooves exhibited no colours on the ordinary image either by reflexion or transmission .
The prismatic images of a candle were very faint , and the 4th could scarcely be seen .
2 .
Another specimen of 1000 grooves gave by reflexion one period of colours from white at great incidences through yellow up to purple at a vertical incidence .
By transmission a little yellow only was seen at a great incidence .
3 .
A third specimen of 1000 grooves which had been a fine sharp impression , gave by reflexion two orders of colours , the first limit of pink and blue being at 57 ? ?
45 ' , and the second limit nearly at a vertical incidence , a deep pink appearing at 10 ? .
By transmission the isinglass gave a bluish green at the greatest incidence which passed at lesser incidences through purple to yellow , which was the maximum tint .
In all these specimens the colours remain the same in all azimuths , provided the angle of incidence is invariable .
As the steel plate from which all these impressions had been taken was much injured , I resolved to grind down its surface by a polishing powder , and to observe the changes which took place .
As the effect of this was to increase the spaces n , the colours on the ordinary image soon disappeared .
The phenomenon of the obliterated tints was no longer seen , the mass of white light disappeared , and from the rounding of the edges , of the grooves the prismatic images were fewer in number , though their distance was unchanged .
When one of the impressed films of isinFg .
5 .
glass mn , Fig. 5 , was laid upon a plate of e glass ABC D , and was in optical contact with it , a series of fringes was seen across the images reflected from the second surface CD of the glass .
These fringes seen by the A _Z_ eye at df , and formed by the rays abc of , are parallel to the grooves on the isinglass , and their breadth diminishes as the thickness AC of the glass is increased .
When the grooves were 1000 in an inch , these fringes were nearly as distinct as the prismatic images , one fringe appearing to bisect each image when the thickness AC was about l th of an inch .
They were much more numerous , and even crossed the principal image when AC was 4th of an inch ; but when AC was lth of an inch , no fringes were seen across the second image .
These fringes have the same origin as those which I have described in the Edinburgh Transactions .
In the first specimen , where AC was --th of are inch , its two surfaces were not parallel , and the direction of the grooves in the isinglass was accidentally perpendicular to the common section of the two surfaces of the glass .
Hence the fringes produced by the glass were parallel to the prismatic images from the isinglass .
But when the specimen is turned round , the isinglass fringes reflected from the back of the glass are crossed by those produced by the glass , giving to the former the appearance of a coloured rope , in which the coils pass along the longitudinal spectra with singular beauty .
Such are the leading phenomena of this new and remarkable class of periodical colours ; but though their general law and the circumstances upon which they depend seem to be pretty clearly shown in the preceding experiments , yet feel great difficulty in assigning a satisfactory cause for their production .
That they are not owing to the diffraction and interference of the rays reflected from two or more of the surfaces n , considered as narrow slits or apertures , is obvious ; for in that case they would be affected by the distance of the luminous object and the distance of the eye , and the colours would form bands parallel to the direction of the grooves .
In my experiments on the production of the complementary colours by the -metallic reflexion of polarized light , I have shown that one reflexion from a plate of silver , &amp;c. is equivalent in its action to a given thickness of a crystallized film , and that the tints descend in the scale by increasing the angle of incidence as if the equivalent film had diminished in thickness .
That these colours are produced by the interference of two pencils , one of which suffers reflexion later than the other , cannot be doubted ; but whether these two portions are reflected within the sphere of reflecting activity , at such distances as to produce colours by their interference , or whether the one is reflected in the usual manner , while the other is not reflected till it has penetrated a certain thickness of the polished metal , it is not easy to ascertain .
If either of these effects takes place with polarized light , an analogous effect should be produced with common light , though the intensity of the interfering pencils might in this case be very inconsiderable .
If we suppose that the spaces n are smaller than the distance to which the reflecting force extends , the removal of the metal from the adjacent grooves must diminish the reflecting force of these spaces .
That this is the case may , we think , be inferred from direct experiment .
At the separating surface of the steel and a fluid , we observe a certain change in the action of the steel surface , which can be ascribed to no other cause than the diminution of the refractive and reflective power of the surface .
Now it is manifest from experiment that the diminution of the spaces n has exactly the same effect , the colours not only being rendered brighter by each of these causes , but the minima being produced at greater angles of incidence .
Since in a system of grooves with only 312 in an inch , oil of cassia developes colours which did not previously exist , it is evident that if we had fluids of much higher refractive power , colours would be produced when the spaces n were much larger , and when the fluid approached in refractive density to that 2s2 of the metal , we should witness the periodical colours without any grooves at all on the reflecting surface ; so that the phenomena would then become identical with those which are developed at the separating surface of transparent bodies .
We can scarcely , therefore , avoid the conclusion , that the removal of the substance from the grooves , whether they are made on metal or on transparent bodies , diminishes the refractive power of the intermediate spaces .
On the hypothesis of emission , this abstraction of the reflecting matter may be regarded as equivalent to a diminution of the density of the surface ; while on the undulatory hypothesis , the effect may be ascribed to the condition of the ether arisng fro a variation in its density or elasticity towards the extremities of a number of salient points ,
