Supplementary Observations on the Dffusion of Liquids .
By THOMAS GAHAM , F.R.S. , F.C.S. Received May 2 , -Read June 20 , 1850 .
THE experiments of my former paper furnished strong grounds for believing that isomorphous salts possess a similar diffusibility .
All the salts of potash and ammonia , which were compared , appeared to be equi-diffusive ; so also were the salts of certain magnesian bases .
A single preliminary observation on the nitrates of lead and baryta , however , opposed the general conclusion , and demanded further inquiry .
It is scarcely necessary to say that any new means of recognizing the existence of the isornorphous relation between different substances , must prove highly valuable .
Let us inquire therefore how far liquid diffusion is available for that purpose .
The salts were still diffused from weak solutions , that is from solutions containing from 1 to 8 per cent. of salt ; but now a measure of the solution , equal to 100 grs. of water , was made to contain I grain of the salt , to form what is called the 1 per cent. solution ; instead of 1 grain of salt being added to 100 grs. of water , as before , without reference to the condensation which generally occurs .
The quantities 1 , 2 , 4 and 8 per cent. thus indicate the parts of salt present in a constant volume of liquid , -as 10 , 20 , 40 and 80 grs. of the salt in 1000 water grain-measures of the solution .
The same phials for the solution and jars for the external water-atmosphere continued to be used , and the manipulations were similar .
It is believed , however , that the temperature of the liquids was maintained more uniform in the new experiments than the old , partly by the better regulation of the temperature of the apartment , and partly by placing the jars close together upon a table with upright ledges , and covering the whole over with sheets of paper during the continuance of an experiment .
The mass of fluid in 80 or 100 jars , which were employed at once and placed together , made the small oscillations of temperature , which might still occur , slow and less injurious .
The investigation is also extended to several new substances , such as hydrocyanic acid , acetic acid , sulphurous acid , alcohol , ammonia and salts of organic bases , without reference to isomorphous relations .
It is very necessary to have data which are minute and accurate respecting the diffusion of a considerable variety of substances .
This it is my present object to endeavour to supply , leaving speculative deductions in general respecting the nature and laws of liquid diffusion for a future occasion .
The density of all the solutions was observed at a constant temperature , namely , 60 ?
FAHR. Hydrochloric Acid .
The period of diffusion arbitrarily chosen for this acid was five days .
The diffusate , or quantity of acid diffused , was determined by precipitating the liquid of the external reservoirs with nitrate of silver , and weighing the chloride of silver formed .
In the 1 and 2 per cent. solutions , the liquids of two jars were generally mixed and precipitated together .
( 1 .

Calculated for 1 per cent. , 7*56 grs. at 53 ?

, when corrected for that temperature .
( 2 .
) Hydrochloric acid , 1P92 per cent. ; density 1'009 .

, in eight cells , 14-71 , 14-05 , 14-54 , 14-47 ; mean 14'44 grs. for two cells .

for two cells .
( 3 .
) Hydrochloric acid , 1-993 per cent. ; density 1-0094 .
Diffused at 62 ?
'8 , in six cells , two experiments on one-sixth part of the mixed jars gave 8*203 , 8,198 ; mean 8-20 grs. for one cell , or 16-40 grs. for two cells .
Calculated for 2 per cent. , 16-46 grs. at 62 ?
08 for two cells .
( 4 .
) Hydrochloric acid , 3-90 per cent. ; density 1'0190 .
Diffused at 51 ?
, in eight cells , 29-18 , 30'70 , 30-70 , 29'26 ; mean 29'96 grs. for two cells .
Calculated for 4 per cent. , 30'72 grs. at 51 ?
for two cells .
( 5 .
) Hydrochloric acid , 7*90 per cent. ; density 103S0 .
Diffused at 5 ] ?
, in four cells , 32-71 , 33'64 , 33'64 , 33'74 ; mean 33*43 grs. for one cell .
Calculated for 8 per cent. , 33'84 grs. at 51 ?
for one cell .
Comparing the diffusibilities of the 2 per cent. solutions ( 2 and 3 ) at 510 and 62 ?
.8 , an increase is observed from 15-04 to 16,40 grs. , or from 100 to 109-1 , which gives an increase of 0-77 per cent. for 1 ? .
This method of estimating the effect of temperature is not exact , as the times only in which an equal diffusion at the different temperatures takes place are truly comparable .
We may deduce from it , however , the effect of the small difference of temperature of 2 ?
5 of the 1 per cent. solution from the others , as has ben done , without sensible error .
The diffusates at the same temperature would then be as follows : Diffusion of Hydrochloric Acid in five days at 51 ?

From 1 per cent. solution ... 7-41 0'97 From 2 per cent. solution ... .
1504 2'00 From 4 per cent. solution ... 30'72 4'08 From 8 per cent. solution ... .
67'68 9'00 The increasing diffusibility with the larger proportions of acid here observed is unusual , at least in the degree exhibited by the 8 per cent. solution .
Other substances , as will be immediately observed of nitric acid , appear to lose proportionally in diffusibility as their solutions are concentrated .
806 Hydrochloric acid belongs to the most diffusive class of substances known ; it appears to exceed hydrate of potash at 53 ?
05 , as 7*56 to 6 ; 12 , or as 100 to 80'9* .
The rapidity with which hydrochloric acid diffuses , and the facility with which that substance may be estimated , induced me to examine the progression with which its diffusion takes place with increasing times in a minute manner .
The 2 per cent. solution was diffused for times increasing by six hours , from twelve hours or 0'5 day to 4'75 days , six cells being diffused for every period .
Instead of determining the acid diffused separately in each jar or pair of jars , the contents of the six jars of each experiment were mixed together , and a definite proportion of the liquid precipitated by nitrate of silver , so as to obtain at once the mean result .
Another observation for 5'75 days is added , although made at a sensibly higher temperature .

The diffusion at 3-5 days is also increased by a rise of temperature of more than 1 ?
in that and the following experiments .
The diffusion always increases with the time , but less rapidly , according to a gradually diminishing progression .
2 .
Hydriodic Acid , Hydrobromic Acid and Bromine .
Hydriodic Acid.-Time of diffusion five days , as for hydrochloric acid .
The acid diffused was estimated from the iodide of silver which it gave when precipitated by nitrate of silver .
Hydriodic acid , 1'98 per cent. ; density 1'0142 .
Diffused at 53 ?
'5 , in eight cells , 14'90 , 15*67 , 15'25 , 15'27 ; mean 15'27 grs. for two cells .
Calculated for 2 per cent. , 15'42 grs. at 53 ?
05 for two cells , or 15-11 grs. at 51 ? .
These experiments indicate a similarity of diffusion between the two isomorphous substances , hydrochloric and hydriodic acids .

FAHR. Hydrochloric acid ... 15-04 100 Hydriodic acid. .
15.11 100'46 Hydrobromic Acid.-Time of diffusion five days .
The diffusate was estimated from the bromide of silver .
( 1 .
) Hydrobromic acid , 1'556 per cent. ; density 1'0112 .
Diffused at 59 ?
07 , in eight cells .
The whole diffusates mixed together gave by analysis a mean of 12-90 grs. of hydrobromic acid .
in two cells ; calculated for 2 per cent. , 16-58 grs. in two cells , at 590-7 .
( 2 .
) The experiment was repeated at 590 ?
8 , with a solution containing 1-578 per cent. of hydrobromic acid , of density 1P0116 , with five diffusion phials not employed above .
The mean diffusate for a pair of cells was 13'05 grs. of hydrobromic acid ; that is , 16-53 grs. for a2 per cent. solution , which is as nearly as possible the result of the preceding series of experiments .
( 3 .
) Another solution containing exactly 2 per cent. of hydrochloric acid was diffused for comparison in eight cells , in the same circumstances of time and temperature as ( 1 .
) ; its density was 1'0104 .
Diffusate from 2 per cent. solutions at 59 ?
07 FAHR. Hydrochloric acid. .
16'55 100 Hydrobromic acid. .
16-58 100'18 Hydrobromic acid appears therefore to coincide in diffusibility with hydrochloric acid at this temperature .
It may be remarked that these three acids , hydrochloric , hydrobromic and hydriodic , do not exhibit the same correspondence in another physical property , namely , the densities of their aqueous solutions containing the same proportion of acid .
The densities of 2 per cent. solutions of hydrochloric and hydriodic acids appear to be respectively 1P0104 and 1-0143 , at 600 FAHR. , and that of hydrobromic acid will obviously be an intermediate number .
The same acids are also known to differ considerably in the boiling-points of solutions containing the same proportion of acid .
A considerable diversity of physical properties appears here to be compatible with equal diffusibility in substances which are isomorphous .
Bromine.-Pure water readily dissolves more than 1 per cent. of this substance .
The solution prepared , however , contained only 0'864 per cent. of bromine , as was ascertained by treating it with sulphurous acid and afterwards precipitating by nitrate of silver .
Its density was 1'0070 .
It was evident , from the slow appearance of the brown colour in the exterior cell , that bromine diffuses less rapidly than hydrobromic acid .
808 The diffusion-time of bromine was made ten days , or double the time of hydrobromic acid .
Two cells contained together a diffusate of 5-80 grs. of bromine ; another two cells a diffusate of 5'88 grs. ; mean 5*84 grs. at 60 ?
'1 FAHR. ; or 6'76 grs. for a1 per cent. solution .
Doubling the last result we have 13*52 grs. for a2 per cent. solution , which is still considerably under the diffusate of hydrobromic acid ( 16*58 grs. ) in half the time .
3 .
Hydrocyanic Acid .
Time of diffusion five days .
The acid diffused was estimated from the cyanide of silver which it gave with nitrate of silver .
Hydrocyanic acid , 1'766 per cent. , made up to a density of 1'0142 with sulphate of potash .
Diffused at 64 ?
02 , in six cells , 11'40 , 11[86 , 11'80 ; mean 11'68 grs. for two cells .
Calculated for 2 per cent. , 13'23 grs. at 64 ?
02 in two cells , or about 13'10 grs. at 62 ?
08 , assuming this acid to be affected in the same way by temperature as hydrochloric acid .
Hydrocyanic acid here appears less diffusive than hydrochloric acid , at the same temperature 620 ?
8 , as 13,10 to 16 40 , or as 79*6 to 100 , and not to belong therefore to the same class of diffusive substances .
4 .
Nitric Acid .
Time of diffusion five days .
The quantity of this acid diffused was always determined with great exactness by neutralization by means of a normal solution of carbonate of soda .

That time of diffusion arbitrarily chosen for this acid was ten days .
The diffusate of this acid was determined in the same manner as that of nitric acid .

7 for one cell .
In the 2 per cent. solution the diffusion rises , with the difference of temperature between 49 ?
07 and 63 ?
05 , from 16'91 to 19'73 grs. , or from 100 to 116'68 .
This is an increase of 1'209 per cent. for one degree of temperature .

68'96 8*16 The diffusibility of different strengths of this acid appears to be pretty uniform , but with a slight tendency to increase in the higher proportions , like hydrochloric acid .
Sulphuric acid is greatly inferior in velocity of diffusion to hydrochloric acid , but still appears to possess considerably more than half the diffusibility of the latter .
6 .
Chromic Acid .
Time of diffusion ten days .
The diffusates from four cells of the 2 per cent. solution were mixed together , and the quantity of chromic acid diffused for two cells reduced by means of hydrochloric acid and alcohol , and weighed as oxide of chromium .
1'762 per cent. of anhydrous chromic acid , density 1-01404 , diffused at 670 ?

5 L2 811 Acetic Acid .
Time of diffusion ten days .
This acid cannot be determined accurately by the acidimetrical method , owing to the acetates of potash and soda being essentially alkaline to test-paper , like the carbonates of the same bases , although neutral in composition .
The weight of carbonate of baryta dissolved by the acid was had recourse to .

This acid appears to be considerably less diffusive than sulphuric acid .
I was led to over-estimate the diffusion of acetic acid in a preliminary observation of my former paper , by trusting to the acidimetrical method of determination .
Hydrochloric acid appears to diffuse about two and a half times more rapidly than acetate of water , at the same temperature .
8 .
Sulphurous Acid .
The time of diffusion chosen for this acid was ten days , for comparison with sulphuric acid .
The usual number of eight cells of the 1 and 2 per cent. solutions were diffused , and four cells of the 4 and 8 per cent. solutions .
The whole diffusates of each proportion were then mixed together , and the proportional quantity of liquid representing two cells in the 1 and 2 per cent. solutions , and 1 cell in the 4 and 8 , was converted into sulphuric acid by a slight excess of bromine , and determined from the sulphate of baryta .

Ammonia .
The time of diffusion chosen was 4*041 days , or that of hydrate of potash with chloride of sodium at seven days .
The usual number of eight cells of the I and 2 per cent. solutions were diffused , and four cells of the 4 and 8 per cent. solutions .
The whole diffusates of each proportion were then mixed together , and the quantity of ammonia diffused for two cells determined by an alkalimetrical experiment , which was always repeated twice .
It was necessary for diffusion to have the ammoniacal solution made denser than water , which was effected by the addition of common salt .

It appears somewhat less diffusive than hydrocyanic acid at the same temperature , in the proportion of 12 to 13 nearly ; or to possess about three-fourths of the diffusibility of hydrochloric acid .

The results accord less closely with each other than usual , owing , I believe , chiefly to the difficulties of manipulation when the density of the liquid placed in the phials to be diffused approaches so nearly to that of water .
This is more particularly true of the 8 per cent. solution .

Alcohol does not appear to belong to the same class of diffusive substances as acetic acid , which might be expected from their similarity of composition , but possesses a considerably lower diffusibility .

Alcohol may be substituted for water to dissolve certain salts , and also as an atmosphere into which these salts may diffuse .
From experiments which have been commenced on this subject , it appears that the diffusion of hydrate of potash , iodide of potassium , chloride of calcium and others is about four times slower into alcohol of density 0'840 than into water .
The salts likewise often exhibit the same relations in their diffusibility in alcohol , as in water , with some singular exceptions , such as chloride of mercury .

44'46 96*83 The near coincidence of the 4 per cent. solutions probably arises frot an accidental error of observation in the chloride of barium , for the latter departs here from the progression of its ratios .
We appear then to have a small but constant difference of 818 about 3 per cent. in the diffusioni of these two isomorphous salts , the chloride of barium , which possesses the highest atomic weight , having the advantage .
The diffusion of the 1 per cent. solution of the same salts for the longer period of 1143 days , gives 7 50 for chloride of bariumn at 500 ?

52 for chloride of strontium at 51 ?

For the first time we have in the barytic salts a divergence between chlorides and nitrates , for the nitrates of the same bases have a number about 6*8 only at the same temperature .
I am led however to believe that this discrepancy becomes much less at low temperatures by experiments which are at present in progress .

Sesquichloride of Iron .
A full series of observations was made upon the diffusion of the different propor- .

The mean diffusion from the 1 per cent. solution in 11.43 days , at 63 ?
*3 , was 4.13 grs. of sesquichloride of iron with 1-28 gr. of free hydrochloric acid , in two cells .
This result indicates that one-half nearly of the sesquichloride of iron is decomposed in the diffusion .
The mean diffusion from the 8 per cent. solution , at 63 ?

of sesquichloride of iron , with 6*66 grs. of free hydrochloric acid , in two cells .
It appears from this experiment that perchloride of iron approaches the chloride of calcium in diffusibility .
That the protoand persalts of the mitgnesian metals should have a similar rate of diffusion , is not unlikely from other analogies which they exhibit .

101'42 2'560 It will be remarked that the diffusion of these two isomorphous salts , sulphate of magnesia and sulphate of zinc , differs so much , in the 1 per cent. solution , as 7*31 to 6'67 , that is , as 100 to 91'25 ; or 8'75 per cent. This I have no doubt , however , is an accidental error , the disturbances from changes of temperature and other causes of dispersion being in direct proportion to the duration of the experiment , and therefore much increased with these long times ; while the 1 per cent. solution also appears to be generally the proportion most exposed to such errors .
The sulphate of zinc appears to be the truest throughout , in its diffusion , of these two salts .
The approach to equality becomes close in the 4 per cent. and larger proportions of salt , particularly with the unusually high proportions of 16 and 24 per cent. , which were observed in these salts .
The diffusion of both salts falls off remarkably in the higher proportions .
The result of the comparison of these two magnesian sulphates is no doubt favourable to the similarity of diffusion of isomorphous salts .

A series of observations were made upon the diffusion of the 1 per cent. solution of chloride of potassium at a nearly constant temperature of 56 ?
, but for different times , varying from five days to eight days , and eighteen hours , to discover the progression , which proved to be pretty similar to that of the 2 per cent. solution of hydrochloric acid .

This is somewhat more than 5'68 , one-half of the diffusate of the 2 per cent. solution of iodide of potassium , at nearly the same temperature .
The diffusion , however , of the small proportions of salts of ammonium , such as the I per cent. solution , is apt to be given in excess , from their low density .
36 .
Dichloride of Copper .
Time of diffusion seven days , or that of chloride of sodiurn .
he salt diffused was obtained by evaporation to dlyness , in an air-bath , after treating the liquid with an excess of chlorine , in the form of chloride , from which the dichloride was calculated .
It was an object of interest to discover whether the dichloride of copper ( Cu2 Cl ) , which should be isomorphous with the chloride of sodium , may separate from the protochloride of copper and other magnesian salts , and assume the high diffusibility of the salts of alkaline metals .
But the salt in question is entirely insoluble in water .
A solution , however , was obtained by dissolving an equivalent quantity of the red suboxide of copper recently precipitated , in hydrochloric acid , of density 1'033 , so as to give one grain of dichloride in every hundred water-grain measures of the solution .
This acid solution did not precipitate by dilution with water .
The salt was diffused into pure water at a mean temperature of 53 ? ?

Dichloride of copper diffused , 6'66 , 6 57 , 7'01 and 6,48 grs. ; mean 6'68 grs. in two cells .
Chloride of sodium at 53 ?
'4 , nearly the same temperature , gave 5'90 grs. in the same time .
Reducing the result to the temperature of 51 ?
by an approximative correction , we should have 6'48 grs. of dichloride of copper for that temperature , at which chloride of calcium gave 6*51 grs. in 11-43 days , and protochloride of copper ( Cu CI ) 6'06 grs. at nearly the same temperature , also in 11'43 days .
So far as we can judge from an experiment at a single temperature , it would appear that the diffusion of dichloride of copper is more rapid than that of the chloride ( Cu C1 ) , in a proportion which supposes the former compound to possess half the " solution-density " of the latter , the times of equal diffusion 7 and 1 1143 days , being when squared as 1 to 2 .
With the view of discovering whether the large proportion of hydrochloric acid , amounting to 7 per cent. , present in the preceding solution of dichloride of copper , modified the diffusion of the salt , a portion of the same acid solution was treated with chlorine gas , to convert the copper salt into chloride , and diffused into water , after 831 the excess of chlorine was removed by agitation of the solution with air .
The proportion of salt present was thus increased in weight from 1 to 1*36 per cent. The time of diffusion was 11'43 days , and the temperature 53 ? .
2 .
Chloride of copper diffused from a 1'36 per cent. solution of the salt in hydrochloric acid , 5-83 , 5'66 , and 5'30 grs. in two cells ; mean 5'60 grs. The corresponding diffusion from a1 per cent. solution may be supposed to be less than 5*6 grs. , in the proportion of 1'36 to 1 , without any great error .
The results thus become chloride of copper diffused , 3-98 , 3,85 and 3*58 grs. ; mean 3 80 grs. in two cells .
It hence appears that the diffusion of chloride of copper is much diminished by the presence of a great excess of hydrochlor'ic acid in the same solution .
Different causes suggest themselves for this result , such as the possibility of a combination existing of chloride of copper with chloride of hydrogen , in the acid solution ; or the influence which must be admitted of the more soluble substance , in a mixture of two similar substances , in repressing the diffusion of the less soluble .
The present result , however , is entirely opposed to the idea that the high diffusibility of the dichloride of copper , observed before , is due to the hydrochloric acid present .
3 .
The diffusion of chloride of sodium also appears to be repressed by contact with a large excess of hydrochloric acid .
One per cent. of chloride of sodium raised the density of dilute hydrochloric acid from 1'035 to 1'0408 .
Diffused into pure water for seven days at 52 ?
'9 , in eight cells , the diffusates of chloride of sodium were 3'80 , 3'87 , 4'00 and 3*86 grs. ; mean 3*88 for two cells .
The diffusion of chloride of sodium is thus reduced in a corresponding measure with that of chloride of copper by association with seven times its weight of hydrochloric acid .
These results are interesting in a very different point of view .
I have always watched for the appearance of some absorbent or imbibing power on the part of the acids , more analogous to an endosmotic attraction for water , as usually conceived .
If such an attraction existed , it would complicate the phenomena .
of diffusion , for the volume of water absorbed by the acid would displace and project a portion of the latter into the reservoir , the phial not being extensible .
The high difftsibility of hydrochloric and nitric acids would be thus explained .
But by such a mechanical displacement the chloride of sodium would be thrown out in the preceding experiment , as well as the hydrochloric acid , which is not the case .
4 .
Even in hydrochloric acid of density 1-124 ( 25 per cent. ) , the diffusion of 1 per cent. of chloride of sodium for seven days , at 560 ?
6 , was found to amount to 4-7 grs. only in two cells , and is less than from a solution in pure water .
5 .
In comparing the influence of nitric acid with that of hydrochloric acid upon the diffusion of chloride of sodium , it was found that in a7 per cent. solution of nitric acid , the chloride of sodium ( 1 per cent. ) was entirely decomposed in the diffusive process , at 560 ?
6 , and gave hydrochloric acid in the full diffusive equivalent of that acid , together with nitrate of soda .
832 Bicarbonate of Potash .
Time of diffusion 8*083 days , or double that of hydrate of potash .
The water of the jars was partially charged with carbonic acid gas , to prevent the decomposition of this and the other bicarbonates in the act of diffusion .

The times chosen for these two bicarbonates is to that of the bicarbonate of soda , as the square root of 2 to the square root of 3 , and the remarkable agreement observed in the diffuision of these salts gives support therefore to that relation .
In alluding to this relation , however , it is proper to add that the carbonates of potash and soda deviate from it in a sensible degree , and the hydrates of potash and soda very considerably .
If the relation therefore has a real foundation , it must be masked in the salts last named by differences existing between them in certain properties , the discovery and investigation of which is of the last importance for the theory of liquid diffusion .

The quantities refer to anhydrous salt , and were estimated from the chlorine , as with hydrochlorate of morphine .
These two analogous salts appear to approach very closely in diffusibility .

'4 , the 1 per cent. solution of hydrochlorate of morphine gave a mean result of 5 49 grs. from two cells , and the hydrochlorate of strychnine 5177 grs. from two cells .
But the weights of chloride of silver from which these numbers are deduced were too small to admit of much precision .
The diffusion of these salts of organic bases in 11-43 days , is exceeded by the diffusion of chloride of ammonium or potassium in 5'71 days , or half the former time .
The vegeto-alkalies appear thus to be divided from ammonia and potash .
The new observations of the present paper are favourable to the existence of a relation amounting to close similarity or equality in diffusibility between certain classes of substances .
The chlorides and nitrates of the same metal generally exhibit this correspondence , as in the chloride of calcium and nitrate of lime , the chloride of sodium and nitrate of soda , and also in hydrochloric and nitric acids .
Isomorphous salts exhibit the same relation , as has been observed in the chlorides , bromides and iodides of potassium , sodium and hydrogen , in various salts of baryta , strontia and lead , in numerous magnesian salts , in the salts of silver , soda , and probably those of suboxide of copper , and in several additional salts of potash and ammonia .
Corresponding salts of two of the vegeto-alkalies are also found to be equidiffusive .
Before discussing the relations between the different groups of equidiffusive substances which are thus formed , it will be necessary to examine their diffusion at widely different temperatures , a subject attended with considerable difficulty .
