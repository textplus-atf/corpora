I. " On the Porism of the in-and-circumscribed Polygon .
" By ARTHUR CAYLEY , Esq. , F.R.S. Received February 20 , 1861 .
( Abstract .
) The Porism referred to is as follows , viz. two conics may be so related to each other , that a polygon may be inscribed in the one , and circumscribed about the other conic , in such manner that any point whatever of the circumscribing conic may be taken for a vertex of the polygon .
I gave in the year 1853 , in the Philosophical Magazine* , a general formula for the relation between the two conics , viz. if U=O is the equation of the inscribed conic , V=O that of the circumscribed conic , and if disc ( U+4 V ) , where 4 is an arbitrary multiplier , denotes the discriminant of U+V in regard to the coordinates ( x , , y , ) ( such discriminant being of course a cubic function in regard to X , and also in regard to the coefficients of the two conies U , V , jointly ) , then if we write Vdisct ( U+4V)=A+B+ CS2+D3 +E4 F5 + GF S &amp;c. , the relations for the cases of the triangle , pentagon , heptagon , &amp;c. are C= , , D =0 , C D , E =0 , &amp;c. D , E D , E , F E , F , G respectively , while those in the cases of the quadrangle , hexagon , octagon , &amp;c. are D=0 , , DE 0 , , , E , F =0 , &amp; e. E , F E , F , G F , G , H respectively .
The demonstration of this fundamental theorem is for greater completeness here reproduced ; but the chief object of the memoir is to direct attention to a curious analytical theorem , which is an easy a priori consequence of the Porism , and to obtain the relations for the several polygons up to the enneagon , in a new and simple form , which puts in evidence a posteriori for these cases , the analytical theorem just referred to .
The analytical theorem rests upon the following considerations : the relation for a hexagon ought to include that for a triangle ; in fact a triangle with its sides in order twice over is a fori of hexagcon ; the condition for an octagon should in like manner include that for a quadrangle ; and so in other cases .
Let the cubic function disct ( U + -V ) be represented by 1 -+ / 3y2+ ~,3 , the coefficients A , B , C , D , E , &amp;c. are functions of , y , , Write uD C , D D , E D , E E , F C , D , D , E , E , F , =-(5 ) , =(6 ) , E =(7 ) , FG &amp; e. = ( 3 ) , =(4 ) , Then ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) are respectively prime functions of f3 , y , a ; that is they cannot be decomposed into factors , rational functions of these quantities ; and it is convenient to denote this by writing ( 3)=[3 ] , ( 4 ) = [ 4 ] , ( 5 ) = [ 5 ] .
But by what precedes , ( 6 ) contains the factor ( 3 ) , that is [ 3 ] ; and if the other factor , which is prime , is denoted by [ 6 ] , then we have ( 6 ) =[6 ] [ 3 ] .
The next term ( 7 ) is prime , that is we have ( 7)=[7 ] ; but the term ( 8 ) gives ( 8)=[8 ] [ 4 ] ; the term ( 9 ) gives ( 9)=[9 ] [ 3 ] , and so on .
Thus we have ( 12)=[12 ] [ 6 ] [ 4 ] [ 3 ] , the numbers in [ ] being all the factors , the number itself included , and as well composite as prime , of the number in ( ) , the factors 2 and 1 being however excluded .
To make this clearer , it may be remarked that the last-mentioned equation has the geometrical signification that the relation for a dodecagon is the aggregate of the relations for a proper dodecagon , a proper hexagon , a quadrangle , and a triangle ; that is , the relation for a dodecagon implies one or other of the last-mentioned relations .
The relations for the several polygons up to the enneagon are in the memoir obtained in a form which puts in evidence the property in question , that is , the series of equations ( 3)= [ 3 ] , ( 4)=[4 ] , ( 5)= [ 5 ] , ( 6)=[6 ] [ 3 ] , ( 7)=[7 ] , ( 8)=[8 ] [ 4 ] , ( 9)=[9 ] [ 3 ] .
To do this , the discriminant is represented , not as above in terms of the constants F3 , y , , but in a somewhat different form , by means of the constants 6 , c , d , the last two whereof are such that c= 0 is the the relation for the triangle , d=0 the relation for the quadrangle ; thus [ 3]=c , [ 4]=d , and for the particular cases considered , the analytical theorem consists herein , that c is a factor of ( 6 ) , and of ( 9 ) , and that d is a factor of ( 8 ) .
I have , for the sake of homogeneity , introduced into the formulae the quantity a(= 1 ) , but this is a matter of form only .
The functions [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , &amp;c. have been spoken of as prime ; they are so , in fact , as far they are calculated ; and that they are so in general rests on the assumption that for a polygon of a given number of sides , there is but one form of relation : if , for instance , in the equation [ 12 ] =0 , which is the condition for a proper dodecagon , the function [ 12 ] could be decomposed into rational factors ; then equating each of these factors to zero , we should have so many distinct forms of relation for a proper dodecagon .
I believe that the assumption and reasoning are valid ; but without entering further into this , I take it for granted that in the general case the functions [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , &amp;c. are in fact prime .
But the coefficients 3 , y , 3 , or b , c , d , instead of being so many independent arbitrary quantities , may be given as rational functions of other quantities ( if , for instance , the two conics are circles , radii R , r , and distance between the centres a , then / 3 , y , 6 will be functions of R , r , a ) : and it is in a case of this kind quite conceivable that the functions [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , &amp;c. , considered as functions of these new elements , should cease to be prime functions .
In fact , in the case just referred to of the two circles ( the original case of the Porism as considered by Fiuss ) , the functions [ 4 ] , [ 6 ] , &amp;c. , which correspond to a polygon of an even number of sides , appear to be each of them decomposable into two factors : the memoir contains some remarks tending to show a priori that in the case in question this decomposition takes place .
I was led to examine the point by the elegant formulae obtained in an essentially different manner by M. Mention , Bull .
de l'Acad .
de St. Pet. t. i. pp. 15 , 30 and 507 ( 1860 ) , in reference to the case of the two circles ( it thereby appears that the decomposition takes place for the quadrangle and the hexagon ) ; and these formula are reproduced in the memoir .
