IN a former paper , inserted in the Philosophical TrIansactions , 1843 , Part I. , I detailed observations on some phenomena of elliptic polarization by reflexion from certain metallic surfaces ; but with reference only to one class of comparative results .
From these I have been led to pursue the subject into other relations besides those at first contemplated ; but , from various causes , have only been able at this interval to submit the results to the Royal Society as a sequel to my former observations .
The changes in the degree of ellipticity , investigated in my former paper , correspond to certain changes in the thickness of metallic flms .
If we now consider the case of reflexion from a simple polished metallic surface , and admit that in this case it may be supposed to take place by the penetration of the ray to a certain minute depth , or to some action of a thin transparent lamina of the metal , then , in like manner , -dependent on the law of metallic retardation , the effect would vary with a difference in the effective thickness of the lamina , produced by changing the inclination of the incident ray ; and that this is the case in general is well known , viz. that as the incidence is increased , the ellipticity increases up to a maximum , which occurs for most metals at an incidence between 700 and 80 ?
, beyond which it decreases up to 90 ? .
The original researches of Sir D. BREWSTER* , to which we are indebted for the first investigation of these phenomena , afford a striking instance of the legitimate process of inductive inquiry in its first stage , in their total exemption from all reference to any physical theory .
In these researches , besides the change in ellipticity with the incidence , there is also included the change in the virtual plane of polarization by metallic reflexion , which , though conjectured to be the same as that investigated by FRESNEL for transparent substancest , was only examined in detail at incidences at or near that for the maximum ellipticity , to which the author 's object immediately restricted him .
But for a series of metals constant arcs were accurately determined+ , which are the azimuths of polarization of the ray , restored to plane polarization after two reflexions from metal plates at the incidence for the maximum ; while the ellipse , from which the appellation of " elliptic polarization " was derived , is a purely emnpirical representation of the varying arcs of incidence , considered as radii , for the second reflexion to restore plane polarization , at all azimuths of the plane of second reflexion to the first .
Though the subject of metallic reflexion is still in a condition of great obscurity , as to the mechanical causes to which its peculiar character is referrible , yet the application of the undulatory theory at least enables us to trace and connect some of its laws , and in the attempt to pursue such an application to some further relations , the nature of my researches may be briefly explained as follows:1 .
So far as the objects of my former inquiry were concerned , it sufficed to take the-formula there employed for the polarized rings in the simplified form resulting from supposing a common coefficient to the two component vibrations ; the plane of original polarization inclined 450 to that of reflexion , and 90 ?
to that of analyzation .
With reference however to some of the facts connected with observations at different incidences and azimuths of the polarizer , as well as on other grounds , it seemed desirable to generalize that formula by removing the above-mentioned restrictions ; and I have accordingly here given an expression for the rings in elliptic light of all degrees with generial coefficients , and for all positions of the polalizer and analyzer ; which , though without difficulty deducible , has not , as far as I am aware , been stated by any writer .
2 .
With respect to the general character of the rings , the slightest observation shows that the distinction between the dark and bright centred systems in plane polarized light , though modjfied , is not lost , in the lower degrees of ellipticity ; it disappears only when the light becomes perfectly circular ; when the distinction is only seen in the changed direction of dislocation .
When the plane of analyzation is inclined 45 ?
between the rectangular directions , and generally in intermediate positions , the whole appearance is , as it were , distorted ; the dark arcs nearest the centre are situated towards one end of the quadrants , instead of being in the middle ; and in the succeeding rings , though less strongly marked , there is an apparent increase of intensity towards the same end of the quadrant , owing to a general shade of darkness in the ground towards that side* .
Of this appearance , though it must have been constantly seen , as far as I know , no explanation has been published .
In circular polarization it does not occur .
In plane polarized rings the analogous case is that of the well-known system of eight dislocated sectors ; which in ellipticity of lower degrees is combined with , and passes into , that just described .
All this is expressed by my formula .
3 .
The restoration of elliptic to plane polarized light by means of FRESNEL'S rhomb , and the determination of the ellipticity by the azimuth of the rhomb , though an obvious process , yet has not , as far as I know , been pursued for any series of metals .
Such a set of observations I have accordingly made at the incidence for the maximum ellipticity , for a considerable range of metals , some metallic ores , and other reflecting substances .
Also in a few principal cases I have made similar observations at other incidences from 80 ?
up to 30 ?
, at which the ellipticity disappears .
In these cases the metallic reflexion performs the part of the first rhomb in FRESNEL'S experiment with two .
If I rightly interpret Sir D. BREWSTER'S process for a similar restoration , before referred to , and if the two metal plates are analogous to the two rlhomnbs , in the change of plane , which he so accurately determined , after the second reflexion , at the maximum incidence , we may infer a correspondence with that produced in the rhomb ; and that it is equal to twice the azimuth of the rhomb .
And in fact I find the results from two such different methods agree very closely for all the pure metals ; though for certain ores , very low in the scale , there are some discrepancies .
There is also a close agreement between these results and the azimuths of the plane of the ray restored to plane polarization by the action of a crystallized plate , as given by the same author for some of the principal metals* , which confirms the same inference .
5 .
The changes of plane for successive incidences are in general of a nature analogous to those in the reflexion from transparent bodies , but not the same .
At the incidence for the maximum , if the plane of the polarizer be first adjusted to give , e. g. the dark system , then on changing its plane to 450 , the analyzer , in order to restole what is analogous to the same , that is , the darkest system , must coincide with the plane of incidence , or is azimuth is ?
, in exact agreement with what obtains both by theory and observation in the reflexion from transparent bodies .
At greater incidences , to restore the same system , the analyzer must be moved through increasing arcs on one side of the plane of incidence , and at lesser incidences on the other , as for transparent bodies .
Following up these latter , as the incidence is successively diminished , the azinuth of the analyzer changes in a manner obviously ent from that atwhich obtains for transparent bodies , though of the same general character : and the increase is slightly different for different metals ; but in all n cases it approaches 450 as the incidence approaches the perpendicular .
In these cases the azimuth of the polarizer remains at 45 ? .
If it be changed , that of the analyzer preserves a constant relation .
Though these observations are of an obvious nature , yet , as far as I know , none of the kind have been published for any series of netals .
I have accordingly given such a set for various reflecting substances .
But though apparently simple in prnciple , thse process is troublesome in practice , and affected by various causes of uncertainty and difficulty .
Some apparent anomalies , especially , which caused the arcs at small incidences to appear to increase beyond 45 ?
, for a long time caused me much perplexity .
The results however here offered , having been obtained with the use of every precaution , and being the means of a great number of repetitions , I trust , on the whole , may not be useless as a first attempt to determine these changes by direct observation .
6 .
The ellipticity at different incidences cannot be deduced ( except at the max* Philosophical Transactions , 1830 , Part II .
p. 311 .
271 imum ) from the rhomb observations without a knowledge of the change of plane : employing these latter data in combination with the former ( 3 .
) , I have further estimated the ellipticity at different incidences for four principal metals .
7 .
For the application of the undulatory theory to these phenomena , we ought to be able to assign the law of metallic retardation , but this has not yet been done .
The theory as here given indicates the conditions of the maximum , and shows in general a change , but not its amount .
Professor MACCULLAGH has however proposed , in accordance with a remarkable mathematical analogy , certain modifications of FRESNELS formula , which he has reduced to calculation in the case of steel .
My theoretical formula gives rise to an expression for the change of plane , but involving undetermined functions of the retardation .
On deducing the corresponding terms from Professor MACCULLAGH'S data , and introducing them into my formula , I fnd it gives a very close representation of the observed resultsfor steel .
Thus Professor MACCULLAGH'S empirical expression receives an additional confirmnation in accordance with a direct deduction from the undulatory theory .
The rest of this paper is devoted to the details of the observations , and of the analytical investigation .
THEORETICAL INVESTIGATION .
( 1 .
) The original vibration in a plane P being a sin T ( vt-x ) , in general on reflexion in a plane R inclined to P by an angle I ( R ' being the plane perpendicular to R ) it is resolved into a cos sin W ( vt-x ) ... in R , a sin e sin ( vt-x ) ... in R ' .
( 2 .
) But in the case of metallic reflexion , one of these components is accelerated in phase by a quantity f , and at the same time for the greater generality , supposing the coefficients unequal , or changing a in the 2nd formula to b , and writing for brevity -os=acos , b3=bsin ; after metallic reflexion the component vibrations will be sin((vt--x ) ) =R , v sin ( ^ h(t-t)+ f =Re ( 3 .
) Here we may remark that these formulas give directly the equation to the elliptic vibrations , the ratio of whose axes is that of ca to f3 , which vary at different incidences as well as with changes given to : ; or a and b are also functions of the incidence , or of .
When g=2 if a=p3 the light is circular ; this is never the case in any metal at the maximum , though in some the ratio approaches it .
For some other value of f we may have oa=- , but this does not give circular polarization .
When g=O the same formulas give the inclination of the plane of the rectilinear vibrations* .
( 4 .
) On interposing a plate of crystal cut perpendicular to its axis , for any plane Q in the crystal passing through the axis , inclined to R by an angle p , and to which Q ' is perpendicular , we have the vibrations R resolved into R sin p in Q ' Rcosp in Q. R ' resolved into R cos in Q R ' sin np in Q. ( 5 .
) And on the general principle of resolution ( observing that the resolved parts in one of the planes will be opposed ) , we have R ' sin P -R cos p=Q R ' cos pR sin =Q ' .
The vibrations in Q ' form the ordinary ray 0 , and those in Q the extraordinary E. But after emergence the vibrations in Q are all further accelerated by 0 , or become a sin ( - ) + ) , sin tl ( AVt-X)+H+ ) ( 6 .
) Thus we have t3sin( ( vt-x)+ ) cos p -=0 ... in Q ' .
-sin ( A(vt ) )sin p3 sin ( ( vt-x ) +-+ ) sin l , =E ... inQ .
+asin( ( vt-x)+O ) cos pJ ( 7 .
) Now if the analyzer be applied with the plane of analyzation A , inclined to R by an angle X , we shall have the angle AQ=-=X%-p , and AP=X+t .
The vibrations being again resolved in A and A ' perpendicular to it , we find 0 resolved into { sin 4 in A ' 0 cos 4 in A. E cos0in A ' E resolved into Ec si in AE sin inA .
After analyzation the parts transmitted are those only in A , or ' O cos -E sin 4/ .
On substituting the values of O and E , and arranging the terms , this is reducible to the form Hsin ( vt-))+ Kcos( ( vt -x ) ) ' where sin sin cocos f os H +3in sn sin si n sin sin -a cos p sin , cos 0 and [ cos. cos 4 sin g -sin p sin sin cosO K= K. --3 sin sin 4 cos sin 4 cos p sin sin J Then , since the intensity I at any part of the image is expressed by I=H2+K2 , ( 9 .
) Squaring these quantities H and K , and taking the sum , after reduction , we ultimately find for any value of X , or position of the analyzer , ( 32 cos2 p+a 2 sin2p ) cos24i 2 +(si2 sin2 +2 os2p ) sin2 , . !

( 10 .
) Or , in order to see the consequences of changing the position of the ainalyzer , or the arc % , we must introduce it by substituting for p its value ; =--- , r ( S2 sin2 ( X-4-)+32 cos2 ( X-4))cos2 4J+ ( z2 cos2 ( X-4.)+ !

This formula is general for all positions of the polarizer and analyzer , and for light of all degrees of ellipticity .
If we had taken ( as in my former paper ) 4=(45--p ) , and at the same time supposed a=3=lI ( which is equivalent to the assumption then made for simplification ) , the formula ( 9 .
) would become at once the same as in that paper .
The first terms independent of 0 express the intensity of the ground on which , as it were , the rings are formed : those involving g vary with the incidence or degree of ellipticity : those involving 0 give the rings ; the last only being retained when the ellipticity is a maximum , and disappearing for plane polarization at the incidence 0 .
From these formulas we at once trace all the well-known phenomena of the rings in plane and elliptic light , by following the changes in formula ( 9 .
) on advancing into the adjacent quadrants , or supposing -4 to become 4-+90 , and by consequence changing also p into &lt; p+90 ; which gives a change of sign in the terms involving sin 2- , cos 24 , , sin 2p , cos 2p .
Again , with regard to changes in the analyzer , it is evident that whatever be the value of X if we increase it by 900 , we shall have to substitute in ( 10 .
) cos ( X--4 ) for sin ( X-4 ) and vice versed ; as well as sin 2(x-4O ) for sin 2(x--O ) , and cos 2(--4 ) for cos 2(x--4 ) , or , on the whole , the expression is obviously complementary , except the last term .
( 13 .
) In any case on giving successive values to -4 round the rings , at those points where the sines or cosines vanish , the disappearance of any term when accompanied by a change of sign indicates ( so far as that term affects the total intensity ) a change from dark to bright at that point , or a complementary character in the adjacent portions of the image ; when without a change of sign it indicates a simple maximum orl minimum of light , in the rings or in the ground , according as the terms affected involve 0 or not ; and for light of different ellipticities according to the value of .
Thus for the values of X in general , in ( 11.)At 4=0 , or 90 ?
, terms 1 , 2 , 3 , for the ground disappear without change of sign .
8 , for the rings 4 , 6 , for the ground ) ... 4 , 6 , for the ground disappear with change of sign .
7 , 9 , for the rings J At 4= 45 , 5 , for the ground , disappears without change of sign .
4 , 6 , for the ground disappear with change of sign .
7 , for the rings In general then there are dislocations of the rings , with more or less complete complementary changes in the ground both at the quadrants and half-quadrants .
At the maximum ellipticity , since terms 5 , 6 , 7 , '8 disappear , there are dislocations only at %4=0 , with a change in the ground at -4=45 , or a gradual decrease of brightness from one end of the quadrant to the other , which is exactly the appearance obselved .
In plane polarized light we have the system of eight dislocated sectors , intermediate between the dark and bright systems .
In the lower degrees of ellipticity this is modified by , and passes into , that just described .
( 14 .
) We may illustrate the application of the formula by one or two particular cases:1 st. If we suppose at some incidence a=p3 while '2 ) then X=45 ?
will give branches with dislocation at 4=%0 ?
, but none at 4^= 450 ; that is the nearest approach to the dark system .
This agrees with formula ( 15 .
) , where in this case I is a minimum when Z=45 ?
, also with ( 18 .
) .
2ndly .
On the same supposition Z=0 will give complementary changes both in the ground and in the rings at 4=0 , and similar changes , though less conspicuous , at 4-=45 ; that is the intermediate system .
3rdly .
For the general values of a and 3 at the maximum cos g=0 ; and X=0 gives branches with dislocation at -0=O , but no change at ~=-45 ?
; or the darkest system .
But -=45 ?
will give ( since aj3 ) a complementary change in the ground at 4=45 ?
, and branches with dislocation at =O0 ; or the distorted system .
But if in this case a=3 , or the polarization be circular , the term ( 4 .
) disappears , and there is no distorted system in any position of X. Observation shows this to be the case in perfectly circulat light , and very nearly so in the higher degrees of ellipticity .
( 15 .
) For the branches , when , P=0 , for Z in general we have I=-2 sin2 X+P32 cos2 X M/ 3 sin 2P cos. Hence , on making successively cos g= 1 , cos g=0 , cos = --1 , &amp;c. , it is obvious that the intensity of the branches for the maximum ellipticity would be a mean between that in the dark and bright systems of plane polarized light if a and P were the same in the respective cases , which we shall see is the case ; at all events , this relation of the intensities agrees with observation as far as the eye can judge .
( 16 .
) Again , for the maximum ellipticity , I =32+(~2 -32 ) sin 2 X , which can never be =0 ; or the branches are never absolutely dark ; but it is evidently a minimum when X=0 , and a maximum when %=90 ?
, in which cases respectively I=P32 , or I=a2 .
If the polarization were circular these values would be equal , or the brightness the same in all positions of the analyzer .
( 17 .
) For incidence 0 ?
, the expression ( 15 .
) being made =0 , or , I=a2 sin2 %X+32 cos2 X2aj3 sin X cos %= 0 , we have for the position of the analyzer for absolutely dark branches , as in ( 3 .
) , asin x-3cos =0 , or tan = tan~ t.~b or tan ; =-tan ~ , But observation shows in this case that tan %=45 ?
when ==45 ?
in all instances , hence for incidence 0 ?
a=b .
( 18 .
) More generally , differentiating ( 15 .
) in respect of X , we find for any given value of , that is of a and j3 , the value of X for the minimum , or darkest branches , 2a3 cos tan 2 ; %-_ jv or we might deduce directly tan X=2 cos g / ( 1 + 422 2 cos2 Hence we may make the same inferences as before .
And if when cos g=O we have also c==p , or circular vibrations , it is worth while to observe that there results tan 2 -O But in general for the change of plane , or of X , this formula does not assign any precise values , since the form of the function of e involved in a and a is unknown .
-(19 .
) In the absence of any theoretical law I have had recourse to the empirical modification of FRESNEL'S formula proposed by Professor MACCULLAGH A. And availing myself of the computed values which he has given , in the case of steel , for the coefficients of the component vibrations a a ' ( assuming a'=P3 in my notation ) and the -retardations Y 6 ' ( where s-Y =g in my notation ) , I have deduced the values of the product a &amp; G , of ac2-'2 , and of cos g , and introducing these in formula ( 18 .
) , I find the resulting values of X in close agreement with those given by observation .
The elements of this computation and its results are exhibited in Table IV .
APPARATUS .
The general principle of my apparatus will be apparent from the nature of the experiments , but it .
lay not be superfluous ( especially for those who may wish to pursue similar observations ) to annex an outline of the construction , ' which , after trial of various formsln , I have found best to unite the requisite conditions for the purpose in view ; while it is readily convertible into an ordinary polariscope ; besides admitting of the addition or substitution of other parts , when required , for different objects .
The accompanying Plate II .
fig. 1 gives a general view of the arrangement and will sufficiently explain itself : the polarizing part ( P ) contains a NICOL prism which can be turned in azimuth , measured by a graduated circle ; a condensing lens ( L ) is also attached to it .
The analyzing patrt ( A ) contains in the eye-piece ( E ) a lens , a calc-spar , and a tourmnaline ; and bears a graduated circle , on which the azitnuth of analyzation is read off .
The metal under examination is placed on the support ( R ) , which can be raised or * Reports , Royal Irish Academy , October 1836 .
2 22 277 lowered as required ; and should be capable of a slight inclination for better`adjustment .
The middle part or hinge ( M ) is surrounded by a graduated vertical circle , by which the parts ( P ) and ( A ) can be set at any angle to each other : they are attached to it by projecting arms : the whole is moved by the joint ( K ) till the reflected light from ( R ) comes distinctly to the eye through ( E ) , when ( it is easily seen ) the angle of incidence will be hal/ that measured on ( M ) .
The zero of ( M ) is found by adjusting ( P ) and ( A ) with their axes in one line ( or reducing the instrument to an ordinary polariscope ) .
The hinge should be capable of being firmly clamped .
In observations at very great incidences it will be easily seen to be necessary to have the arms carrying ( P ) and ( A ) so fixed , that when the axes of the tubes are brought into one line there shall be a considerable space between their inner ends : there should be also a slight motion about the axis of the arm for adjustment in ( P ) .
In observations at very small incidences , it is most convenient to throw the light on to ( P ) by means of a small mirror placed in a proper position .
Fig. 2 represents the mode of applying the FRESNEL rhomb ( F ) to the analyzing part , the rest of the arrangement remaining the same .
The eye-piece ( E ) is removed to a cap on the top of the rhomb ; while the bottom of the rhomb is attached to a short tube , which fits into the aperture before occupied hy the eye-piece .
Fig. 3 represents the appearance of the rings in elliptic light when the analyzer is at 45 ?
between the dark and light systems .
OBSERVATIONS .
Thie determination of the precise position of the analyzer at which the maximuni or minimum brightness is attained , is from the nature of the case open to considerable uncertainty .
But the intervention of the rings , instead of using the simple analyzer , affords some aid in this respect , since the change in the nature and form of the rings offers a more ready guide to the eye ; especially in elliptic light , where there is never a total evanescence .
Still the undefined nature of the object observed precludes minute numerical accuracy , and the results in the following tables must be regarded as no more than approximations , though derived from the means of a great number of repetitions .
In taking these means , I have omitted fractions of a degree as bearing an appearance of accuracy quite illusory .
The greatest care is necessary in the adjustments , especially of the polarizer .
They were remade for each set of observations .
That for the polarizer to obtain the zero or coincidence with the plane of reflexion , was found by varying the azimuth till the light was perfectly restored to plane polarization ; the analyzer being in the position for dark branches , the zero of its circle was determined at the same time .
In the observations at different incidences , in order to secure the constancy of its inclination to the plane of incidence , the polarizer was adjusted to zero before observation at each incidence .
For some of the ores , &amp;c. which reflect but little light , the arcs must be taken as mere estimations .
I have found some peculiar discordances between different sets of observations , especially in silver and copper : those given are the means .
The observations here annexed in a tabular form consist of,1 .
Those with FRESNEL'S rhomb for ascertaining from the aziniuth ( y ) for the restoration of plane polarization , the ellipticity at the incidence for the maximum ; or giving = ( t any These results for the principal metals and other substances are seen in Table I. , columns 3 and 4 .
Again , in the observations with the rhomb at azimuth y , the plane of the emergent ray is inclined by 2y to the original plane .
In Sir D. BREWSTER'S experiments with two metal plates it is inclined 45+- .
The results are here compared in columns 1 and 2 , and sufficiently show that we have 45+- ? ?
72 for all the pure metals .
Also we may remark , that Sir D. BREWSTER'S empirical ellipse has the ratio of its axes determined by sin 2 p , and is therefore different from the undulatory .
The same author also gives* the azimuths of the plane of the ray restoled to plane polarization by a crystallized plate for several metals , as follows : Pure silver ... 42 ?

Observations for the values of X at successive incidences , while E remains at 45C .
These series of arcs are given in Table II .
, column 1 , for the two metals of greatest and least maximum ellipticity and two intermediate ; and in Table III .
for a number of others .
3 .
Observations for the ellipticity at different incidences .
In general the ellipticity is measured by the inclination of the rhornb ( y ) to the plane of previous polarization .
For the maximum ellipticity , since %=0 , it follows that y is correctly measured from the plane of reflexion .
But at other incidences y must be corrected by the change of plane of polarization due to that incidence , or we must take ( y-X ) .
In Table II .
( columns 2 and 3 ) are given the observed values of y for four principal metals at different incidences , and the corresponding ellipticities ( s ) or tan ( tr- ) .
These rlesults give on the whole a view of the changes of ellipticity agtleeing with the general appearance of the rings ; though in copper the diminution appears too rapid .

281 Received May 8 , 1845 .
Since the foregoing paper was communicated I have obtained some additional instances of elliptic polarization , which may be not uninteresting in connexion with those therein mentioned .
Besides plumbago ( in which the proportion of metal present is at least very variable and small ) I have now observed a slight , but quite unequivocal ellipticity in the reflexion from China ink , which is wholly non-metallic .
It is at its maximuni at an incidence of 62 ?
, and its azimuth of restoration by the rhomb is about 5 ? .
I have examined also chromate of lead , which gives very small ellipticity , which is at a maximum at an incidence of 70 ?
( agreeing well with the mean refractive index ) , and the azimnuth of the horrb is about 6 ? .
