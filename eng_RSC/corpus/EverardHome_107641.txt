On the double Organs of Generation of the Lamprey , the Conger Eel , the common Eel , the Barnacle , and Earth Worm , which impregnate themselves ; though the last from copulating , appear mutually to impregnate one another .
By Sir EVERARD HOME , Bart. V. P. R. S. Read February 27 , 1823 .
IN May , 180o6 , I was so fortunate as to ascertain that the Teredines are hermaphrodites , and that the same individual both formed and impregnated the ova .
In June , 1815 , I found the lamprey also to be an animal of the same tribe ; and on the present occasion , I wish to explain that the conger eel , the common eel , and the barnacle , are similar in their mode of generation , every one of these animals impregnating itself .
With respect to eels , I am disposed to agree in the opinion of the President of the Society , believing the conger and common eel to belong to the same species ; and that the only difference between them is the one living in fresh , the other in salt water , which will explain the difference in their size and colour .
What renders this probable is , that Sir H. DAVY succeeded in getting a fresh water eel to live in salt water ; and he understands that , after the eel has been accustomed to salt water for a year , its colours gradually change , acquiring a tint of green .
The experiment was carried on in Cornwall , and the eel was sent alive , that we might have the opportunity of judging for ourselves ; but it never arrived in London .
He began with young small eels , which all died ; when however he took one of a tolerable size , it seemed to suffer little inconvenience .
The organs of generation in the conger and common eel are exactly similar ; and I have been so fortunate , on the first of February , 1823 , to receive a conger from Plymouth , with ova distinctly visible in the microscope , and the structure of the testicles equally apparent .
Out of three congers sent to me , this state of the ova was only met with in one , so that they do not breed regularly in the same month .
As this has not , I believe , been noticed before , I got Mr. BAUER to represent the parts in the annexed drawing , and thought it might be satisfactory to the Society to see a magnified drawing of these double organs in the lamprey , where they are brought closer upon one another by the absence of an air bladder , on the sides of which the ovaria of the common eel and conger are spread .
In the eel tribe the kidneys are immediately behind the peritonaeum , and so closely connected with the testicle , when the eels are not caught in the breeding season , that the whole mass has been taken for kidney ; and had I not been favoured with the assistance of Mr. BAUER and Mr. CLIFT , I might have failed in procuring such accurate and distinct representations of these parts .
Mr. CLIFT , upon a former occasion , made a drawing of the testicles and ovarium of the lamprey , in which the parts were only sufficiently enlarged to identify the facts they were intended to demonstrate .
I have now , to:establish them more completely , taken advantage of Mr. BAVER 's superior skill in 141 the use of the microscope to give , upon the same plate , the ovarium of the lamprey , and of the conger ; wishing in my demonstration of such curious facts , that had escaped the accurate observation of JOHN HUNTER , they should , as far as may be , speak for themselves .
That species of barnacle , called Lepas Anatifera , has been examined , and drawings have been made of it by both these great anatomists , HUNTER and CUVIER ; but their not having met with it in the breeding season , prevented them from seeing the manner in which the ova are disposed of , and led to considerable error with respect to the organs of generation .
The ovaria are situated round the oesophagus , and may , when not met with in the breeding season , be mistaken for the salivary glands ; and the penis may be looked upon as the oviduct for depositing the ova after impregnation .
The curious circumstance in this species of lepas is , that the ova are impregnated before they leave the ovaria , by the point of the penis being bent down and carried for nearly one-fourth of an inch into them .
After impregnation , the ova pass through a small opening in the outer covering into the stem by which the body of the barnacle is suspended ; in that situation the ova are both defended and supplied with salt water ; and , when the embryo is completely formed , it makes its way out , laterally from the stem , leaving behind the shell or covering of the egg attached to the inside of the tube , marking the place from which it escaped , the young lepas acquiring a stem of its own .
In some cases the eggs all remain at the root of the stem , and come out externally , just opposite the opening in the outer covering .
149 All these circumstances are most distinctly illustrated by the drawings .
On the Organs of Generation of the Earth Worm .
It is now six years since Mr. BAUER very kindly offered me his assistance in this enquiry .
Our joint labours have been frequently interrupted by subjects of more interest ; we have , however , at last completed this investigation , and so much is represented in the drawings , that little is left for verbal description .
The mode of copulation resembles that of the leech more than of the snail ; but when the animals are separated there is this curious difference : in the leech , an animal much smaller than the earth worm , there remains protruded a penis an inch long ; a little lower down on the belly is the orifice leading to the uterus or ovarium ; so that the first impression I received was , that the length of the penis enabled the leech to copulate with itself , till my friend , Dr. JoHNsoN , laid before the Society an account of its copulation with another individual , which he had seen .
When two worms in copulation are forced asunder , there is upon neither of them any appearance of penis or vagina .
There is a pair of longitudinal slits or suckers a little way from the head on each side of the belly of both worms ; lower down a pair of hooks corresponding to each pair of suckers .
Their mode of copulation is as follows : Two worms come out of two neighbouring holes a few inches apart , so that there is sufficient space for them to copulate , and for one-third of the length of each worm to remain 143 in the hole , which enables them to keep their hold of the ground ; and whenever they are disturbed , they pull themselves asunder and retreat into their holes .
In the act of copulation , as in the leech , the heads lie in opposite directions , so that the hooks of one worm attach themselves to the suckers of the other , which at that time swell out exceedingly , and form a cavity which is filled with mucus .
The act of copulation is continued for a considerable time ; Mr. BAUER has watched them for several hours before they separated .
The testicles and ovaria ( in the breeding season ) are shown in the annexed drawings to be very conspicuous in each individual worm ; and although no canal from the one to the other has been detected , there can be no doubt that , the semen of the testicles arrives at the ovaria by the coats giving way .
The ova , after impregnation , are conveyed into cells , of which there are two rows on each side of the animal , and there deposited .
It is in this situation the ova are hatched ; and the young are for some time nourished by a substance supplied from a corrugated canal shown in the drawing , which is met with in the intestine , but having no communication with its cavity ; this corrugated canal is firmly attached posteriorly to the parts behind the intestine , and sends off tubes to each of the cells in which the young are hatched : there is also an external orifice leading into each of them .
In these cells the young go into the crysalis state , and when the young worm is ready to leave the crysalis covering , which is of an oval form , pointed at each end , one or more of these pointed ends are thrust out at the external orifice , so as to appear externally , like so many feet for the progressive motion of the worm .
The young worm does not remain immured till the crysalis covering is expelled , but eats its way out , leaving the middle broadest part of this covering sticking in the external orifice .
The total absence of penis and vagina makes it difficult to explain what purpose is answered by the copulation ; from the agitation produced by it through the whole of the bodies of the two worms , it seems necessary to distribute the ova to the numerous decipimenta in which they are met with .
This is somewhat different from the leech , whose ova are deposited in lateral cells , and are squeezed out at lateral orifices , covered with a mass of mucus , which at first encloses the whole leech .
The animal disengages its head by means of the teeth , and then , by the wriggling of the body , escapes , leaving the mass of eggs and mucus curled up with a hole through it in the form of a ball , which the leech deposits upon the water , and there the young go through the crysalis state , and eat their way out and provide for themselves .

Fig. 3 .
The upper portion of the same parts ; magnified four diameters .
In the middle line lies the great artery and the six lateral cells carrying red blood , and communicating between the great arterial and trunk , and the venal one on the opposite side or belly : the artery passes up to the head on the outside of the glandular mass surrounding the oesophagus , and through the space between the three portions of which the brain is composed , to go down the opposite or belly side of the animal .
Immediately on the outside of the three lowest arterial cells are the ovaria and testicles .
As the animal is divided through its whole length by decipimenta into compartments , one ovarium and one testicle lies on each side of the same compartment with the fourth arterial cell , and one testicle and ovarium in the same compartment with the fifth .
In the sixth , there is an ovarium but no testicle .
In the compartment below the arterial cells is one ovarium on each side very much developed , and directly between them is a hard cartilaginous circle , through which the oesophagus passes .
146 The other compartments contain membranous bags for the reception of ova .
The two lowest ovaria are hanging loose .
Before the breeding season they are empty .
Towards the lower part , on each side , is the cut edge of the lateral slit , by means of which the animals adhere in the act of copulation .
In this space are included six compartments : in each of these is a large conspicuous gland of an oval form .
The course of the oesophagus , crop , gizzard , and intestine , can be traced behind the great artery .

At the upper part is seen the brain , on each side of which go down two nervous elongations from two spherical ganglions situated on the opposite side to form the spinal marrow , which in this animal runs along the belly .
The spinal marrow is traced through its course , showing the artery belonging to its coats .
Many parts already described are seen in this view .
The lower developed ovaria appear in this view suspended upon the decipimentum .
Immediately below them the termination of the oesophagus is seen , under which is the crop , then the gizzard , leading to the intestine .

The EARTH WORM .
Fig. i. The same section as fig. 2 , Plate XVII .
magnified two diameters , showing the more internal parts for which purpose the spinal marrow is turned on one side : the intestine is laid open , exposing an hexangular tube , which has no communication with the intestine itself , but is posteriorly attached to that canal , and has two lateral openings into each compartment , showing the hexangular tube to be a reservoir of nutriment for the young .
Fig. 2 .
A posterior view of the outside of a portion of the intestine ; magnified eight diameters .
Upon this portion of intestine are seven partial contractions formed by the transverse decipimenta , between each of which are two orifices leading to the lateral membranous bags from the hexagonal tube .
Between the two rows of openings is a longitudinal passage , forming a communication between the ovaria and the cells in the different compartments .

In the second ring from the top are two hemispherical protuberances with transverse slits .
148 In the eleventh ring are two protuberances , from which , during copulation , two spoon-like suckers are projected , but at other times withdrawn .
At the eighteenth ring begin the longitudinal lateral slits , and they are continued to the twenty-second .
These are shown in an expanded state , in which they are only met with at the moment of the coitus .
In this view the openings from the compartments are distinctly seen .
On the middle line of the belly are two rows , and other two rows on each side ; these last are only distinctly seen in this drawing where the crysales are projecting through them .
