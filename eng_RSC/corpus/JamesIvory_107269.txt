On the Attractions of homogeneous Ellipsoids .
By James Ivory , A. M. Communicated by Henry Brougham , Esq. F. R. S. Read June 15 , 180g .
i. THE theory of the figures of the planets involves in it two distinct researches .
In the first of these , it is required to determine the force with which a body , of a given figure and density , would attract a particle of matter , occupying any proposed situation : in the second , the subject of investigation is the figure itself , which a mass of matter , wholly or partly fluid , would assume , by the joint effect of the mutual attraction of its particles , and a centrifugal force arising from a rotatory motion about an axis .
To render the second of these inquiries more exactly conformable to what actually takes place in nature , the influence of the attractions of the several bodies , that compose the planetary system , ought to be superadded to the forces already mentioned .
It is the first of these two researches , of which we propose to treat at present ; and we shall even confine our attention to homogeneous bodies , bcunded by finite surfaces of the second order .
The theory of the attractions of spherical bodies is delivered by Sir ISAAC NO :WTON in the first book of the Principia/ * In the same place the illustrious author lays down a method for ' 1 Sect. Iz .
determining the attractions of round bodies ( or such as are generated by the revolving of a curve about a right line which remains fixed ) when the attracted point is situated in the common axis of the circular sections : and he employs this method to compute the attractive force of a spheroid of revolution on a point placed in the axis.jt MACLAURIN was the first who determined the attractions of such a spheroid generally , for any point placed in the surface , or within the solid .
The method of investigation , invented by that excellent geometer , is synthetical , but original , simple , and elegant , and has always been admired by mathematicians .
When the attracted point is placed without the solid , the difficulty of solving the problem is greatly increased ; and it was reserved for LE GENDRE to complete the theory of attractions of spheroids of revolution , by extending to all points , whether without or within the solid , what had before been investigated for the latter case only.* LA PLACE took a more enlarged view of the problem ; he extended his researches to all elliptical spheroids , or such solids whose three principal sections are all ellipses ; and he obtained conclusions with regard to them , similar to what MACLAURIN and LE GENDRE had before demonstrated of spheroids of revolution .
In this more general view of the problem , the investigation is particularly difficult , wheml the attracted point is placed without the solid .
The method of investigation , which LA PLACE has employed for surmounting the difficulties of this last case , although it is entitled to every praise for its ingenuity , and the mathematical skill which it displays , is certainly neither so simple nor so direct , as to leave no room for perfecting the theory of the attractions of ellipsoids in both these respects .
It consists in showing that the expressions for the attractions of an ellipsoid , on any external point , may be resolved into two factors ; of which , one is the mass of the ellipsoid , and the other involves only the excentricities of the solid and the co-ordinates of the attracted point : whence it follows , that two ellipsoids , which have the same excentricities , and their principal sections in the same planes , will attract the same external point with forces proportional to the masses of the solids .
This theorem includes the extreme case , when the surface of one of the solids passes through the attracted point : and by this means the attraction of an ellipsoid , upon a point placed without it , is made to depend upon the attraction which another ellipsoid , having the same excentricities as the former , exerts upon a point placed in the surface.* LE GENDRE has given a direct demonstration of the theorem of LA PLACE , by integrating the fluxional expressions of the attractive forces ; a work of no small difficulty , and which is not accomplished without complicated calculations.t In the Mecanique Celeste , te subject of attractions of ellipsoids is treated by LA PLACE after the method first given by himself in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences , ' founded on the theory of series and partial fluxions .
It was in the study of LA PLACE'S work , that the method I am about to deliver , was suggested ; and it will not be altogether unworthy of the:notice of the Royal Society , if it contribute to simplify a branch of physical astronomy of great difficulty , and which has so much engaged the attention of the most eminent mathematicians .
o. Let a , b , c , be three co-ordinates , that determine the position of a point attracted by a solid : and let dM denote a molecule , or element of the mass of the solid , whose position is fixed by the co-ordinates xr , z , respectively parallel to a , b , c : then , supposing the invariable density to be denoted by unity , if we putf = ( a x ) ' + ( b y )a ( c -z ) } the distance of the molecule from the attracted point , the direct attraction of the molecule on the point will be =- .
This force of attraction is next to be decomposed into other forces , having fixed directions independent on the position of the attracting molecule ; and the directions most naturally suggested for this purpose , are the three axes respectively parallel to the co-ordinates .
When the direct attraction is thus decomposed , the resulting forces , acting parallel to the axes , and directed to the planes from which the co-ordinates are reckoned , will be respectively , dM(a-parallel to the axis of x a(-parallel to the axis ofp , dM-- ) parallel to the axis of y , P7fF ' dM(c-z)parallel to the aXis of z Let A denote the accumulated amount of all the attractions , parallel to the axis of x ; and , in like manner , let B and C denote the same things for the attractions parallel to the axes ofy and z : then , by restoring the value off , and writing dx .

Thus A is integrable with respect to x : Let x ' be the greatest value of x ( y and z remaining constant ) on the positive side of the plane of y and z , and x " the greatest value , on the negative side of the same plane ; then , the integration being performed , we shall get A =ffdy .

In like manner , if B and C be integrated ; the first with respect to the variable y , and the second with respect to the variable z ; two new expressions of these attractions will be obtained , exactly similar to the expression for A , that has just been investigated .

The general equation of a surface of the second order bounding a finite solid , is* k+ k ' + k " t1 t if the three quantities k , k ' , k " be supposed to be all equal , them the solid will be a sphere ; if two of them , as k ' and k " be equal , it will be a solid of revolution ; and if all the three be unequal , it will be an ellipsoid , or a spheroid , having all its three principal sections ellipses .
In what follows , we shall always suppose that k is the least of the three quantities k , k ' , k " , or the least of the semi-axes of the solid .
The general equation of the ellipsoid , will be satisfied by putting x=k cos p , yk sin. p cos. , and z= k " sin. pp sin. 4 ' ; where p and 4t denote two indeterminate angles .
In order to substitute these values of x , y , and z in the formula ( ) , we must begin with taking the fluxion of y , on the sup ?

To obtain a further transformation of the last expression of A , we are now to determine the semi-axes of an ellipsoid , whose surface shall pass through the attracted point , and which shall have the same excentricities , and its principal sections in the same planes , as the given ellipsoid .
Let h , h ' , h " be the semi-axes required : then , because the attracted point is to be in the surface of the solid , + h'+ " and , because the excentricities must be equal to those of the given ellipsoid , therefore h'h I k"Z k~ == e , and h"'--hA k " - .

For , by taking h small enough , the function on the left hand side will become greater than any positive quantity how great soever ; and by taking h great enough , the same function will become less than any positive quantity how small soever : and while h increases from o , ad hijinitum , the function continually decreases from being infinitely great to be infinitely little .
Therefore there is only one ellipsoid , having the required conditions , whose surface will pass through the attracted point.* When h is determined , then h ' = v/ h +e , h " / h + e ' : and in consequence of the equation , a bz cz h " + " Jr ~1 ) we may suppose , ah cos. n , b =h sin. m cos. n , c= h " sin. m sin. n.

In these values of A and A ' , it is plain that the quantities h , h ' , h " are alike concerned with the quantities k , k ' , and k " : and hence , by interchanging the semi-axes of the two ellipsoids , we may represent each of the expressions for A and A ' in two forms , which , when expanded , are identical : thus A { _ I ( h cos. m-k cos. 4p ) ' + ( h'sin .

Therefore , if we put A'= h'h"fs ; in .
) cos..d d.dt{ } : then will A ' ( when the double fluent is taken between the same limits as in the case of A ) be equal to the attractive force which the ellipsoid of homogeneous matter , whose semi-axes are .
, h ' , h " , exerts on the point , whose co-ordinates are k cos. m , k ' sin. m cos. n , k " sin. m sin. n , or a ' , b ' , c ' , in the direction parallel to the axis h. For , in the formula for A , as the fluxion under the sign of double integration , denotes the attractive force of an indefinitely small prism of the matter of the ellipsoid , whose semi-axes are k , k ' , k " upon the point whose co-ordinates are a , b , c , in the direction parallel to k and h ; so , for the like reasons , in the formula for A ' , the fluxion under the same sign , will denote the attractive force of an indefinitely small prism of the matter of the ellipsoid , whose semi-axes are h , h ' , h " , upon the point whose co-ordinates are a ' , b ' , c ' : and therefore the two fluents , when extended to all the prisms that compose the ellipsoids , will denote the attractions of the whole masses upon the respective points , in the direction mentioned .
Thus the attractions A and A ' depend upon the same fluent , and they are manifestly in the same proportion as k ' k " is to h ' h " .
And if we denote by B ' and C ' the attractive forces which the ellipsoid of homogeneous matter , whose semi-axes are hh , h ' , h exerts on the point whose co-ordinates are a ' , b ' , c ' , in 3S54 the directions parallel to k ' and k " ; it may , in like manner , be shown , that the attractions B and B ' have the same proportion as kk " has to hh " ; and the attractions C and C ' , the same proportion as kk ' to hh ' .
The points in the surlfaces of the two ellipsoids , which are determined by the co-ordinates , h cos. m , h ' sin. m cos. n , h ' " sin. m sin. n , or a , b , c , and k cos. m , k ' sin. m cos. in , k " sin. n sin. n , or a ' , b ' , c ' , may not improperly be called corresponding points of the surfaces : they are such points as are situated on the same sides of the planes of the principal sections , and have their co-ordinates respectively proportional to the axes to which they are parallel .
This being premised , the result of the foregoing investigation may be enunciated , as in the following theorem : " If two ellipsoids of the same homogeneous matter have ' the same excentricities , and their principal sections in the " same planes ; the attractions which one of the ellipsoids ex"erts upon a point in the surface of the other , perpendicularly to the planes of the principal sections , will be to the attrac " tions which the second ellipsoid exerts upon the corresponding point in the surface of the first , perpendicularly to the " same planes , in the direct proportion of the surfaces , or " areas , of the principal sections to which the attractions are " perpendicular."P For the principal sections , being ellipses , their areas are proportional to the products of the semi-axes .
When the attracted point , of which the co-ordinates are a , b , c , is placed without the ellipsoid having k , k ' , k " for its semiaxes ; then the point , of which a ' , b , c ' are the co-ordinates , is necessarily within the other ellipsoid : and , on account of the : relation which has been s1ewn to take'place between the at .
tractions of the two solids upon corresponding points in one another 's surfaces , the case , when the attracted point is placed witout an ellipsoid is made to depend upon the case , when the attracted point is within the surface .

Let us now consider the formula ( 2 ) for the attractive force parallel to the axis k , A=fJ'dy d{Aon the supposition that the attracted point is within the ellipsoid .
If a=o ( that is , if the attracted point be in the plane ofy and z ) then -i o , for all values of x , y , and z : and , in this case , the whole attractive force A is evanescent , as it ought to be .
For all other values of a , the expression J J^ in the circumstances supposed , is plainly a finite positive quantity : and , therefore , supposing b and c to be constant , and a to increase , we must infer that the attractive force A will receive finite increments , so long as the point determined by the co-ordinates a , b , c , is within the ellipsoid .
If this point be in the surface , then the variable ordinates x , y , z , when they belong to points indefinitely near to the attracted point , will approach indefinitely to an equality with a , b , c ; and the corresponding values of , and , consequently , the fluxions of the force A , will become infinitely great ; on which account the continuity of the function A is broken off From'what has now been observed , it follows , that we may substitute for the force A , its expansion in a series of the powers of a , provided we are careful not to extend the conclusions obtained by reasoning from the nature of such series , to the case when the attracted point is without the surface of the ellipsoid .
Let t -x + ( b --y ) + ( c -z ) , then A{ Rf +a ( a_)X ) Al= { R'+a(a+ sx ) } : and , if the fiunction .
, be expanded into a series , the terminius generalis of that series will be 4_.3.*5.7 * ... .a"'(a + zx)"an ( axz 2.4.6.8. .

K.-h and , hence it is plain , that all the even powers of a will disapappear , and only the odd powers will remain .
Now , the expansion of the force A cannot contain any of the powers of a , excepting those which enter into the series for - , : therefore , supposing the expansion of A to be .
arranged according to the powers of a , it will necessarily be of this form , viz. A=A t ) a qA3)a a3 +A(7 ) a +- , &amp;c. : where A('1 , A( : ) , A(s , &amp;c. are functions independent of a. The first of these coefficients , it is easy to prove , will be determined by this formula , iA'0Z =/ .d"y .
d ( 4 ) C b-b-yl2 41 and , with regard to the rest , they may be all shown to depend on A( ' ) , in consequence of an equation in partial fluxions , first noticed by LA PLACE , and derived from the nature of the functions under consideration .

In consequence of the equation of the solid , R is a function of the angles p and q : therefore , makingp only variable,.we shall have -dy= { ( d ) sin.p +R cos.p}cos .

This equation has two roots , viz.

It is remarkable , that the last expression of A( ' ) does not contain either of the quantities b or c ; for these do not enter into the function M : and hence we are to conclude that the value of A( ' ) is independent on these co-ordinates , and is the same for all points situated within the same principal section of the ellipsoid .
Another inference is , that all the other coefficients A3 ) , A5 ) , &amp;c. of the expansion of the force A are severally equal to o , as is plain from the law which connects those quantities with one another , and with A( ) ' : on this account the expansion alluded to will be reduced to its first term , .
and we shall have , simply , A_ A( ) x a. The same considerations likewise suggest a new analytical expression of A( ) ; which , on account of its simplicity , and its immediate dependence on the figure and equation of the solid , seems to deserve the preference to every other : for , since it has been shown that the value of A( ' ) is independent on the co ?

When the attracted point is without the ellipsoid , it becomes necessary , in the first place , to determine the semi-axes of another ellipsoid whose surface shall pass through the attracted point , and which shall have the same excentricities and its principal sections in the same planes , as the given ellipsoid .
these semi-axes have been denoted by h , h ' , h " , and the formulas for computing them have already been given.* We must next determine the co-ordinates of the point in the surface of the given ellipsoid , that corresponds to the attracted point in the surface of the other ellipsoid : and , according to the definition that has been given of them , these co-ordinates , k k ' denoted by a ' , b ' , c ' are thus found ; a ' =ax - ; b ' b x ; c Cx r.t These things being determined , the attractions of the ellipsoid whose semi-axes are h , h ' , h " , upon the point whose co-ordinates are a ' , b ' , c ' ( which is plainly within the solid ) are as follows : k 2rr dy ' .

If we examine the expressions ( 5 ) for the attractions of an ellipsoid upon a point placed within the surface , it will readily appear that the coefficients , into which the co-ordinates of the attracted point are multiplied , are homogeneous functions of o dimensions of the semi-axes of the solid , these quantities rising to the same dimensions in the numerators of the functions , as in the denominators : and hence it is easy to infer , that the values of these coefficients depend only on the proportions of the semi-axes to one another , and not at all upon their absolute magnitudes .
Therefore , if we conceive two ellipsoids of the same homogeneous matter , similar to one another and similarly placed , whose surfaces envelop the same attracted point ; it is plain , from what has just been remarked , that the attractions of these ellipsoids upon the point will be precisely equal .
Thus it appears , that the matter in .
closed between the surfaces of the two solids , does not alter the attractive force of the inner ellipsoid ; which could not be thecase , unless the attraction of thie superadded a tter in .
any one direction were Irecisely equal to the attraction of the same matter in the contrary direction , so as to produce an eqtuilibrium .
of opposing forces .
Hence we may extend to a shell of honmogeneous mratter , bounded by any finite surfaces of the second order , which are similar to one another and similarly placed , what Sir ISAAC NEWTON has demonstrated in the like hypothesis for surfaces of revolution ; * as in the following theorem : " If a point be situated within a shell of homogeneous matt " ter , bounded by two finite surfaces of the second order , " which are similar and similarly placed ; then the attraction " 'of the matter of the shell upon the point , in any one direcc tion , will be equal to , and destroy , the attraction of the same s matter , in the opposite direction .

Nothing more is wanting to complete a theory of the attractions of homogeneous ellipsoids , than to integrate the fluxional expressions ( 5 ) already obtained .

k. Therefore 3A 4~ 3 The same reasoning , it is evident , will apply to the remaining attractions ]B and C : and hence the attractions of a sphere upon a point within the surface , acting perpendicularly to the planes of any three great circles that intersect at right angles , are thus expressed , A=-a xT B --b x3C= c. These three forces compose a force , directed to the centre of the sphere , and equal to 4xV 2 : it is therefore directly proportional to the distance from the center .
For a pointt without the surface of a sphere , we have h h ' h " -Va 6 ' + c- : hence it is easy to infer , that the formulas ( 6 ) will become , 43A 3a 3 ax MA~a ( , + b+ c2 ) ( a2 +--b + c ) Bbx bxM B( a2 + b6 + c2 ) = ( a2 +2+ c2 C2 ) C3 cxM Cc x -3_ 1-- .

k= the mass of the sphere .
These three 3M forces compose a force = ; 7 , directed to the center : this force is , therefore , directly as the mass , and inversely as the square of the distance from the center of the sphere .
For an ellipsoid in general , we have x=k cos. q , y = k ' sin. q cos. yl , =k " sin. p sin. 4J : in order to transform the formulas ( 5 ) , we must first compute the values of die .

In the general case of the problem , the expressions that have been obtained transcend the limits of the ordinary analysis ; and their integration requires the introduction of other quantities besides algebraic expressions and circular arcs and logarithms .
They belong to the class of elliptical transcendants ; a branch of the mathematics which has been very successfully cultivated , and is fertile in resources and.methods that are applicable to every particular instance .
The fluents in the formulas ( 6 ) for a point without the surface , are derived from the ellipsoid whose semi-axes are h , h ' , h " , in the same manner as the fluents already considered are derived from the given ellipsoid : and , because bkkk is equal to the mass of the latter solid , divided by the mass of the formrer one , it is easy to infer that we have only to substitute h for k in the flu .
nts of the formulas ( 7 ) , to obtain the expressions of the attractions of the given ellipsoid upon a point without the surface .
Thus the two cases , when the attracted point is within the solid or in the surface , and when it is without the solid , differ only in the limits of the fluents : in the former case , the fluents , beginning when the variable quantity is infinitely great , are to be extended till it has decreased , so as to be equal to the least of the semi-axes of the given ellipsoid ; and , in the latter case , the fluents are to be extended only till the variable quantity has decreased , so as to be equal to h , the least of the semi-axes of the ellipsoid , whose surface passes through the attracted point .
In the former case , the values of the fluents are the same for all points within the ellipsoid , and in its surface ; in the latter case , these values depend upon the position of the attracted point .
The preceding formulas , being founded on the most general hypothesis , are applicable to all figures bounded by finite surfaces of the second order .
The case of the sphere , which corresponds to the supposition that the excentricities e ' and el are both evanescent , has already been considered , and , as it is attended with no difficulty , it needs not be again discussed ; 3 9^ but the two cases of solids of revolution , that of the oblate and oblong spheroids , are deserving of particular attention .
In the oblate spheroid , the two greater semi-axes k ' and ki " are equal to one another ; and , therefore , it corresponds to the supposition of e e ' " .
In this case the formulas ( 7 ) will become.^dk A=3.gaMJ3a,.Jkz ( k. + ea ) , _ ?

t as I ex res d The formulas express the attractions of an oblate spheroid upon a point within the surface or in it , acting parallel to a , b , c , the co-ordinates of that point , of which a is parallel to the axis of revolution .
When the attracted point is without the surface , we have only to compute h , the semi-axis of revolution of the spheroid , whose surface passes through the attracted point , and to substitute it for k in the last formulas , in order to have the expressions of the attractions sought : and it is to be remarked , that the equation for finding h , which in the general case of the 37o ellipsoid rises to the third degree , is , in this case , depressed to a quadratic .
In effect , the equation for h , * when e2 e " , becoomes a2 bz + Cs " '+ eb ' -~ whence dh " ( a2 + b2 + c2 e2 ) 12 = a2 e , and so 2h2 =a +t2 e2 + V/ ( 2+ b2 + C2e)2+ 4a el .
In the oblong spheroid , one of the semi-axes k ' and k " must be made equal to the least semi-axis k , which corresponds to the suppposition of e'2 = o. In this case , the formulas ( 7 ) will become A= 3aM f.J-k B -=bM .
C=3cM f Tdk C 3cM 3 ( k e2 ) e In these expressions k is the radius of the equatorial circle of the spheroid , and not the semi-axis of revolution , which is = V/ 2 + e2 : and if we change k to denote the semi-axis of revolution , which requires that V/ k e ' be substituted for k ; and , for the sake of uniformity with the formulas for the oblate spheroid , likewise interchange a and b , and A and B , in order that a may denote the ordinate parallel to the axis of revolution , and that A may express the attractive force in the siame direction ; then , the last expressions will become A= 3aM./ kd B= 3bM.f(kJ C 3cMPage Page 351 .

When the attracted point is without the spheroid , we must first compute h , the semi-axis of revolution of the spheroid , whose surface passes through the attracted point ; and for this purpose we have the following expression , viz. 2h2 = a2 ++ c2 +2+/ 24 2+ e/ .a2 I -4a2 e observing that a is the ordinate parallel to h : then the attractions required will be found merely by substituting h for k in the formulas for the case when the attracted point is within the spheroid . ?
