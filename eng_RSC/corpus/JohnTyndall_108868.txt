THE Royal Society has already done me the honour of publishing in the Philosophical Transactions three memoirs on the relations of radiant heat to the gaseous form of matter .
In the first of these memoirs* it was shown that for heat emanating from the blackened surface of a cube filled with boiling water , a class of bodies which had been previously regarded as equally , and indeed , as far as laboratory experiments went , perfectly diathermic , exhibited vast differences both as regards radiation and absorption .
At the common tension of one atmosphere the absorptive energy of olefiant gas , for example , was found to be 290 times that of air , while when lower pressures were employed the ratio was still greater .
The reciprocity of absorption and radiation on the part of gases was also experimentally established in this first investigation .
In the second inquiryt I employed a different and more powerful source of heat , my desire being to bring out with still greater decision the differences which revealed themselves in the first investigation .
By carefully purifying the transparent elementary gases , and thus reducing the action upon radiant heat , the difference between them and the more strongly acting compound gases was greatly augmented .
In this second inquiry , for example , olefiant gas at a pressure of one atmosphere was shown to possess 970 times the absorptive energy of atmospheric air , while it was shown to be probable that when pressures of 3-1th of an atmosphere were compared , the absorption of olefiant gas was nearly 8000 times that of air .
A column of ammoniacal gas , moreover , 3 feet long , was found sensibly impervious to the heat employed in the inquiry , while the vapours of many of the volatile liquids were proved to be still more opaque to radiant heat than even the most powerfully acting permanent gases .
In this second investigation , the discovery of dynamic radiation and absorption is also announced and illustrated , and the action of odours and of ozone on radiant heat is made the subject of experiment , The third paper* of the series to which I have referred was devoted to the examination of one particular vapour , which on account of its universal diffusion possesses an interest of its own-I mean of course the vapour of water .
In this paper I considered all the objections which had been urged against my results up to the time when the paper was written ; I replied to each of them by definite experiments , removing them one by one , and finally placing , as I believe , beyond the pale of reasonable doubt the action of the aqueous vapour of our atmosphere .
In this third paper , moreover , the facts established by experiment are applied to the explanation of various atmospheric phenomena .
I have now the honour to lay before the Royal Society a fourth memoir , containing an account of further researches .
Hitherto I have confined myself to experiments on radiation through gases and vapours which were introduced in succession into the same experimental tube , the heat being thus permitted to pass through the same thickness of different gases .
A portion of the present inquiry is devoted to the examination of the transmission of radiant heat through different thicknesses of the same gaseous body .
The brass tube with which my former experiments were conducted is composed of several pieces , which are screwed together when the tube is to be used as a whole ; but the pieces may be dismounted and used separately , a series of lengths being thus attainable , varying from 2'8 inches to 49'4 inches .
I wished , however , to operate upon gaseous strata much thinner than the thinnest of these , and for this purpose a special apparatus was devised , and with much time and trouble rendered at length practically effective .
Fig. 1 .
e/ 7/ ~ ~~~~ / , / &lt; ~ -y v ' " ../ --/ The apparatus is sketched in fig. 1 .
C is the source of heat , which consists of a plate of copper against the back of which a steady sheet of flame is caused to play .
The plate of copper forms one end of the chamber F ( the " front chamber " of my former memoirs ) .
This chamber , as in my previous investigations , passes through the vessel through which cold water continually circulates , entering at the bottom and escaping at thetop .
The heat is thus prevented from passing by conduction from the source C to the first plate of rock-salt S. This plate forms the end of the hollow cylinder A B , dividing it from the front chamber F , with which the cylinder AB is connected by suitable screws and washers .
Within the cylinder AB moves a second one , I I , as an air-tight piston , and the bottom of the second cylinder is stopped by the plate of rocksalt S ' .
This plate projects a little beyond the end of its cylinder , and thus can be brought into flat contact with the plate S. Fixed firmly to AB is a graduated strip of brass , while fixed to the piston is a second strip , the two strips forming a vernier , v v. By means of the pinion R , which works in a rack , the two plates of salt may be separated , their exact distance apart being given by the vernier .
P is the thermo-electric pile with its two conical reflectors ; C ' is the compensating cube , employed to neutralize the radiation from the source C. H is an adjusting screen , by the motion of which the neutralization may be rendered perfect , and the needle brought to zero under the influence of the two opposing radiations .
The graduation of the vernier was so arranged as to permit of the employment of plates of gas varying from 001 to 2 ' 8 inches in thickness .
They were afterwards continued with the pieces of the experimental tube , already referred to , and in this way layers of gas were examined which varied in thickness in the ratio of 1 : 4900 .
In my former experiments the chamber F was always kept exhausted , so that the rays of heat passed immediately from the source through a vacuum ; but in the present instance I feared the strain upon the plate S , and I also feared the possible intrusion of a small quantity of the gas under examination into the front chamber F , if the latter were kept exhausted .
Having established the fact that a length of 8 inches of dry air exerts no sensible action on the rays of heat , I had no scruple in filling the chamber F with dry air .
Its absorption was nil , and it merely had the effect of lowering in an infinitesimal degree the temperature of the source .
The two stopcocks c and c ' stand exactly opposite the junction of the two plates of salt S , S ' when they are in contact , and when they are drawn apart these cocks are in communication with the space between the plates .
After many trials , the following mode of experiment was adopted:-The gas-holder containing the gas to be examined was connected by an india-rubber tube with the cock cl , the other cock c being at the same time left open .
The piston was then moved by the screw R until the requisite distance between the plates was obtained .
This space being filled with dry air , the radiations on the two faces of the pile were equalised , and the needle brought to zero .
The gas-holder was now opened , and by gentle pressure the gas from the holder was forced first through a drying apparatus , and then into the space between the plates of salt .
The air was quickly displaced , and a plate of the gas substituted for it .
If the layer of gas possessed any sensible absorbing power , the equilibrium of the two sources of heat would be destroyed ; the source C ' would triumph , and from the deflection due to its preponderance the exact amount of heat intercepted by the gas could be calculated .
203 When oxygen , hydrogen , or nitrogen was substituted for atmospheric air , no change in the position of the galvanometer-needle occurred ; but when any one of the compound gases was allowed to occupy the space between the plates , a measurable deflection ensued .
The plates of rock-salt were not so smooth , nor was their parallelism so perfect as entirely to exclude the gas when they were in contact .
The contact was but partial , and hence a stratum of gas sufficient to effect a sensible absorption could find its way between the plates even when they touched each other .
On this account the first thickness in the following Tables was really a little more than 0*01 of an inch .
The first column in each contains the thickness of the gaseous layer , while the second column contains the absorption expressed in hundredths of the total radiation .
The first layer of carbonic oxide , for example , absorbed 0*2 , and the second layer 0'5 per cent. of the entire heat .

35'1 Sulphuric ether vapour , therefore , commences with an .
absorption much lower than that of olefiant gas , and ends with a higher absorption .
This is quite in accordance with the result established in my second memoir* , that in a short tube the absorption effected by the sparsely scattered molecules of a vapour may be less than that of a gas at a tension of an atmosphere , while in a long tube the gas may be exceeded by the vapour .
The deportment of sulphuric ether indicates what mighty changes of climate might be brought about by the introduction into the earth 's atmosphere of an almost infinitesimal amount of a powerful vapour .
And if aqueous vapour can be shown to be thus powerful , the effect of its withdrawal from our atmosphere may be inferred . ? ?

The experiments with the piston apparatus being completed , greater thicknesses of gas were obtained by means of the composite brass experimental tube already referred to .
The arrangement adopted was , however , peculiar , being expressly intended to check the experiments , which were for the most part made by my assistants .
The source of heat and the front chamber remained as usual ; a plate of rock-salt dividing , as in my previous investigations , the front chamber from the experimental tube .
The distant end of the tube was also stopped by a plate of salt ; but instead of permitting the tube to remain continuous from beginning to end , it was divided , by a third plate of rock-salt , Fig. 2../ E aSn9d .
Cham , CLham .
Fron tI Ch into two air-tight compartments .
Thus the rays of heat from the source had to pass through three distinct chambers , and through three plates of salt .
The first chamber was always kept filled with perfectly dry air , while either or both of the other chambers could be filled at pleasure with the gas or vapour to be examined .
For the sake of convenience I will call the compartment of the tube nearest to the front chamber the first chamber , the compartment nearest to the pile the second chamber ; the term 'front chamber ' being , as before , restricted to that nearest to the source .
The arrangement is sketched in outline in fig. 2 .
The entire length of the tube was 49 4 inches , and this was maintained throughout the whole of the experiments .
The only change consisted in the shifting of the plate of salt S ' which formed the partition between the first and second chambers .
Commencing with a first chamber of 2*8 inches long , and a second chamber 46-4 inches long , the former was gradually augmented , and the latter equally diminished .
The experiments were executed in the following manner:-The first and second chambers were thoroughly cleansed and.exhausted , and the needle brought to zero by the equalization of the radiations falling upon the opposite faces of the pile .
Into the first chamber the gas or vapour to be examined was introduced , and its absorption determined .
The first chamber was then cleansed , and the gas or vapour was introduced into the second chamber , its absorption there being also determined .
Finally , the absorption exerted by the two chambers acting together was determined , both of them being occupied by the gas or vapour .
The combination here described enabled me to check the experiments , and also to trace the influence of the first chamber on the quality of the radiation .
In it the heat was more or less sifted , and it entered the second chamber deprived of certain constituents which it possessed on its entrance into the first .
On this account the quantity absorbed in the second chamber when the first chamber is full of gas , must always be less than it would be if the rays had entered without first traversing the gas of the first chamber .
From this it follows that the sum of the absorptions of the two chambers , taken separately , must always exceed the absorption of the tube taken as a whole .
This may be briefly and conveniently expressed by saying that the sum of the absorptions exceeds the absorption of the sum .

Could I hate procured a sufficiently large quantity of gas in a single holder for an entire series of experiments it would not have been difficult to obtain concurrent results , but the slight variations in quality of the same gas generated at different times tell upon the results and render perfect uniformity extremely difficult to obtain .
The approximate constancy of the numbers in the third column is , however , a guarantee that the determinations are not very wide of the truth .
Irregularities , however , are revealed .
Some remarkable ones occur in the case of carbonic acid , with the chambers 23'8 and 2536 ; the absorptions in the first chamber varying in this instance from 11 ?
7 to 10*4 , and in the second chamber from 11'4 to 105 , and in both chambers from 13-1 to 12-0 .
The gas which gave the largest of these results was generated from marble and hydrochloric acid ; the next was obtained from chalk and sulphuric acid , and the gas which gave the smallest result was obtained from bicarbonate of soda and sulphuric acid .
The slight differences accompanying these different modes of generation made themselves felt in the manner recorded in the Table .

My friend Dr. FRANKLAND , for example , was kind enough to superintend for me the formation of a large holder of olefiant gas by the so-called " continuous process , " in which the vapour of alcohol is led through sulphuric acid diluted with its own volume of water ; the following results were obtained:208 iADIATION OF HEAT BY GASEOUS AND LIQUID MATTER .

This is the general character of the results as long as we adhere to the same gas .
Olefiant gas generated by mixing the liquid alcohol with sulphuric acid and applying heat to the mixture , gave the results recorded in the following Table : TABLE X.-Olefiant Gas .

A few remarks on these results may be introduced here .
In the case of carbonic oxide ( Table VI .
) , we see that while a length of 2'8 inches of gas is competent , when acting alone , to intercept 6*8 per cent. of the radiant heat , the cutting off of this length from a tube 49'4 inches long , or , what is the same , the addition of this length to a tube 46'6 inches long , makes no sensible change in its absorption .
The second chamber absorbs as much as both .
The same remark applies to carbonic acid , and it is also true within the limits of error for nitrous oxide and olefiant gas .
Indeed it is only when 8 inches or more of the column have been cut away that the difference begins to make itself felt .
Thus , in carbonic oxide , the absorption of a length of 41-4 being 12-2 , that of a chamber 49'4 , or 8 inches longer , is only 12'9 , making a difference of only 0'7 per cent. , while the same 8 inches acting singly on the gas produces an absorption of 9-6 per cent. So also with regard to carbonic acid ; a tube 41'4 absorbing 12-7 per cent. , a tube 49-4 absorbs only 13'0 per cent.-making a difference of only 0'3 per cent. As regards olefiant gas ( Table IX .
) , while a distance of 8 inches acting singly effects an absorption of 44 per cent. , the addition of 8 inches to a tube already 41'4 inches in length raises the absorption only frQm 65 3 to 67'5 , or 2'2 per cent. The reason is plain .
In a length of 41'4 the rays capable of being absorbed by the gas are so much diminished , so few in fact remain to be attacked , that an additional 8 inches of gas produces a scarcely sensible effect .
Similar considerations explain the fact , that while by augmenting the length of 2r2 209 the first chamber from 2'8 inches to 15'4 inches we increase the absorption of olefiant gas nearly 20 per cent. , the shortening of the second chamber by precisely the same amount effects a diminution of barely 4 per cent. of the absorption .
All these results conspire to prove the heterogeneous character of the radiation from a source heated to about 250 ?
C. The sum of the absorptions placed side by side with the absorption of the sum exhibits the influence of sifting in an instructive manner .

The Tables also show that the ratio of the sum of the absorptions to the absorption of the sum is practically constant for all the gases .
Dividing the first mean by the second in the respective cases , we have the following quotients : Carbonic oxide ... . .
170 Carbonic acid ... . .
172 Nitrous oxide ... . .
161 Olefiant gas ( mean of both ) ... . .
1P68 The sum of the absorptions ought to be a maximum when the two chambers are of equal length .
Supposing them to be unequal , one being in excess of half the length of the tube , let us consider the action of this excess singly .
Placed after the half-length , it receives the rays which have already traversed that half ; placed after the shorter length , it receives the rays which have traversed the shorter length .
In the former case , therefore , the excess will absorb less than in the latter , because the rays in the former case have been more thoroughly sifted before the heat reaches the excess .
From this it is clear that , as regards absorption , more is gained by attaching the excess to the short length of the tube than to the half-length ; in other words , the sum of the absorptions , when the tube is divided into two equal parts , is a maximum .
This reasoning is approximately verified by the experiments .
Supposing , moreover , one of the lengths constantly to diminish , we thus constantly approach the limit when the sum of the absorptions and the absorption of the sum are equal to each other , the former being then a minimum .
The effect of proximity to this limit is exhibited in the first experiment in each of the series ; here the lengths of the compartments are very unequal , and the sum of the absorptions is , in general , a minimum .
After the absorption by the permanent gases had been in this way examined , I passed on to the examination of vapours .
They were all used at a common pressure of 0-5 of an inch of mercury , or about -1th of an atmosphere .
The liquid which yielded the vapour was enclosed in the flasks described in my previous memoirs , and the pure vapour was allowed to enter the respective compartments of the experimental tube without the slightest ebullition .
The following series of Tables contains the results thus obtained .

This resolves itself into the proposition that for equal lengths , within the limits of these experiments , the sifting power of the gas is greater than that of the vapour .
The reason of this is that the vapours are examined in a state of tenuity which is only -6lth of that possessed by the gases .
Thus , no matter how powerful the individual molecules may be , their distance asunder renders a thin layer of them a comparatively open screen . ? ?

The entrance of a gas into an exhausted vessel is accompanied by the generation of heat ; and the gas thus warmed , if a radiator , will emit the heat generated .
Conversely , on exhausting a vessel containing any gas , the gas is chilled , and thus an external body , which prior to the act of exhaustion possessed the same temperature as the gas within the vessel , becomes , on the first stroke of the pump , a warm body with reference to the gas remaining in the vessel ; and if the external body be separated from the cooled gas by a diathermic partition , it will radiate into the gas and become chilled by this radiation .
It was shown in my second memoir* that this mode of warming and of chilling a gas or vapour furnished a practical means of determining , without any source of heat external to the gaseous body itself , both its radiative and absorptive energy .
For the sake of convenience I have called the radiation and absorption of a gas or vapour thus dynamically heated and cooled , dynamic radiation and dynamic absorption .
In illustration of the manner in which dynamic radiation may be applied in researches on radiant heat , I have had made , during the last half-year , a considerable number of experiments , some of which I will here describe .
In the first place , the experimental tube was divided into two compartments , as in the experiments described in the foregoing section .
The source of heat was abolished , and one end of the experimental tube was stopped by a plate of polished metal ; the other end was stopped by a transparent plate of rock-salt , while the space between the ends was divided into two compartments by a second plate of rock-salt .
The thermo-electric pile occupied its usual position at the end of the tube , the compensating cube , however , being abandoned .
For the sake of convenient reference , I will call the compartment of the tube most distant from the pile , the first chamber , and that adjacent to the pile , the second chamber .
An outline sketch of the arrangement is given in fig. 3 .

The experiments were conducted in the following manner:-Both compartments being exhausted and the needle at zero , the gas was allowed to enter the first chamber through a gauge-cock which made its time of entry 40 seconds .
The second chamber was preserved a vacuum ; the gas on entering the first chamber was dynamically heated , and radiated its heat to the pile through the vacuous second chamber ; the needle moved and the limit of its excursion was noted .
The first chamber was then exhausted and carefully cleansed with dry air .
The second chamber was filled with the same gas , not with a view to determine its dynamic radiation , but to examine its effect upon the heat radiated from the first chamber .
The needle being at zero , the gas was again permitted to enter the first chamber exactly as in the first experiment , the only difference between the two experiments being , that in the first the heat passed through a vacuum to the pile , while in the second it had to pass through a column of the same kind of gas as that from which it emanated .
In this way the absorption exerted by any gas upon heat , radiated from the same gas , or from any other gas , may be accurately determined .
Finally , the apparatus being cleansed and the needle at zero , the gas was permitted to enter the second chamber , and its dynamic radiation from this chamber was determined .
The intermediate plate of salt S ' was shifted , as in the former experiments , so as to alter the lengths of the two chambers , but the sum of both lengths remained constant as before .
In the following Tables the three columns bracketed under the head of " Deflection , " contain the arcs through which the needle moved in the three cases mentioned ; lo1 when the radiation from the gas in the first chamber passed through the empty second chamber ; 2 ?
, when the radiation from the first chamber passed through the occupied second chamber ; and 3 ?
, when the radiation proceeded from the second chamber .

68-0 65-0 The gases , it will be observed , exhibit a gradually increasing power of dynamic radiation from carbonic oxide up to olefiant gas .
This is most clearly illustrated by reference to the results obtained in the respective cases with the first length of the second chamber .
They are as follows : Carbonic oxide ... .
280 Carbonic acid ... 33'6 Nitrous oxide ... ... 44.5 Olefiant gas ... ... ... .
68'0 Its proximity to the pile , and the fact of its having to cross but one plate of salt , makes the action of the second chamber much greater than that of the first .
Each of the Tables exhibits the fact that as the length of the chamber increases the dynamic radiation of the gas contained in it increases , and as the length diminishes the radiation diminishes .
We also see how powerfully the gas in the second chamber acts upon the radiation from the first .
With carbonic oxide , the presence of the gas in the second chamber reduces the deflection from 130 ?
7 to 6 ?
03 ; with carbonic acid it is reduced from 16-8 to 6*6 ; with nitrous oxide it is reduced from 19'5 to 6'2 .
Now this residual deflection , 6 ?
'2 , is not entirely due to the transparency of the gas , to heat emitted by the gas .
No matter how well polished the experimental tube may be , there is always a certain radiation from its interior surface when the gas enters it .
With perfectly dry air this radiation amounts to 8 or 9 degrees .
Thus the radiation is composite , in part emanating from the molecules in the first chamber , and in part emanating from the surface of the tube..To these latter , the gas in the second chamber would be much more permeable than to the former ; and to these latter , I believe , the residual deflection of 6 degrees , or thereabouts , is mainly due .
That this number turns up so often , although the radiations from the various gases differ considerably , is in harmony with the supposition just made .
In the case of carbonic oxide , for example , the deflection is reduced from 130 ?
7 to 6 ?
03 , while in the case of nitrous oxide it is reduced from 19 ?
-5 to 6 ?
-2 ; in the case of olefiant gas it is reduced from 590 to 100 ?
4 , while in other experiments ( not here recorded ) the deflection by olefiant gas was reduced from 440 to 6 ? .
As may be expected , this radiation from the interior surface augments with the tarnish of the surface , but the extent to which it may be increased is hardly sufficiently known .
Indeed the gravest errors are possible in experiments of this nature if the influence of the interior be overlooked or misunderstood .
An experiment or two will illustrate this more forcibly than any words of mine .
A brass tube 3 feet long , and very slightly tarnished within , was used for dynamic radiation .
Dry air on entering the tube produced a deflection of 12 degrees .
The tube was then polished within , and the experiment repeated ; the action of dry air was instantly reduced to 7'5 degrees .
The rock-salt plate at the end of the tube was then removed , and a lining of black paper 2 feet long was introduced within it .
The tube was again closed , and the experiment of allowing dry air to enter it repeated .
The deflections observed in three successive experiments were 80 ?
, 81 ?
, 80 ? .
This result might be obtained as long as the lining continued within the tube .
219 , The plate of rock-salt was again removed , and the length of the lining was reduced to a foot ; the dynamic radiation on the entrance of dry air in three successive experiments gave the deflections 76 ? ?
74 , 75 ? .
The plate was again removed and the lining reduced to 3 inches ; the deflections obtained in two successive experiments were 66 ?
, 65 ? .
Finally , the lining was reduced to a ring only 11 inch in width ; the dynamic radiation from this small surface gave in two successive trials the deflections 560 560.5 .
The lining was then entirely removed , and the deflection instantly fell to 7 ?
05 .
A coating of lampblack within the tube produced the same effect as the paper lining ; common writing-paper was almost equally effective ; a coating of varnish also produced large deflections , and the mere oxidation of the interior surface of the tube is also very effective .
In the above experiments the lining was first heated , and it then radiated its heat through a thick plate of rock-salt against the pile .
The effect of the heat was enfeebled by distance , by reflexion from the surfaces of the salt , and by partial absorption .
Still we see that the radiation thus weakened was competent to drive the needle almost through the quadrant of a circle .
If instead of being thus separated from the lining the face of the pile itself had formed part of the interior surface of the tube , receiving there the direct impact of the particles of air , of course the deflections would be far greater than the highest of those above recorded .
Indeed I do not doubt my ability to cause the needle of my galvanometer to whirl , by the dynamic heating of the surface of my pile , through an arc of 1000 degrees .
Assuredly an arrangement subject to disturbances of this character cannot be suitable in experiments in which the greatest delicacy is necessary .
Experiments on dynamic radiation , similar to those executed with gases , were made with vapours .
The tube was divided into two compartments as before .
Both compartments being exhausted , vapour'was permitted to enter the first chamber .
Dry air was afterwards permitted to enter the same chamber ; the air was heated , it warmed the vapour , and the vapour radiated its heat against the pile .
The heat passed in the first experiment through a vacuous second chamber , and in the second experiment through the same chamber when it contained 0'5 of an inch of the same vapour as that from which the rays issued .
A third experiment was made to determine the dynamic radiation from the second chamber .

'5 , the same amount of shortening causes benzol vapour to fall from 34 ?
to 15'1-a much greater diminution .
So also as regards olefiant gas , a shortening of the radiating column from 34 inches to 13-1 inches causes a fall in the deflection only from 68 ?
to 65 ?
; the same diminution produces with sulphuric ether a fall from 68 ?
to 36 ?
'5 ; and with acetic ether from 73 ?
'9 to 41 ? .
In the long column acetic ether vapour beats olefiant gas , but in the short column the gas beats the vapour .
One of the earliest series of experiments of this nature which were executed last autumn , though not free from irregularities , is nevertheless worth recording .
The experiments were made with a brass tube , slightly tarnished within , the tube being 49'4 inches long , and divided into two equal compartments , each 24-7 inches in length , by a partition of rock-salt placed at the centre of the tube .

53-3 30'0 82-1 To ascertain whether the absorption by the vapours bears any significant relation to the absorption by the liquids from which these vapours were derived , the transmission of radiant heat through those liquids was examined .
The open flame of an oil-lamp was used , and the liquids were enclosed in rock-salt cells .
Thus the total radiation from the lamp , with the exception of the minute fraction absorbed by the rock-salt , was brought to bear upon the liquid .
In the following Table the liquids are arranged in the order of their powers of transmission .

33 Alcohol ... ... ... .30 Water saturated with rock-salt ... ... 26 These results are but approximate , but they are not very far from the truth ; and it is impossible to regard them without feeling how purely the act of absorption is a molecular act , and that when a liquid is a powerful absorber the vapour of that liquid is sure also to be a powerful absorber .
To experiment with water , it was necessary to saturate it with the salt of which the cell was formed , but the absorptive energy is due solely to the water .
We might infer from this alone , were no experiments made on the aqueous vapour of the atmosphere , that that vapour must exert a powerful action upon terrestrial radiation .
In fact , in all the statements that I have hitherto made I have underrated its action .
The deportment of the elements sulphur and iodine , dissolved in bisulphide of carbon , is in striking harmony with all that we have hitherto discovered regarding the action of elementary bodies .
The saturation of the bisulphide by sulphur scarcely affects the transmission , while a quantity of iodine sufficient to convert the liquid from one of perfect transparency to one of almost perfect opacity to light , produces a diminution of only two per cent. of the radiation .
This shows that the heat really used in these experiments consists almost wholly of the obscure rays of the lamp .
It is worth remarking that the obscure rays of a luminous source have a much greater power of penetration in the case of the liquids here examined than the rays from an obscure source , however close to incandescence .
The deportment of bromine is also very instructive .
The liquid is very dense , and so opaque as to cut off the luminous rays of the lamps , till it transmits 77 per cent. of the total radiation .
It stands in point of diathermancy above every compound liquid in the list except bisulphide of carbon .
This latter substance is the rocksalt of liquids .
Before a strict comparison can be made between vapours and liquids , they must be examined by heat of the same quality , and I have already made arrangements with which I hope to obtain more complete and accurate results than those above recorded .
