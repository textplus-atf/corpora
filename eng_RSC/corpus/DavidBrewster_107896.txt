On the laws of the polarization of light by refraction .
By DAVID BREWSTER .
LL. D. F.R.S. L. 8 E. Read Feb. 25 , 1830 .
IN the autumn of 1813 I announced to the Royal Society the discovery which I had then made of the polarization of light by refraction* ; and in the November following I communicated an extensive series of experiments which established the general law of the phenomenon .
During the sixteen years which have since elapsed , the subject does not seem to have made any progress .
From experiments indeed stated to have been performed at all angles of incidence with plates of glass , M.ARAGO announced that the quantity of light which the plate polarized by reflexion at any given angle was equal to the quantity polarized by transmission ; but this result , founded upon incorrect observation , led to false views , and thus contributed to stop the progress of this branch of optics .
I had shown in 1813 , from incontrovertible experiments , that the action of each refracting , surface in polarizing light , produced a physical change on the refracted pencil , and brought it into a state approaching more and more to that of complete polarization .
But this result , which will be presently demonstrated , was opposed as hypothetical by Dr. YOUNG and the French philosophers ; and Mr. HERSCHEL has more recently given it as his decision , that of the two contending opinions , that which was first asserted by MALUS , and subsequently maintained by BIOT , ARAGO , and FRESNEL , is the most probable , -namely , that the unpolarized part of the pencil , in place of having suffered any physical change , retains the condition of common light .
I shall now proceed to apply to this subject the same principles which I have already applied to the polarization of light by reflexion , and to establish on the basis of actual experiment the true laws of the phenomena .
The first step in this inquiry is to ascertain the law according to which the polarizing force of the refracting surface changes the position of the planes of polarized light , -a subject which , in as far as I know , has not occupied the attention of any other person .
If we take a plate of glass deviating so slightly from parallelism as to throw off from the principal image the images formed by reflexion from its inner surfaces , we shall be able to see , even at great obliquities , the transmitted light free from all admixture of reflected light .
Let this plate be placed upon a divided circle , so that we can observe through it Fig. .
two luminous discs of polarized light A , B ( Fig. 1 .
) at BO formed by double refraction , and having their planes 6d of polarization inclined + 45 ?
and 45 ?
to the plane of refraction .
At an angle of incidence of 0 ?
, when the light passes perpendicularly , the inclination of ( ... ... ... ... ... .-s the planes of polarization will suffer no change ; but at an incidence of 30 ?
they will be turned round O 40 ' ; so that their inclination to MN or the angle aec will be 45§ 40 ' .
At 45 ?
their inclination 6 " .
will be 46§ 47 ' .
At 60 ?
it will be 50§ 7 ' ; and it will increase gradually to 90 ?
, where it becomes 66§ 19 ' .
507 Hence the maximum change produced by a single plate of glass upon the planes of polarization is ... . .
66§ 19 ' 45 ?
= 21§ 19 ' , an effect exactly equal to\ " what is produced by reflexion at angles of 39 or 70 ? .
N It is remarkable , however , that this change is made in the opposite direction , the planes of polarization now approaching to coincidence in a plane at right angles to that of reflexion .
This difference is exactly what might have been expected from the opposite character of the resulting polarization , the poles of the particles of light which were formerly repelled by the force of reflexion , being now attracted by the refracting force .
In this experiment the action of the two surfaces is developed in succession , so that we cannot deduce from the maximum rotation of 21§ 19 ' , the real 134 action of the first , or of a single surface , which must be obviously more than half of the action of the two surfaces , because the planes of polarization have been widened before they undergo the action of the second surface .
In order to obtain the rotation due to a single surface , I took a prism of glass ABC ( Fig. 2 .
) A Fi .
having such an angle BA C , that a ray RR , X7 iB incident as obliquely as possible , should emerge in a direction Rr perpendicular to the surface AC .
I took care that this prism was well C annealed , and I caused the refraction to be performed as near as possible to the vertex A , where the glass was thinnest and consequently most free from the influence of any polarizing structure .
In this way I obtained the following measures .

16 0I was now desirous of ascertaining the influence of refractive power , although I had already determined in 1813 , that a greater quantity of light was polarized , at the same angle of incidence , by plates of a high than by plates of a 135 low refractive power .
I experienced great difficulty in this part of the inquiry , from the necessity of having plates without any crystalline structure .
I tried gold leaf in a variety of ways ; but I found it almost impossible to obtain correct results , on account of the light which was transmitted unchanged through its pores .
By stretching a film of soapy water across a rectangular frame of copper wire I obtained the following measure .

17 32 From a comparison of these results it is manifest that the rotation increases with the refractive power .
In examining the effects produced at different angles of incidence , it becomes obvious that the rotation varies with the deviation of the refracted ray ; that is , with i i ' the difference of the angles of incidence and refraction .
Hence from a consideration of the circumstances of the phanomena I have been led to express the inclination p of the planes of polarization to the plane of refraction by the formula , Cot p =_ cos ( i i ' ) , the rotation being = 45 ? .
This formula obviously gives a minimum at 0 , and a maximum at 90 ?
; and at intermediate points it represents the experiments so accurately , that when the rhomb of calcareous spar is set to the calculated angle of inclination , the extraordinary image is completely invisible , -a striking test of the correctness of the principle on which it is founded .
The above expression is of course suited only to the case where the inclination x of the planes of polarization ab , cd , ( Fig. 1 , ) is 45 ?
; but when this is not the case , the general expression is Cot =cot x cos ( i -i ) .
When the light passes through a second surface , as in a single plate of glass , the value of x for the second surface is evidently the value of p after the 1st refraction , or in general , calling 0 the inclination after any number n of refractions , and p the inclination after one refraction , Cot 0= ( cot )p When 0 is given by observation we have Cot p= -/ cot 0 .
The general formula for any inclination x and any number n of refractions is Cot = ( cot x cos ( ii ' ) ) , and Cot p= -/ cot x cos ( i -i ' ) .
And when x= 45 and cot x=1 as in common light , Cot 0= ( cos ( i i ' ) ) Cot p=/ cos ( i -i ' ) .
As the term ( cos ( i i ' ) ) can never become equal to 0 , the planes of polarization can never be brought into a state of coincidence in a plane perpendicular to that of reflexion , either at the polarizing angle , or at any other angle .
In order to compare the formula with experiment , I took a plate of well annealed glass , which at all incidences separates the reflected from the transmitted rays , and in which m was nearly 1.510 , and I obtained the following results .

In determining the quantity of polarized light in the refracted pencil , we must follow the method already explained for the reflected ray , mutatis mutandis .
The principal section of the analysing rhomb being now .
supposed to be placed in a plane perpendicular to the plane of reflexion , the quantity of light Q ' polarized in that plane , will be Q= _12 cos 2 , the quantity of transmitted light being unity .

As the planes of polarization of a pencil polarized + 45 ?
and 45 ?
cannot be brought into a state of coincidence by refraction , the quantity of light polarized by refraction can never be mathematically equal to the whole of the transmitted pencil , however numerous be the refractions which it undergoes ; or , what is the same thing , refraction cannot produce rays truly polarized , that is , with their planes of polarization parallel .
The preceding analysis of the changes produced on common light , considered as represented by two oppositely polarized pencils , furnishes us with the same conclusions respecting the partial polarization of light by refraction , which we deduced in a preceding paper respecting the partial polarization of light by 140 reflexion .
Each refracting surface produces a change in the position of the planes of polarization , and consequently a physical change upon the transmitted pencil by which it has approached to the state of complete polarization .
This position I shall illustrate by applying the formula to the experiments which I have published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1814 .
According to the first of these experiments , the light of a wax candle at the distance of ten or twelve feet is wholly polarized by eight plates , or sixteen surfaces of parallel plate glass at an angle of 78§ 52 ' .
Now I have ascertained that a pencil of light of this intensity , will disappear from the extraordinary image , or appear to be completely polarized , provided its planes of polarization do not form an angle of less than 88o ?
with the plane of refraction for a moderate number of plates , or 88- ?
for a considerable number of plates , the difference arising from the great diminution of the light in passing through the substance of the glass .
In the present case the formula gives Cot = ( cos ( ii'))'6 and 0= 88§ 50 ' ; so that the light should appear to be completely polarized , as it was found to be .
At an angle of 61 ?
0 ' the pencil was polarized by 24 plates or 48 surfaces .
Here Cot 8= ( cos ( i i'))48 = 89 36 ' .
At an angle of 43§ 34 ' the light was polarized by 47 plates or 94 surfaces .
Here Cot 0= ( cos ( i i'))94 and 0= 88§ 27 ' .
It is needless to carry this comparison any further ; but it may be interesting to ascertain by the formula the smallest number of refractions which will produce complete polarization .
In this case the angle of incidence must be 90 ? .
Hence p= 56§ 29 ' and ( cos ( i i'))9 gives 88§ 36 ' , and ( cos ( i i))'1 89§ 4 ' ; that is , the polarization will be nearly complete by the most oblique transmission through 42 plates or 9 surfaces , and will be perfectly complete through 5 plates or 10 surfaces .
Having thus obtained formulae for the quantity of light polarized by refraction and reflexion , it becomes a point of great importance to compare the results which they furnish .
Calling R the reflected light , these formule become ( cos ( i + i ) R ( cos ( -il ) Q1R2+ ( COS(z- ) ) But these two quantities are exactly equal , and hence we obtain the important .
general law , that , -At the first surface of all bodies , and at all angles of incidence , the quantity of light polarized by refraction is equal to the quantity polarized by reflection .
I have said ' of all bodies ' , because the law is equally applicable to the surfaces of crystallized and metallic bodies , though the action of their first surface is masked or modified by other causes .
It is obvious from the formula that there must be some angle of incidence where R=1 R , that is , where the reflected is equal to the transmitted light .
When this takes place , we have sin2 p= cos2 ' , that is , The reflected is equal to the transmitted light , when the inclination of the planes of polarization of the reflected pencil to the plane of reflection , is the complement of the inclination of the planes of polarization of the refracted pencil to the same plane ; -or if we refer the inclination of the planes to the two rectangular planes into which the planes of polarization are brought , The reflected will be equal to the transmitted light when the inclination of the planes of polarization of the reflected pencil to the plane of reflection , is equal to the inclination of the plane of polarization of the refracted pencil to a plane perpendicular to the plane of reflection .
In order to show the connection between the phanomena of the reflected and those of the transmitted light , I have given the following Table , which shows the inclination of the planes of polarization of the reflected and the refracted pencil , and the quantities of light reflected , transmitted , and polarized , at all angles of incidence upon glass , m being equal to 1.525 , and the incident light = 1000 .

because the force which polarizes it is there a minimum .
At the maximum polarizing angle , Q is only 79 ?
because the glass is incapable of reflecting more light at that angle , otherwise more would have been polarized .
The value of Q then rises to its maximum at 78§ 7 ' , and descends to its minimum at 90 ?
; but the polarizing force has not increased from 56§ 45 ' to 78§ 7 , as the value of p ' shows .
It is only the quantity of reflected light that has increased , which occasions a greater quantity of light to disappear from the extraordinary image of the analysing rhomb .
The case however is different with the refracted light .
The value of Q ' has one minimum at 0 ?
and another at 90 ?
J while its maximum is at 78 ?
0 7 , 143 while the force has its minimum at 0 ?
and its maximum at 90 ?
, where its effect is a minimum only because there is no light to polarize .
At the incidence of 78§ 7 ' , where the quantities Q , Q ' reach their maxima , the reflected light is exactly one half of the transmitted light ; sin2 o ' cos2 p and tan '= cos p. At 85§ 50 ' 40 " , where the transmitted light is one half of the reflected light , the deviation ( i i ' ) = 450 , and the quantity of polarized light is one third of the transmitted light , one sixth of the reflected light , and one ninth of the incident light .
Sin2 ' : cos2 p= reflected light : transmitted light , and cot p ' = sin ( i i ' ) .
At 450 we have ( i + i ' ) + ( i i ' ) = 900 and o ' = ( i i ' ) , Tan ( i i ) = cos ( i : ' , and tan ( i -)2 = ( sin ( i i ' ) ) At 56§ 45 ' , the polarizing angle , the formula for reflected light becomes R=2 ( sin2 ( ii))2 ; but at this angle we have i ' = 90 i. Hence we obtain the following simple expression in terms of the angle of incidence , for the quantity of light reflected by all bodies at the polarizing angle .
R= ( cos 2)2 .
I have already mentioned the experiment of M. ARAGO with plates of glass , in which he found that " at every possible inclination " the quantity of light polarized by transmission was equal to the quantity polarized by reflexion .
This conclusion he extends to single surfaces ; but it is remarkable that the law is true of single surfaces in which he did not ascertain it to be true , while it is incorrect with regard to plates in which he believes that he has ascertained it to be true .
As the consideration of this point does not strictly belong to t"he present branch of the inquiry , I shall reserve it for a separate communication , " On the action of the second surfaces of transparent plates upon Light .
