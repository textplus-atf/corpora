The chief product obtained by the action of chlorine upon propane consists , as I have already stated in my last communication ?
, of propylene dichloride ; besides this compound , we find in smaller quantities the normal propyl chloride and products richer in chlorine , which boil between * Zeitschrift fur Chemie , N. F. vol. v. p. 55 .

and 200 ?
C. To obtain the latter in larger quantities , I took those portions of the substitution-products which boiled above 80 ?
, and passed chlorine into them for several days , having them exposed to direct sunlight , as in diffused light hardly any action took place .
By this means a liquid was obtained which boiled between 120 ?
and 200 ? .
Subjected to fractional distillation , the greater portion boiled between 150 ?
and 160 ?
, but it was found impossbile to isolate a compound having a constant boilingpoint .
The reaction of this liquid , as well as the boiling-point and the analysis , show that it consists of trichlorhydrine , C3 H3 C13 , mixed with higher chlorinated products .

72-20 per cent. Cl. 73-34 per cent. The reaction most characteristic of trichlorhydrine is that , on heating it with caustic potash , it decomposes into hydrochloric acid and epidichlorhydrine , C3 HI C1 , a liquid which boils at 100 ?
, and which combines directly with bromine , forming the compound C3 I- , C12 Br2 , the boilingpoint of which is 220 ? .
On heating the liquid , boiling between 150 ?
and 160 ?
, with powdered caustic potash , a violent reaction set in , and , besides water , a heavy oil distilled over , which possessed the somewhat garlic-like odour of epidichlorhydrine , and which boiled between 95 ?
and 105 ? .
The higher chlorinated products contained in the original liquid were destroyed by this reaction , carbonaceous matter being left with the potassium chloride in the retort .
To the impure epidichlorydrine thus obtained bromine was added ; this combined with it with a hissing noise and evolution of heat .
On distillation , the greater portion of the compound boiled at 2000-2200 ; the part boiling between 215 ?
and 220 ?
was analyzed .
0'1835 of this compound gave 0'4455 of a mixture of silver chloride and silver bromide .
0'2955 of this mixture left , on heating it in a current of hydrogen , 0-1928 silver .

and 160 ?
contained a large proportion of trichlorhydrine .
It is noteworthy to remark that the substitution-products of the primary propyl chloride are identical with those of the secondary chloride , as , according to Linnemann , on passing chlorine into isopropyl iodide , the products which are formed are ( 1 ) the secondary chloride , ( 2 ) probably propylene dichloride , and ( 3 ) trichlorhydrine .
In my last communication I have already called attention to the different behaviour of ethane and propane under the action of chlorine .
A further instance is the formation of trichlorhydrine , the chemical structure of which is most probably expressed by the formula C 11 Cl-C H Cl -C,2HCl , whilst by substituting 3 atoms of hydrogen by chlorine in ethane , the compound C H3-C3 is formed .
The liquid from which I had separated the trichlorhydrine was again treated with chlorine in the direct sunlight for several days .
On distilling it afterwards , it came over between 200 ?
and 250 ? .
The portion boiling between 200 ?
and 205 ?
solidified in the receiver as a white , crystalline mass .
In order to remove from it an oily liquid which it contained , it was pressed between filter-paper and recrystallized repeatedly from alcohol .

Its smell strongly resembles that of camphor .
Exposed to the air , it " volatilizes pretty quickly ; heated in a test-tube , it fuses , subliming rapidly at the same time .
In a sealed capillary tube it melted at 177 ?
-178 ?
, and solidified again at 176 ?
-175 ? .
The liquid boiling between 2050 and 250 ?
was very little acted upon by chlorine even in the brightest sunshine and presence of iodine ; also treatment with potassium chlorate and filming hydrochloric acid produced little effect , as , after acting upon it for several days , the liquid boiled again between 220 ?
and 250 ? .
The portion boiling between 243 ?
and 250 ?
was analyzed:0-1926 gave 016580 silver chloride and 0'0034 silver .

85'04 per cent. This compound is therefore hexachlorpropane , C3 H1 C16 , a colourless , heavy liquid , which smells somewhat like camphor , and boils without ' decomposition at about 2500 .
From these experiments it would appear that in propane we cannot replace by direct substitution more than six atoms of hydrogen by chlorine .
This observation gains in interest by the fact that in sextane ( hexylhydride ) C6 H1 , , from petroleum also not more than six atoms of hydrogen * Annal .

831 Pelouze and Cahours* state that the last substitution-product of this hydrocarbon is the compound C6 H8 C1 .
I repeated this experiment , and passed chlorine into pure sextane , first in the diffused and afterwards in the direct sunlight , as long as any action could be observed .
Thus I obtained a heavy colourless liquid , which did not distil without decomposition , the analysis of which showed that it had the above composition .
0*1612 gave 0'4654 silver chloride and 0'0076 silver .
