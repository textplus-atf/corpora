Diphenylamine .
" By A. W. , HOFMANN , LL. D. , F.R.S. , Received June 16 , 1864 .
In the course of last year* I published an account of some experiments upon the composition of the blue colouring-matter discovered by MM .
Girard and De Laire when studying the action of aniline upon rosaniline .
These experiments had established a simple relation between aniline-red and aniline-blue , the latter exhibiting the composition of triphenylated.s .
rosaniline , 201 2N , ll0O3CKi65N=3ll , N+C2 I , ),3 ( 6WN HO0 20 1If39 32 CG It ; 3+ 20 ( er t1 3 ' 2 The composition of aniline-blue has since been also investigated by M. Schifft , who , in a paper published shortly after my first communication upon this subject , attributes to this compoulnd a formula differing from the expression at which I had arrived .
According to M. Schiff , aniline-blue is not a triamine , as I had found , but a tetramine , which may be looked upon as a combination of rosaniline with triphenylamine , C38 -I-34 N4 , H20= C20 I 19 N3 , H20 + ( C1 HA)3 N. This formula is less simple than the one I had given ; it attributes to aniline-blue a constitution not supported by analogy , and involves the necessity of assuming , for the formationi of this substance , a reaction which ceases to be a simple process of substitutioni .
M. Schiff 's formula is giveii as the result of an unfinislhed inquiry , and the author himself appears to have but limited confidence in its correctness .
Nevertheless , the publication of his Note imposed upon me the duty of confirming by new experiments the result of my former researches upon this subject .
The material used in these new experimenits was likewise furnished to me by Mr. Nicholson ; it had been taken from the product of any operation perfectly different from the one which had supplied the first specimen .
In the following synopsis the experimental numbers of the former analyses are marked ( a ) , in contradistinction to those ( b ) recently performed .

The resumption of this inquiry has led-me to some observations which afford an additional-support of the compositionl of aniline-blue .
Rosaniline , when submitted to dry distillation , undergoes an irregular decomposition .
Ammonia is evolved , a large amount of liquid bases ( from 40 to 50 per cent. ) passes over , and a porous mass of charcoal remnains in the retort .
The principal constituent of the liquid product is aniline .
Ethyl-rosaniline , the commercial aniline-violet , already manufactured on a large scale by Messrs. Simpsonl , Maule , and Nicholsoni , when distilled , exhibits similar phenomena .
There is nio difficulty in separating from the liquid product an appreciable amount of ethylaniline , the presence of which has been established by the examination of the platinum-salt .
The relation existing between aniline-violet , obtained by the action of iodide of ethyl , and anilinle-red , cainnot possibly be doubtfuil .
Now , since analysis points out similar relations between aniline-blue and aniline-red , it became perfectly legitimate to anticipate , amoing the products of distillation of aniline-blue , i.e. of phenylated rosaniline , the presence of phenylated aniline , or diphenylainine , a substance which chemists had often , but vainly , endeavoured to prepare .
Experiment has verified this anticipation .
Some weeks ago my frlend , M. Charles Girard , Director of the Works of the Fuchsine Company at Lyons , had the kindness to transmit to me for examination some basic oils of high boiling-point which he had obtained by the destructive distillation of a considerable quantity of aniline-blue .
The product of distillation which he forwarded to me was brown and viscid .
When rectified , it furnished a slightly coloured liquid ; at 300 ?
the thermometer indicated the distillation of a definite compound .
The distillate which had passed between 2800 and 300 ?
solidified on addition of hydrochloric acid , a chloride difficultlv soluble ( nor especially in concentrated hydrochloric acid ) being formed .
By washing with alcohol , and ultimately by crystallization from this liquiid , the chloride was obtained in a state of purity .
When treated with ammonia , it furnished colourless oily drops , which , after a few moments , solidified to a white crystalline mass .
The crystals thus obtained possess a peculiar flower-like odour ; their taste is aromatic , and afterwards burning .
At 45 ?
they fuse to a yellowish oil , distilling constantly , and without alteration , at 312 ?
( corr .
) .
They are almost iinsoluble in water , easily soluble in alcohol and ether .
Neither in aqueous nor in alcoholic solution has the substance any alkaline reaction .
When brought into contact with concentrated acids , the crystals are converted into the corresponding salts , which .
are remarkable for their instability .
On the addition of water , the base separates in oily drops , rapidly solidifying to -crystals .
The chloride , when washed with water , loses every trace of hydrochloric acid .
The analysis of the base has led to the formula C12 Hl N. The composition of the chloride , which crystallizes from alcohol in concentrically grouped needles , assuming a bluish tint by contact with the air , is C12 H1 N , IIC .
I do not believe that I am deceived in considering this compound as diphenylamine , C60 5 C12 T11 N= C6 115 N.:HC It deserves , however , to be stated that the strict experimental demonstration of this mode of viewing the compound is still wanting , the ethylation of the substance presenting difficulties that I have not yet been able to overcome .
I regret this gap , since the experience acquired in the study of xenylamine , isomeric with diphenylamnine , 12~~C1 19 II } -C H5 c12 HllNl}N=C 6H5}N~ I-I H and which for several weeks I regarded as the secondary phenyl-base , points out the necessity of consistently carrying out the process of ethylation in the examination of bases of this kind .
Diphenylamine exhibits a peculiar reaction , which , while it appears to reveal its relation to the colour-generating aniline , enables us to recognize the presence of the new base .
In contact with concentrated nitric acid , -diphenylamine , as well as its salts , assumes at once a magnificent blue coloration .
The reaction succeeds best by pouring concentrated hydro .
chloric acid upon a crystal of the base , and then adding the nitric acid drop by drop .
Immediately the whole liquid becomes intensely indigo-blue .
Minute quantities of diphenylamine may in this manner be readily traced .
I have thus been enabled to ascertain the presence of this body , or , at all events , of a substance exhibiting this particular reaction , in the products of .
distillation of rosaniline , leucaniline , and even of melaniline .
The last experiment deserves particularly to be noticed , since it affords the general method for the production of the secondary aromatic monamines , which was hitherto wanting .
The substance possessing the blue colour is formed also by the action of other oxidizing agents .
On adding chloride of platinum to a solution of the chloride , the liquid at once assumes a deep-blue colour .
Only , from very concelntrated solutions , a platinum-salt is deposited exhibiting an undesirably blue tinit .
WVhen a mixture of diphenylamine and toluidine is submitted to one of the processes ( treatment with chloride of mercury or arsenic acid ) which , if phenylamine and toluidine had been employed , would have furnished rosaniline , a mass is formed which dissolves in alcohol with a magnificent blue coloration , and possesses the characters of a true colouring-matter .
An alcoholic solution of diphenylamine furnishes , on addition of bromine , a yellow crystalline precipitate , difficultly soluble in cold alcohol , but crystallizing from boiling alcohol in beautiful needles of a satiny lustre .
According to analysis , they contain C12 117 Br4 N , a formula which renders the grouping C6 H3 Br2 H probable .
A mixture of diphenylamine and chloride of benzoyl , when heated , fiurnisbes a thicl oil , which solidifies on cooling .
Washed with water and alkali , and recrystallized from boiling alcohol , in which it dissolves with difficulty , the niew compound is obtained in beautifiul white needles .
Analysis has confirmed the theoretical anticipation , C19D HIla NO=_ C6 Ela N. C76 115 This substance has become the starting-point of some experiments which I shall here briefly mention , but to which I intend to return hereafter .
On addition of ordinary concentrated nitric acid , the benzoyl-compound liquefies and dissolves .
From this solution , water precipitates a light yellow crystalline compound , C6 Ha51 019 1N -CR4 ( NO2 ) N , which dissolves in alcoholic soda with a scarlet colour , splitting on ebullition ' into beuizoic acid and reddish-yellow needles of nitro-diphenylamine , C 6H 1 C12 H1o N202=C6 1Ho ( 4NO2)i N. If , instead of ordinary nitric acid , a large excess of the strongest fuimning nitric acid be employed , the solution deposits , on addition of water , a crvstalline compound of a somewhat deeper yellow colour , containing probably 06 114 ( NO2 ) } 05 , 11 13 N3 05 = C6 14 ( NO , )N .
This substance dissolves in alcoholic soda with a most magnificent crimson colour .
Addition of water to the boiling liquid furnishes a yellow crystalline deposit , benzoate ( ?
) of sodium remnaining in solution .
The yellow powder is dinitro^diphenylamine .
From boiling alcohol , it crystallizes in reddish needles , exhibiting a bluish metallic lustre .
The analysis of the compound has led to the formula 06 H4 ( NO2 ) 12 E9 N304= 06 H4 ( NO2 ) N. The chemical history of these compounds will be the subject of a special communication .
