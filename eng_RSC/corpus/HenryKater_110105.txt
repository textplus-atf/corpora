] The author , after stating that the weights and measures of the United Kingdom are founded on a standard whose length is determined by its proportion to that of a pendulum vibrating mean time in London , which has been ascertained by him to be 39-13929 inches of Sir George Shuckburgh 's scale , considers it necessary , on account of the importance of the result , to consider what degree of confidence it is entitled to .
For this purpose it is necessary to compare this final result with those obtained in other experiments and by different methods .
Now it appears that previous to the experiments detailed in the author 's paper on the subject in the Philosophical Transactions for 1818 , on which this result rests , another series is there mentioned , made with the same instruments , but under circumstances which occasioned their rejection , and which , owing to some repairs in the instruments between the two series , which occasioned a material alteration in the distance between the knife edges , have all the weight of experiments made with a different pendulum ; the result of these rejected experiments , however , differed only two ten-thousandths of an inch from that ultimately adopted .
The author next compares the length of the seconds pendulum at Unst and at Leith Fort , as ascertained by him by an invariable pendulum , whose vibrations had previously been determined in London , and whose length was thus known in terms of the London Seconds Pendulum , and as ascertained by M. Biot at the same stations , by means of a variety of pendulums , and by a totally different method of observation , -that of Borda .
The results of this comparison are a difference between the determinations of M. Biot and the author , of 0*00029 inch in excess at the former station , and 0*00015 in defect at the latter .
From this near agreement of all the results , he considers that the length of the seconds pendulum in London , may be regarded as certainly known to within one ten-thousandth of an inch ; while from the near agreement of the results of the French and English experiments on the length of the pendulum , he concludes that the length of the metre in parts of Sir George Shuckburgh 's scale , may also be regarded as known within one ten-thousandth of an inch .
From an account recently published by Captain Sabine of his valuable experiments for the determination of the variations in length of the seconds pendulum , he observes , doubts may be inferred of the accuracy of the method employed by him for the observations for determining the length of the seconds pendulum in London , as well as in those which have been made with the invariable pendulum .
It is asserted there , that taking a mean between the disappearances and re-appearances of the disc , is a more correct method of observation than than pursued by Captain Kater , and that the intervals between the coincidences obtained , by observing the disappearances only of the disc , would be productive of error .
In answer to this objection the author remarks , 1st , That with respect to the convertible pendulum , or that used for determining the absolute length of the seconds pendulum , the disc was made to subtend precisely the same angle as the tail-piece of the pendulum , so that at the moment of disappearance its centre necessarily coincided precisely with the middle of the tail-piece , and the difference between the moments of disappearance and re-appearance is rigorously nothing , an adjustment indispensable in his method of observing , when the o)bject is to determine the true number of vibrations in 24 hours .
2ndly .
With the invariable pendulum , the disc subtended a somewhat less angle than the tail-piece , so that the inferred number of vibrations in 24 hours was diminished about.-yths of a second .
But experiments with the invariable pendulum being intended to be in the strictest sense of the word comparative , this constant difference will no way affect the ultimate result .
But as the most direct way to remove any doubts which may be entertained on the subject , the author has computed from the whole of Captain Sabine 's observations , the successive differences in the vibrations at the various stations visited by him , by the two methods , viz. that of employing the disappearances and re-appearances , and the disappearances alone .
The results only in one instance differ so much as a tenth part of a vibration .
They are indifferently in excess and defect , and the mean of their discrepancies is exactly nothing .
From this he concludes , that if the observations be made as nearly as possible under similar circumstances , the method of observing by disappearances alone is productive of no perceptible error in practice , in experiments with the invariable pendulum , while in those with the convertible pendulum the equal apparent size of the disc and tail-piece precludes the possibility of any , either in practice or theory , from this cause .
The standard of Sir George Shuckburgh having been found identical with that of Bird , in the custody of the clerk of the House of Commons , adopted as the imperial standard unit of extension , the length of the pendulum already determined is fixed with the same degree of precision in parts of the Imperial standard yard .
A repetitionof Sir George Shuckburgh 's experiments on the weight of given volumes of distilled water , and a re-measurement of the cube , sphere , and cylinder used by him , were found to give no material variation from his results ; and these being stated in terms of the mean of several standard weights kept at the House of Commons , the troy pound nearest the mean has been adopted and declared by the legislature to be the original unit of weight under the denomination of the Imperial standard troy pound .
The relation between this pound and the cubic inch of distilled water at 62 ?
Fahrenheit , barometer 30 inches , has been ascertained by the Commissioners of Weights and Measures , who find that the latter contains 252,458 grains , each grain being the 5760 part of the standard troy pound .
The avoirdupois pound is fixed for assigning its proportion to the standard troy pound , so as to contain exactly 7000 such grains .
The Imperial standard gallon is defined by stating its contents under the same circumstances of temperature and pressure at 10 pounds avoirdupois ; and the bushel , by its containing 80 such pounds .
The author having , in compliancewith a request of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty 's Treasury , undertaken to superintend the construction of , and to adjust the principal standards to be deposited at the Exchequer , Guildhall , Dublin , and Edinburgh , Mr. Dollond was directed to prepare those of linear measure , and Mr. Bate those of weight and measure , the proper quality of metal for the latter purpose being determined by experiments instituted for the purpose .
The experiments for adjusting them are then given in full detail .
The troy pounds were first adjusted , and the exactness with which this operation has been performed may be appreciated from this , -that the final errors of none of them exceed 2--oths of a grain .
When brought so near , it was of course not thought necessary to attempt further correction .
The avoirdupois pounds and the weights of the gallon of water were then derived from the troy pounds , and finally adjusted like them by enclosing within the weight , in hollows left for the purpose , wires equal to the errors ascertained to exist in them ; the weights of these wires in each case is stated ; so that should they by any accident be taken out and lost , they may be restored .
He next describes the method used in adjusting the gallon itself , the method of filling it exactly and of weighing it when filled , together with the corrections depending on the circumstances of temperature and pressure under which the experiments were made .
As a final result , it appears that one only of the gallons was ultimately found in error to a greater extent than 1-rths of a grain , the others having their errors less than a fourth of that quantity .
The quarts and pints being next disposed of , the author describes the balance contrived by him for weighing the bushels , which proved so delicate as to turn with a single grain when loaded with 250 pounds in each scale .
The resulting bushels when finally adjusted , were found to have all their apparent errors less than 6*56 grains of water , while the corrections for temperature and pressure only amounted in some cases to no less than 138 grains ; but this depending on the figure of the glass used to cover them , it is not to be understood that the contents of the vessels have actually been ascertained to this degree of precision .
The adjustment of the standard yards is next described ; and the author concludes his paper by a summary of the results arrived at in the present inquiry respecting British weights and measures .
The length , he remarks , of the pendulum vibrating seconds in London has been found in parts of the Imperial standard yard ; so that the value of the yard may au any time be known , having been referred to a natural standard presumed unalterable .
The length of the French metre , a standard expressing a certain portion of the terrestrial meridian , has also been given in parts of the English scale .
The weight of a cubic inch of distilled water has been determined in parts of the Imperial troy pound , and thus the pound if lost may at any future time be recovered .
The avoirdupois pound is now for the first time defined , and the measures of capacity are made to depend on the weight of water they contain ; the Imperial gallon containing ten pounds avoirdupois of water , having been declared to be the unit or only standard measure of capacity , from which all others are to be derived .
This , it is presumed , will tend powerfully to produce uniformity throughout the United Kingdom , by putting it in the power of every individual possessed of standard weights to verify his measures of capacity with the utmost facility .
