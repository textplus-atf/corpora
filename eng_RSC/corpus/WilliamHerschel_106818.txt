Observations on the Planet Veguse By William Herschel , LL. nF R. So Read June 13 , z79rg .
1 HE planet Venus is an object that has long erlgageEl my particular attention .
A series of observatioxls upon it , which I began in April , o777 , has been continued dowrl to thenpresent time .
My first view , when I engaged in the pursuit , was to ascertain thd diurnal rotation of this planetf which , from tht contradictory accounts of CASSINI and BIANCHINI , the former of which states it at hours , while the latter makes it 24 days , appeared to me to remain unknown , as to its real duration : for the observations of these gentlemen , how widely different soever with regard to time , can leave no doubt but that this planet actually has a motion on its axis .
The next objectwas the atmosphere of Venus ; of the existence of which also , after a few months observationsS I could not entertain the least doubt .
The investigation of the real diametew^ was the third object I had in view .
To which may be added , in the last placeS an atterltion to the construction of the planet with regard to permanent appearances S -such as might be occasioned by , or ascribed to seaS continents , or mountains The result of my v:bservations would have been communicated long agon if I had not still flattered myself with the hopes ofsome better success , concerning the diurnal motion of Venus ; which5 ; on accotlnt of the density of the yatmosphere of this plallet , has still eluded my constallt attention , as far as concerns its period and direction Everl at this present time , I should hesitate to give the following extract om my journalsS if it did not seem incumbent upon me 2to examine by what accident I carne to overlook mountains in this planet which are said to be ; ; f sgcb enormous heightn as to exceedfour &gt; fire , and even six times the perpendiGular elevatiox of Omboraco , the hlghest of our mountains 'JX Tlle same paperwllich contains the lines I have quoted gives us likewise many extraordinary relations equally wonderful ; such as hints of the various and singular properties of the atmosphere of Saturn.t A ragged margin in Venus , resembling the uneven border of the moon , as it appears to a power magnifying from 1 to 4.t One cusp of Venus appear ing pointed , and the other blunt , owing to the shadow of some mountain.\#167 ; Flat spherical forms conspicuous on Saturn.ll All which being th:ngs-of which I have never -taken any notice , it will not be amiss to show , by what follows , that neither want of attention : , nor a deficiencyof instruments , could occasion my not perceivingtbese mountains Qf more than 2,3 miles in height ; $4* this jaggerl border of Ven2gs ; and tbeseflat sphericalforms on Saturn .
Indeed with regard to Saturn , I cannot hesitate a single molnent to say , thatj had any such thingsas flat spherical forms existed , they could not possibly have escaped my notice , in the numberless observations with 7 &gt; lo , 2Q , and 4ofeet reflectors , which I have so ofterl directed to that planet .
Hosvever , if the gentleman who has seen the mountains in. .
Venus , has made observations on flat spherical forms on Saturn , it is to be regretted that he has IlOt attended to the revolution of this plarlet ola its axis , which could not remain an hour unkllown to him when he saw these forms .
Last night , for lnstance , I saw two small dark spots on JupiterX I shall llOt call them flat spherical forms , because their flatrless , as well as their sphericity , must be hypothetical ; moreover , these two terms seem to me to contradict each other .
These were evidently removed , in less than an hour , in such a manrler as to point out , very nearly , the direction and quantity of the rotation of this planet .
Before I remark on the rest of the extraordinary relations above-mentioned , I will give a short extract of my observations on Venusn with\ such deductions as it seems to me that we are authorised to make from them .

For the spots assumed often the appearances of optical deceptions , such as might arise from prismatic aSections ; and I was always very unAwilling to lay any stress upon the motion of spots , that -either were extreznely faint and changeable , or whose situa tion could not be precisely ascertained .
However ?
that Ve1RUS has a motion on an axis cannot be doubted from these observations ; and that she has an atmoS.phere is as evident , from the changes I took notice of , which surely cannot be upon the solid bodySof the plarzet .

I whave often taken notice , and again this everui.ng , that the illutninated part of Venus is more than a semi-circle .
Whether the excess of the sun 's diameter alone will account for this , or how far we are to take the twilight of the atmosphere of Venus into considerationS I have hitherto deferred investi gating , as my diskmicrometer wants a moveable paralleln in order to be adjustableS by observationS to the quantity of the horns which is enlightened beyond an hemisphere .

No spot or unevenness in the light of Venus upon either cusp , or in any other part , that could in the least make me suspect a mountain .
I measured the diameter of Venus , and projection of the cusps beyond an hemisphere , by my disk-micrometer .
This was not done by an illutnination as described in the apparatus , ( Phil. Trans. Vol. IJXXIII .
p. 4 .
) when I used it for a nocturnal planet S for , day-light being sufficiently strong there was no occasion to light the lamps .
On the tneasuring disk were drawn colicentric circles , and also a diameter , have ing several lines parallel to it in one of the semicircles .
If there had been timeg I should have prepared a straight edge9 b e , moveable parallel to the diameter a d. See l ab .

A few very eviEdent results may be drawn from the foregong observatlons .
With regaid to the rotation of Venus on an axis , it appears that we may be assured of this planetJs having a diurnal motion , and though the real time of it is still subject to considerable doubts , it can hardly be so slow as 24 days .
Its direction or rather the position of the axis of ATenus , is involved in still greater uncertainty .
The atmosphere of V enlls is prol)ably very considerableS which appears not only from the changes that have been observed in the faint spots on its surfice , but may also be inferred from the illumiination of the cusps , when this planet is near its inferior conjun\#163 ; tion ; where the enliglltened ends of the laorns reach far beyond a semicXl^cle .
I must here take noticeX that the allthor we have before quoted on this subject has the merit of being the first who has pointed out this inferencef I)ut he has overlooked the penulubra arising from the diameter of the sun ; * which has certainly a considerable sllare in X Es luentions it upon another occasion , and says in a note , p. 3X 3 , that { tJuis whole peHumbra , which , according to the greatest vpparent diameter of Fenus , extends from 59 to 60'8 , ( xEor wht reason hU fxes upon these quantities does not appear ) ( ' measZIres , ix the direction peapendicular to the line of the cusps , only o",36 .
" But if , according to him , the apparent diameter of the sun be 44 ' , ( which is less than it ought to be ) the penumbra must certainly exterld likewise upon the surEace of Venus the effect of the extended illumination , and in his angle of w^5 19t will amount to more than two-degrees and a third .
His measures are also defecti-ve , as probably the mirror of his t-feet reflector mThich was a very excellent oneS was by that time considerably tarnished and had lost much of the light necessary to show the extent of the cusps in their full bril lian .
I do not give the calculations I have made of the sextelzt of the twiligh-t of Venus , because my measures were not so satisfactory to myself as I wish then tv be S nor so near the conJllnction as we may hereafter olitain them ; neither were they sufficiently repeatSed .
My computations , however , when compared to those given in the paper on the atmosphere of Venus , show sufficiently that it is of much greater extent , or refractive power , than has bem computed in that paper .
Thosecalculations indeed are so full of inaccuracies , that i-t would be necessary to go over them again , in order to compare them strictly with my own , for which at pres-ent there is .
1^ no lelsureO I ought also to take notce here , that the same author , lt seem$ , has taken measures of the horns of Venus by an in strument , which , in his publications , he calls a projection table , and d@scribes as his own $ - ) of which , however those who cle not kllow its construction may have a very perfect idea , when they read the descriptions of my lampg disk , ancI periphery olrer 44+ of a great cire &gt; ; and , in the situxtion which he mentions , that is , 13erpend ; cular to the line of the cusps at the time of the greatest elongation } and when the appawnt diameter of Venus +-s 60d , ( as he makes it ) it must measure o"X38+ .

of 2 micronraetersn joined to what I have mentioned aboure , of using the disk-microlneter without lamps when daylight is sufficieqntly strong S or even with an illumillation in front ?
where the object is bright enough to allow of it , such as the naoonS &amp;c. I reXxexnber drawing the picture of a cottage by it , in the year 17763 which was at three or four miles distance ; and gOing aftervards to compare the parts of it with the building , found t3n1elrz very justly delineated .
I have also many times had the honour of showing my friends the accuracy of the method of applying one eye to .
, the telescope , and the other to the projected picture of the obJect in view S by desiring them to make two points , with a pin , upon a card fixed up at a convenient place , where it might be viewed in Iny telescope S and this being done , I took the distance of these points from the picture I saw projected in a pair of proportional coznpasses , one side of which was to the other as the distance of the object , divided by the distance of the image9 to the magnifying power of the te1e8GOPe ; and giving the conapasses to my friends , they generally found that the proportional ends of them exactly fitted 4tt}t points they had made on the card .
All which experiments are only so alany different ways of using the lamp-micro.7neter.f@S to the mountains in Venlls , I may rrenture to say that so eyen vIhich is not considerably better than mineS or assisted by rntlch better instrulnents , will ever get a sight of them9 though9 from the analogy that obtains between the onSy two planetary giobes we can comparea ( the moon and the earth ) therez is little doubt but that this planet also has inequalities orl its surEace , which may be , for what we can say to the contrary3 very considerable .
The real diameter of Verlus , I should think , may be inferred with great confide}nce , from the tneasures I took with the go-feet reflector ) in the morning of the 24th of Novembera o791 ; which , when reduced to the mean distance of the earth , give 18 " , y9 for the apparent diameter of ths pbSzet .
lthis result ls rather relnarkable , as it seems to prove that Verlus is a little larger than the earth , instead of being a little less , as has been supposed yetg upon the nicest scrutinyn I cannot findl fault with the measures The planet was put between the two wires of the micrometer , which wrere outward tangents ; and they were , after each measure , shut , so as to meet with the same edge , and in the same place where the planet was measured .
In this situation the proper deduction , for laot being central measures , was pointed out by the index plate .
The transits of the 2Sth were corrected for a small concavity of the wires , which being pretty thick and stubborll9 were not strained sllfficiently to luake them quite straight , the amount of which was also ascertained by atl examination of the division where the wires closed at the ends , antl wlaere they closed in the centre .
The zero was , with equal precaution , referred to a point at all equal distance from t]e contact of the xwires on each side ; for they are at liberty to pass over each otherX ^rithout occasioning any derangement .
the s/ Jake , or play , of the screw is less than g\#176 ; tenths of a division .
The two planets , however , are so nearly of an equal size9 that it would be necessary to repeat otlr meastlres of the diameter of Venusn in the most favourable circtltnstances , and with micrometers adjusted:to the utmost degree of precisior in orcier to decide with perfPect confidence that she is , , as ap pears most--likely larger than the earth .
The remarkable pliaenomenon of the bright smargin of Venus , I find , has not been noticed lay the authorXwe have referred to : on the contraryn it is said , Xpage 3to , ; ; tbas lRi &gt; 3rDt appears strongest aX the outwxd limb vXb c , f om when ?

' But the [ urninous border as I have described itn in the observations of the gth -16t.11 , ec.ths and 22d of Apriln does notlin the least agree with the ( X-love:representation .
