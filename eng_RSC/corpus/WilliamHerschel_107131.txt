Catalogue of Soo new Nebul/ , nebulous Stars , planetary Nebulx , and Clusters of Stars ; with Remarks on the Construction of the Heavens .
By William Herschel , LL. D. F.R. S Read July i , 1802 .
SINCE the publication of my former two catalogues of nebulae , I have , in the continuation of my telescopic sweeps , met with a number of objects that will enrich our natural history , as it may be called , of the heavens .
A catalogue of them will be found at the end of this paper , containing 500 new nebulae , nebulous stars , planetary nebulae , and clusters of stars .
These objects have been arranged in eight classes , in conformity with the former catalogues , of which the present one is therefore a regular continuation .
This renders it unnecessary to give any further explanation , either of the contents of its columns , or the abbreviations which have been used in the description of the objects .
It has hitherto been the chief employment of the physical astronomer , to search for new celestial objects , whatsoever might be their nature or condition ; but our stock of materials is now so increased , that we should begin to arrange them more scientifically .
The classification adopted in my catalogues , is little more than an arrangement of the objects for the convenience of the observer , and may be compared to the disposition of the books in a library , where the different sizes of the volumes is often more considered than their contents .
But here , in dividing the different parts of which the sidereal heavens are composed into proper classes , I shall have to examine the nature of the various celestial objects that have been hitherto discovered , in order to arrange them in a manner most conformable to their construction .
This will bring on some extensive considerations , which would be too long for the compass of a single paper ; I shall therefore now only give an enumeration of the species that offer themselves already to our view , and leave a particular examination of the separate divisions , for some early future occasions .
In proceeding from the most simple to the more complex arrangements , several methods , taken from the known laws of gravitation , will be suggested , by which the various systems under consideration may be maintained ; but here also we shall confine ourselves to a general review of the subject , as observation must furnish us first with the necessary data , to establish the application of any one of these methods on a proper foundation .
ENUMERATION OF THE PARTS THAT ENTER INTO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE HEAVENS , I. Of insulated Stars .
In beginning our proposed enumeration , it might be expected that the solar system would stand foremost in the list ; whereas , by treating of insulated stars , we seem , as it were , to overlook one of the great component parts of the universe .
It will , however , soon appear that this very system , magnificent as it is , can only rank as a single individual belonging to the species which we are going to consider .
478 By calling-a star insulated , I do not mean to denote its being totally unconnected with all other stars or systems ; for no one , by the laws of gravitation , can be entirely free from the influence of other celestial bodies .
But , when stars are situated at such immense distances from each other as our sun , Arcturus , Capella , Lyra , Sirius , Canobus , Markab , Bellatrix , Menkar , Shedir , Algorah , Propus , and numberless others probably are , we may then look upon them as sufficiently out of the reach of mutual attractions , to deserve the name of insulated stars .
In order not to take this assertion for granted , without some examination , let us admit , as is highly probable , that the whole orbit of the earth 's annual motion does not subtend more than an angle of one second of a degree , when seen from Sirius .
In consequence of this , it appears by computation , that our sun and Sirius , if we suppose their masses to be equal , would not fall together in less than 3 millions of years , even though they were not impeded by many contrary attractions of other neighbouring insulated stars ; and that , consequently , with the assistance of the opposite energies exerted by such surrounding stars , these two bodies may remain for millions of ages , in a state almost equal to undisturbed rest .
A star thus situated may certainly deserve to be called insulated , since it does not immediately enter into connection with any neighbouring star ; and it is therefore highly probable , that our sun is one of a great number that are in similar circumstances .
To this may be added , that the stars we consider as insulated are also surrounded -by a magnificent collection of innumerable stars , called the milky-way , which must occasion a very powerful balance of opposite attractions , to hold the intermediate stars in a state of rest .
For , though our sun , and all the stars we see , may sQ2 479 truly be said to be in the plane of the milky-way , yet I am now convinced , by a long inspection and continued examination of it , that the milky-way itself consists of stars very differently scattered from those which are immediately about us .
But of this , more will be said on another occasion .
From the detached situation of insulated stars , it appears that they are capable of being the centres of extensive planetary systems .
Of this we have a convincing proof in our sun , which , according to our classification , is one of these stars .
Now , as we enjoy the advantage of being able to view the solar system in all its parts , by means of our telescopes , and are therefore sufficiently acquainted with it , there will be no occasion to enter into a detail of its construction .
The question will now arise , whether every insulated star be a sun like ours , attended with planets , satellites , and numerous comets ?
And here , as nothing appears against the supposition , we may from analogy admit the probability of it .
But , were we to extend this argument to other sidereal constructions , or , still farther , to every star of the heavens , as has been done frequently , I should not only hesitate , but even think that , from what will be said of stars which enter into complicated sidereal systems , the contrary is far more likely to be the case ; and that , probably , we can only look for solar systems among insulated stars .
II .
Of Binary sidereal Systems , or double Stars .
The next part in the construction of the heavens , that offers itself to our consideration , is the union of two stars , that are formed together into one system , by the laws of attraction .
If a certain star should be situated at any , perhaps immense , 480 distance behind another , and but very little deviating from the line in which we see the first , we should then have the appearance of a double star .
But these stars , being totally unconnected , would not form a binary system .
If , on the contrary , two stars should really be situated very near each other , and at the same time so far insulated as not to be materially affected by the attractions of neighbouring stars , they will then compose a separate system , and remain united by the bond of their own mutual gravitation towards each other .
This should be called a real double star ; and any two stars that are thus mutually connected , form the binary sidereal system which we are now to consider .
It is easy to prove , from the doctrine of gravitation , that two stars may be so connected together as to perform circles , or similar ellipses , round their common centre of gravity .
In this case , they will always move in directions opposite and parallel to each other ; and their system , if not destroyed by some foreign cause , will remain permanent .
Figure 1 ( Plate XVI .
) represents two equal stars a and b , moving in one common circular orbit round the centre o , but in the opposite directions of at and bt .
In Fig. 2 we have a similar connection of the two stars a b ; but , as they are of different magnitudes , or contain unequal quantities of matter , they will move in circular orbits of different dimensions round their common centre of gravity o. Fig. 3 represents equal , and Fig. 4 , unequal stars , moving in similar elliptical orbits round a common centre ; and , in all these cases , the directions of the tangents t t , in the places a b , where the stars are , will be opposite and parallel , as will be more fully explained hereafter .
These four orbits , simple as they are , open an extensive field for reflection , and , I may add , for calculation .
They show , even before we come to more complicated combinations , where the same will be confirmed , that there is an essential difference between the construction of solar and sidereal systems .
In each solar system , we have a very ponderous attractive centre , by which all the planets , satellites , and comets are governed , and kept in their orbits .
Sidereal systems take a greater scope : the stars of which they are composed move round an empty centre , to which they are nevertheless as firmly bound as the planets to their massy one .
It is however not necessary here to enlarge on distinctions which will hereafter be strongly supported by facts , when clusters of stars come to be considered .
I shall only add , that in the subordinate bodies of the solar system itself , we have already instances , in miniature , as it may be called , of the principle whereby the laws of attraction are applicable to the solution of the most complicated phenomena of the heavens , by means of revolutions round empty centres .
For , although both the earth and its moon are retained in their orbits by the sun , yet their mutual subordinate system is such , that they perform secondary monthly revolutions round a centre without a body placed in it .
The same indeed , though under very narrow limits , may be said of the sun and each planet itself .
That no insulated stars , of nearly an equal size and distance , can appear double to us , may be proved thus .
I , et Arcturus and Lyra be the stars ; these , by the rule of insulation , which we must now suppose can only take place when their distance from each other is not less than that of Sirius from us , if very accurately placed , would be seen under an angle of 60 degrees from each other .
They really are at about 59 ?
0 Now , in order to make these stars appear to us near enough to come under the denomination of a double star of the first class , we should remove the earth from them at least 41253 times farther than Sirius is from us .
But the space-penetrating power of a 7-feet reflector , by which my observations on double stars ' have been made , cannot entitle us to see stars at such an immense distance ; for , even the 40-feet telescope , as has been shown , * can only reach stars of the 1342d magnitude .
It follows , therefore , .
that these stars could not remain visible in a 7-feet reflector , if they were so far removed as to make their angular distance less than about 244 minutes ; nor could even the 4o-feet telescope , under the same circumstances of removal , show them , unless they were to be seen at least Q2 minutes asunder .
, Moreover , this calculationl is made on a supposition that the stars of which a double star is composed , might be as small as any that can possibly be perceived ; but if , on the contrary , they should still appear of a considerable size , it will then be so much the more evident that such stars cannot have any great real distance , and that , consequently , insulated stars cannot appear double , if they are situated at equal distances from us .
If , however , their arrangement should be such as has been mentioned before , then , one of them being far behind the other , an apparent double star may certainly be produced ; but here the appearance of proximity would be deceptive ; and the object so circumstanced could not be classed in the list of binary systems .
However , as we must grant , that in ; particular situations stars apparently double may be composed of such as are insulated , it cannot be improper to consult calculation , in order to see whether it be likely that the 700 double stars I have given in two catalogues , as well as many more I have since collected , should be of that kind .
Such an inquiry , though not very material to our present purpose , will hereafter be of use to us , when we come to consider more complicated systems .
For , if it can be shown that the odds are very much against the casual production of double stars , the same argument will be still more forcible , when applied to treble , quadruple , or multiple compositions .
Let us take ' Aquarii , for an instance of computation .
This star is admitted , by FLAMSTEED , DE LA CAILLE , BRADLEY , and MAYER , to be of the 4th magnitude .
The two stars that compose it being equal in brightness , each of them may be supposed to shine with half the light of the whole lustre .
This , according to our way of reckoning magnitudes , * would make them 4m x/ = 523m ; that is , of between the 6th and 5th magnitude each .
Now , the light we receive from a star being as the square of its diameter directly , and as the square of its distance inversely , if one of the stars of ' Aquarii be farther off than the stars of between the 6th and 5th magnitude are from us , it must be so much larger in diameter , in order to give us an equal quantity of light .
Let it be at the distance of the stars of the 7th magnitude ; then its diameter will be to the diameter of the star which is nearest to us as 7 to 5- , and its bulk as 1,885 to i ; which is almost double that of the nearest star .
Then , putting the number of stars we call of between the 6th and , th magnitude at 450 , we shall have 686 of the 7th magnitude to combine with them , so that they may make up a double star of the first class , that is to say , that the two stars may not be more than 5 " asunder .
The surface of the globe contains 34o361S !
547 circular spaces , each of 5 " in diameter ; so that each of the 686 stars will have 49615357 of these circles in which it might be placed ; but , of all that number , a single one would only be the proper situation in which it could make up a double star with one of the 450 given stars .
But these odds , which are above 75 ' millions to one against the composition of 'Aquarii , are extremely increased by our foregoing calculation of the required size of the star , which must contain nearly double the mass allotted to other stars of the 7th magnitude ; of which , therefore , none but this one can be proper for making up the required double star .
If the stars of the 8th and gth magnitudes , of which there will be 896 and 1134 , should be taken in , by way of increasing the chance in favour of the supposed composition of our double star , the advantage intended to be obtained by the addition of numbers , will be completely counteracted by the requisite uncommon bulk of the star which is to serve the purpose ; for , one of the 8th magnitude , ought to be more than 2 ?
times bigger than the rest ; and , if the composition were made by a star of the 9th magnitude , no less than four times the bulk of the other star which is to enter the composition of the double star would answer the purpose of its required brightness .
Hence therefore it is evident , that casual situations will not account for the multiplied phenomena of double stars , and that consequently their existence must be owing to the influence of some general law of nature ; now , as the mutual gravitation of bodies towards each other is quite sufficient to account for the union of two stars , we are authorised to ascribe such combinations to that principle .
It will not be necessary to insist any further on arguments drawn from calculation , as I shall soon communicate a series of observations made on double stars , whereby it will be seen , that many of them have actually changed their situation with regard to each other , in a progressive course , denoting a periodical revolution round each other ; and that the motion of some of them is direct , zwhile that of others is retrograde .
Should these observations be found sufficiently conclusive , we may already have their periodical times near enough to calculate , within a certain degree of approximation , the parallax and mutual distance of the stars which compose these systems , by measuring their orbits , which subtend a visible angle .
Before we leave the subject of binary systems , I should remark , that it evidently appears , that our sun does not enter into a combination with any other star , so as to form one of these systems with it .
This could not take place without our immediately perceiving it ; and , though we may have good reason to believe that our system is not perfectly at rest , yet the causes of its proper motion are more probably to be ascribed to some perturbations arising from the proper motion of neighbouring stars or systems , than to be placed to the account of a periodical revolution round some imaginary distant centre .
III .
Of more complicated sidereal Systems , or treble , quadruple , quintuple , and multiple Stars .
Those who have admitted our arguments for the existence of real double stars , will easily advance a step farther , and allow that three stars may be connected in one mutual system of reciprocal attraction .
And , as we have from theory pointed out , in figures i , 2 , 3 , and 4 , how two stars may be maintained in a binary system , we shall here show that three stars may likewise be preserved in a permanent connection , by revolving in proper orbits about a common centre of motion .
In all cases where stars are supposed to move round an empty centre , in equal periodical times , it may be proved that an imaginary attractive force may be supposed to be lodged in that centre , which increases in a direct ratio of the distances .
For since , in different circles , by the law of centripetal forces , the squares of the periodical times are as the radii divided by the central attractive forces , it follows , that when these periodical times are equal , the forces will be as the radii .
Hence we conclude , that in any system of bodies , where the attractive forces of all the rest upon any one of them , when reduced to a direction as comingfrom the empty centre , can be shown to be in a direct ratio of the distance of that body from the centre , the system may revolve together without perturbation , and remain permanently connected without a central body .
Hence may be proved , as has been mentioned before , that two stars will move round a hypothetical centre of attraction .
For , let it be supposed that the empty centre o , in Fig. i and S , is possessed of an attractive force , increasing in the direct ratio of the distances oa : ob .
Then , since here ao and bo are equal , the hypothetical attractions will be equal , and the bodies will revolve in equal times .
That this agrees with the general law of attractions is proved thus .
The real attraction of b upon a is -- ; and that of a upon'b is -a ; and , since b= a , it will be b a ?
: : " : ao : bo ; which was required .
In Figures 2 and 4 , when the stars a and b are unequal , and their distances from o also unequal , let oa n , and ob m ; and let the mass of matter in a =-m , and in b= n. Then the 3R O attraction of b on a -- , will be to the attraction of a on b ~~a~~~~~~ - .
, as n : mn ; which is again directly as ao : bo .
I proceed now to explain a combination of three bodies , moving round a centre of hypothetical attraction .
Fig. 5 contains a single orbit , wherein three equal bodies ab c , placed at equal distances , may revolve permanently .
For , the real attraction of b on a will be expressed by -b ; but this , reduced to the direction a o , will be only b byi direction ao , will be only b- ; for , the attraction in the direcb tion ba is to that in the direction by , parallel to ao , as to b^ .
, The attraction also of c on a is equal to that of b on a ; ab ' therefore the whole attraction on a , in a direction towards o , will be expressed by -2bY .
In the same manner we prove , that the attraction of a and c on b , in the direction bo , is 2aby ; and that of a and b on c , in the direction co , is b. Hence , ab and ab3 c being equal , the attractions in the directions ao bo and co will also be equal ; and , consequently , in the direct ratio of these distances .
Or rather , the hypothetical attractions being equal , it proves that , in order to revolve permanently , ab and c must be equal to each other .
Instead of moving in one circular orbit , the three stars may revolve in three equal ellipses , rcund their common centre of gravity , as in Fig. 6 .
And here we should remark , that this centre of gravity will be situated in the common focus o , of the three ellipses ; and that the absolute attraction towards that focus , will vary in the inverse ratio of the squares of the distances of any one of the stars from that centre , while the relative attractions remaiin n the direct ratio of their several distances 488 from the same centre .
This will be more fully explained , when we come to consider the motion of four stars .
A very singular straight-lined orbit , if so it may be called , may also exist in the following manner .
If a and b , Fig. 7 , are two large equal stars , which are connected together by their mutual gravitation towards each other , and have such projectile motions as would cause them to move in a circular orbit about their common centre of gravity , then may a third small star c , situated in a line drawn through o , and at rectangles to the plane described by the stars a b , fall freely from rest , with a gradually acquired motion to o ; then , passing through the plane of the orbit of the two stars , it will proceed , but with a gradually retarded motion , to a second point of rest d ; and , in this manner , the star c may continue to oscillate between c and d , in a straight line , passing from ( , through the centre o , to d , and back again to c. In order to see the possibility and permanency of this connection the better , let o be the centre of gravity of the three bodies , when the oscillating body is at c ; then , supposing the bodies a and b to be at that moment in the plane p 1 , and admitting m to represent a body equal in mass to the two bodies a b , o will be the common centre of gravity of m and c. Then , by the force of attraction , the body c and the fictitious body m will meet in o ; that is to say , the plane p 1 , of the bodies a b , will now be at p ' 1 ' .
The fictitious body m may then be conceived to move on till it comes to n , while the body c goes to d ; or , which is the same , the plane of the bodies ab will now be in the position p " 1 " , as much beyond the centre of gravity o , as it was on the opposite side m. By this time , both the fictitious body m , now at n , and the real body c , now at d , have lost their motion in opposite directions , and begin to approach to their common centre of gravity o , in which they will meet a second time .
It is evident that the orbit of the two large stars will suffer considerable perturbations , not only in its plane , but also in its curvature , which will not remain strictly circular ; the construction of the system , however , is such as to contain a sufficient compensation for every disturbing force , and will consequently be in its nature permanent .
In order to add an oscillating star , it is not necessary that the two large stars should be so situated as to move in a circular orbit , without the oscillating star .
In Fig. 8 , the stars a and b may have such projectile forces given them as would cause them to describe equal ellipses , of any degree of excentricity .
If now the small star c be added , the perturbations will undoubtedly affect not only the plane of the orbits of the stars , but also their figures , which will become irregular moveable ovals .
The extent also of the oscillations of the star c will be affected ; and will sometimes exceed the limits c d , and sometimes fall short of them .
All these varieties may easily be deduced from what has been already said , when Fig. 7 was considered .
It is however very evident , that this system also must be permanent ; since not only the centre of gravity o will always be at rest , but a o , whatever may be the perturbations arising from the situation of c , will still remain equal to b o. It should be remarked , that the vibratory motion of the star c will differ much from a cometary orbit , even though the latter should be compressed into an evanescent ellipsis .
For , while the former extends itself over the diameter of a globe in which it may be supposed to be inscribed , the hypothetical attractive force being supposed to be placed in its centre , the cometary orbit will only describe a radius of the same globe , on account of its requiring a solid attractive centre .
After what has been said , it will hardly be necessary to add , that with the assistance of any proper one of the combinations pointed out in the four last figures , the appearance of every treble star may be completely explained ; especially when the different inclinations of the orbits of the stars , to the line of sight , are taken into consideration .
If we admit of treble stars , we can have no reason to oppose more complicated connections ; and , in order to form an idea how the laws of gravitation may easily support such systems , I have joined some additional delineations .
A very short explanation of them will be sufficient .
Fig. 9 ( Plate XVII .
) represents four stars , abc and d , arranged in a line ; a being equal to b , and c equal to d. Then , if ao = bo , and co-= do , the centre of gravity will be in o ; and , with a proper adjustment of projectile forces , the four stars will revolve in two circular orbits round their common centre .
By calculating in the manner already pointed out , it will be found , that when , for instance , ao = i , co = $ , and c=d= i , then the mass of matter in a= b , will be required to be equal to 1,3492 .
It is not necessary that the projectile force of the four stars should be such as will occasion them to revolve in circles .
The system will be equally permanent when they describe similar ellipses about the common centre of gravity , which will also be the common focus of the four ellipses .
In Fig. io , the stars abc d , revolving in ellipses that are similar , will always describe , at the same time , equal angles in each ellipsis about the centre of hypothetical attraction ; and , when they are removed from abcd to a ' b c ' d ; they will still be situated in a straight 491 line , and at the same proportionate distances from each other as before .
By this it appears , as we have already observed , that the absolute hypothetical force in the situation a ' b ' c ' d ' , compared to what it was when the stars were at abc d , is inversely as the squares of the distances ; but that its comparative exertion on the stars , in their present situation , is still in a direct ratio of their distances from the centre o , just as it was when they were at abc d ; or , to express the same perhaps more clearly , the force exerted on a ' , is to that which was exerted on a as ... .- .
: .
But the force exerted on a is to that exerted ao\ a01o on c , in our present instance , as ao = to co -g ; and still remains in the same ratio when the stars are at a ' and c ' ; for the exertion will here be likewise as a'o 1 to c'o = 3 .
Fig. ii represents four stars in one circular orbit ; and its calculation is so simple , that , after what has been said of Fig. 5 , I need only remark that the stars may be of any size , provided their masses of matter are equal to each other .
It is also evident , that the projectile motion of four equal stars is not confined to that particular adjustment which will make them revolve in a circle .
It will be sufficient , in order to produce a permanent system , if the stars abc d , in Fig. 12 , are impressed with such projectile forces as will make them describe equal ellipses round the common centre o. And , as the same method of calculation which has been explained with Figs. 6 and io may here be used , it will not be necessary to enter into particulars .
Fig. 13 represents four stars , placed so that , with properly adjusted projectile forces , they may revolve in equal times , and in two different circles , round their common centre of gravity o. 49s If ao =bo = 4 , cod =o 5 , and c= d==i , then will the mass of matter in a= b , required for the purpose , be 1,51i6 .
This arrangement , remarkable as it may appear , cannot be made in all situations ' for instance , if the distance ao =-bo were assumed equal to i , that of co =do being 2 , it would be impossible to find such quantities of matter in a and b as would unite the four stars into one system .
As we have shown how the arrangement in Fig. io may be derived from that of Fig. 9 , so it will equally appear , that four stars may revolve in different but similar ellipses round their common centre , as in Fig. 14 .
For here the four stars , when placed at abc d , are exactly in the situation represented in Fig. 13 ; but , on account of different projectile forces , they revolve , not as before in concentric circles , but in similar elliptical orbits .
Fig. 15 represents three stars , ab c , in the situation of Fig. , to which a small oscillating star , d , is added .
The addition of such a star to Fig. 1 , has been sufficiently explained in Fig. 7 ; and , what has been remarked there , may easily be applied to our present figure .
As the fictitious body m , in Fig. 7 , was made to represent the stars a and b , it will now stand for the three stars ab and c. If we suppose these stars to be of an equal magnitude in both figures , the centre of gravity o , of the three stars , will not be so far from m and n as in Fig. 7 ; and the perturbations will be proportionally lessened .
Fig. 16 gives the situation of three stars , ab c , moving in equal elliptical orbits about their common focus o , while the star d performs oscillations between d and e. What has been said in explaining Fig. 8 , will be sufficient to show , that the present arrangement is equally to be admitted among the constructions of sidereal systems that may be permanent .
We have before remarked , that any appearance of treble stars might be explained , by admitting the combinations pointed out in Figs. 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 ; and it must be equally obvious , that quadruple systems , under what shape soever they may show themselves , whether in straight lines , squares , trapezia , or any other seemingly the most irregular configurations , will readily find a solution from one or other of the arrangements of the eight last figures .
More numerous combinations of stars may still take place , by admitting simple and regular perturbations ; for then all sorts of erratic orbits of multiple flexures may have a permanent existence .
But , as it would lead me too far , to apply calculation to them , I forbear entering upon the subject at present .
Before I proceed , it will be proper to remark , that it may possibly occur to many , who are not much acquainted with the arrangement of the numberless stars of the heavens , that what has been said may all be mere useless surmise ; and that , possibly , there may not be the least occasion for any such speculations upon the subject .
To this , however , it may be answered , that such combinations as I have mentioned , are not the inventions of fancy : they have an actual existence ; and , were it necessary , I could point them out by thousands .
There is not a single night when , in passing over the zones of the heavens by sweeping , I do not meet with numerous collections of double , treble , quadruple , quintuple , and multiple stars , apparently insulated from other groups , and probably joined in some small sidereal system of their own .
I do not imagine that I have pointed out 494 the actual manner in which they are held together ; but it will always be a desirable step towards information , if the possibility of such unions , in many different ways , can be laid before us ; and , very probably , those who have more leisure to consider the different combinations of central forces , than a practical astronomer can have , may easily enlarge on what has been laid down in the foregoing paragraphs .
IV .
Of clustering Stars , and the Milky-way .
From quadruple , quintuple , and multiple stars , we are naturally led to a consideration of the vast collections of small stars that are profusely scattered over the milky-way .
On a very slight examination , it will appear that this immense starry aggregation is by no means uniform .
The stars of which it is composed are very unequally scattered , and show evident marks of clustering together into many separate allotments .
By referring to some one of these clustering collections in the heavens , what will be said of them will be much better understood , than if we were to treat of them merely in a general way .
Let us take the space between / and y Cygni for an example , in which the stars are clustering with a kind of division between them , so that we may suppose them to be clustering towards two different regions .
By a computation , founded on observations which ascertain the number of stars in different fields of view , it appears that our space between , and y , taking an average breadth of about five degrees of it , contains more than 331 thousand stars ; and , admitting them to be clustering two different ways , we have 165 thousand for each clustering collection .
Now , as a more particular account of the milky-way will be the subject of a separate paper , I shall only observe , that the above mentioned 3S S milky appearances deserve the name of clustering collections , as they are certainly brighter about the middle , and fainter near their undefined borders .
For , in my sweeps of the heavens , it has been fully ascertained , that the brightness of the milkyway arises only from stars ; and that their compression increases in proportion to the brightness of the milky-way .
We may indeed partly ascribe the increase , both of brightness and of apparent compression , to a greater depth of the space which contains these stars ; but this will equally tend to show their clustering condition : for , since the increase of brightness is gradual , the space containing the clustering stars must tend to a spherical form , if the gradual increase of brightness is to be explained by the situation of the stars .
V. Of Groups of Stars .
From clustering stars there is but a short transition to groups of stars ; they are , however , suffciently distinct to deserve a separate notice .
A group is a collection of closely , and almost equally compressed stars , of any figure or outline ; it contains no particular condensation that might point out the seat of an hypothetical central force ; and is sufficiently separated from neighbouring stars to show that it makes a peculiar system of its own .
It must be remembered , that its being a separate system does not exclude it from the action or influence of other systems .
We are to understand this with the same reserve that has been pointed out , when we explained what we called insulated stars .
The construction of groups of stars is perhaps , of all the objects in the heavens , the most difficult to explain ; much less can we now enter into a detail of the numerous observations I have already made upon this subject .
I therefore proceed in my enumeration .
VI .
Of Clusters of Stars .
These are certainly the most magnificent objects that can be seen in the heavens .
They are totally different from mere groups of stars , in their beautiful and artificial arrangement : their form is generally round ; and the compression of the stars shows a gradual , and pretty sudden accumulation towards the centre , where , aided by the depth of the cluster , which we can have no doubt is of a globular form , the condensation is such , that the stars are sufficiently compressed to produce a mottled lustre , nearly amounting to the semblance of a nucleus .
A centre of attraction is so strongly indicated , by all the circumstances of the appearance of the cluster , that we cannot doubt a single moment of its existence , either in a state of real solidity , or in that of an empty centre , possessed of an hypothetical force , arising from the joint exertion of the numerous stars that enter into the composition of the cluster .
The number of-observations I have to give relating to this article , in which my telescopes , especially those of high spacepenetrating power , have been of the greatest service , of course can find no room in this enumeration .

Of Nebule .
These curious objects , which , on account of their great distance , can only be seen by instruments of great space-penetrating power , are perhaps all to be resolved into the three last mentioned species .
Clustering collections of stars , for instance , may easily be supposed sufficiently removed to present 497 us with the appearance of a nebula of any shape , which , like the real object of which it is the miniature , will seem to be gradually brighter in the middle .
Groups of stars also may , by distance , assume the semblance of nebulous patches ; and real clusters of stars , for the same reason , when their composition is beyond the reach of our most powerful instruments to resolve them , will appear like round nebula that are gradually much brighter in the middle .
On this occasion I must remark , that with instruments of high space-penetrating powers , such as my 40-feet telescope , nebulae are the objects that may be perceived at the greatest distance .
Clustering collections of stars , much less than those we have mentioned before , may easily contain 50000 of them ; and , as that number has been chosen for an instance of calculating the distance at which one of the most remote objects might be still visible , * I shall take notice of an evident consequence attending the result of the computation ; which is , that a telescope with a power of penetrating into space , like my 40-feet one , has also , as it may be called , a power of penetrating into time past .
To explain this , we must consider that , from the known velocity of light , it may be proved , that when we look at Sirius , the rays which enter the eye cannot have been less than 6 years and 4months coming from that star to the observer .
Hence it follows , that when we see an object of the calculated distance at which one of these very remote nebulae may still be perceived , the rays of light which convey its image to the eye , must have been more than nineteen hundred and ten thousand , that is , almost two millions of years on their way ; and that , consequently , so many years ago , this object must already have had an existence in the sidereal heavens , in order to send out those rays by which we now perceive it .
VIII .
Of Stars with Burs , or Stellar Nebul .
Situated as we are , at an immense distance from the remote parts of the heavens , it is not in , the power of telescopes to resolve many phenomena we can but just perceive , which , could we have a nearer view of them , might probably show themselves as objects that have long been known to us .
A stellar nebula , perhaps , may be a real cluster of stars , the whole light of which is gathered so nearly into one point , as to leave but just enough of the light of the cluster visible to produce the appearance of burs .
This , however , admits of a doubt .
IX .
Of milky Nebulosity .
The phenomenon of milky nebulosity is certainly of a most interesting nature : it is probably of two different kinds ; one of them being deceptive , namely , such as arises from widely extended regions of closely connected clustering stars , contiguous to each other , like the collections that construct our milky-way .
The other , on the contrary , being real , and possibly at no very great distance from us .
The changes I have observed in the great milky nebulosity of Orion , 23 years ago , and which have also been noticed by other astronomers , cannot permit us to look upon this phenomenon as arising from immensely distant regions of fixed stars .
Even HUYGENS , the discoverer of it , was already of opinion that , in viewing it , we saw , as it were , through an opening into a region of light.* Much more would he be convinced now , when changes in its shape and lustre have been seen , that its light is not , like that of the milky-way , composed of stars .
To attempt even a guess at what this light may be , would be presumptuous .
If it should be surmised , for instance , that this nebulosity is of the nature of the zodiacal light , we should then be obliged to admit the existence of an effect without its cause .
An idea of its phosphorical condition , is not more philosophical , unless we could show from what source of phosphorical matter , such immeasurable tracts of luminous phenomena could draw their existence , and permanency ; for , though minute changes have been observed , yet a general resemblance , allowing for the difference of telescopes , is still to be perceived in the great nebulosity of Orion , even since the time of its first discovery .
X. Of nebulous Stars .
The nature of these remarkable objects is enveloped in much obscurity .
It will probably require ages of observations , before we can be enabled to form a proper estimate of their condition .
That stars should have visible atmospheres , of such an extent as those of which I have given the situation in this and my former catalogues , is truly surprising , unless we attribute to such atmospheres , the quality of self-luminous milky nebulosity .
We can have no reason to doubt of the starry nature of the central point ; for , in no respect whatever does its appearance differ from that of a star of an equal magnitude ; but , when the great distance of such stars is taken into consideration , the real extent of the surrounding nebulosity is truly wonderful .
A very curious one of this kind will be found in the 4th class , No. 69 , of the annexed catalogue .
JVoo XI .
Planetary Nebulae .
This seems to be a species of bodies that demands a particular attention .
To investigate the planetary nature of these nebula , is not an easy undertaking .
If we admit them to contain a great mass-of matter , such as that of which our sun is composed , and that they are , like the sun , surrounded by dense luminous clouds , it appears evidently that the intrinsic brightness of these clouds must be far inferior to those of the sun .
A part of the sun 's disk , equal to a circle of 15 " in diameter , would far exceed the greatest lustre of the full moon ; whereas , the light of a planetary nebula , of an equal size , is hardly equal to that of a star of the 8th or gth magnitude .
If , on the other hand , we should suppose them to be groups , or clusters of stars , at a distance sufficiently great to reduce them to so small an apparent diameter , we shall be at a loss to account for their uniform light , if clusters ; or for their circular forms , if mere groups of stars .
Perhaps they may be rather allied to nebulous stars .
For , should the planetary nebula with lucid centres , of which the next article will give an account , be an intermediate step between planetary nebula and nebulous stars , the appearances of these different species , when all the individuals of them are fully examined , might throw a considerable light upon the subject .
XII .
Of planetary Nebula with Centres .
In my second catalogue of nebulae , a single instance of a planetary nebula with a bright central point was mentioned ; and , in the annexed one , No. 73 of the 4th class , is another of very nearly the same diameter , which has also a lucid , though DCCC II .
3T 501 not quite so regular a centre .
From several particularities observed in .
their construction , it would seem as if they were related to nebulous stars .
If we might suppose that a gradual condensation of the nebulosity about a nebulous star could take place , this would be one of them , in a very advanced state of compression .
A further discussion of this point , however , must be reserved to a future opportunity .
