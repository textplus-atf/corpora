Observations within the Antarctic Circle in the Summer of 1840 , 1841 .
IN the present number of these Contributions , I have the pleasure of laying before the Royal Society the magnetic observations made by Captain JAMES CLARK Ross , and the Expedition under his command , in the first of the three voyages in which these researches have been prosecuted within the Antarctic Circle ; and I gladly avail myself of the opportunity which the occasion affords , of congratulating the Society on the successful completion of the labours and on the approaching return , of an Expedition , in which the Fellows individually , and as a body , have taken so strong an interest .
A large portion of the observations contained in this number were made in southern latitudes never before reached by man ; and nearly the whole in ; a part of the globe extremely difficult of access , but containing within itself a field for researches peculiarly needed for completing and perfecting , in the words of HALLEY , C the abstruse theory of terrestrial magnetism .
" In presenting to the Royal Society this portion of the results of an arduous enterprise , undertaken at their recommendation , it appears no improper departure from the usual tone of these commlunications , to allude very briefly to the causes which , under Providence , have conduced to its safe and successful issue ; to the admirable preparation and equipment of the vessels on the part of the Government , to the high qualities of its Commander , manifested in conducting to its close , almost without an accident , and to the fullest accomplishment of its objects , a service of such duration and peculiar hazard , and to the excellent spirit in which the Commander has been seconded by Captain CROZIER , and supported by the officers and seamen who have been their worthy associates .
Viewed merely as an expedition of discovery , its voyages must ever rank high in the annals of those maritime aclievements of which our country is proud ; but as a scientific expedition , which is its more proper character , as well as that in which the Royal Society must regard it with the greatest satisfaction , its best praise will undoubtedly be found in the record of its performances ; and I hasten therefore to enter on that portion of them which I am now enabled to present to the Society .
The peculiar feature in the magnetic survey of the portion of the southern hemisphere now under notice is , that it was conducted almost exclusively on board ship , the observations being subject to the disturbance occasioned by the ship 's iron , in a part of the globe where the effect of this influence becomes excessive .
The first consideration , therefore , must be to investigate the corrections which it is necessary to employ in compensation .
The analysis of the effects produced by the iron of a vessel , and the theory of their corrections , have been given by the late M. POISSON , in a memoir read in 1838 , and published in the Transactions of the Acad6mie des Sciences , entitled " M6moire sir les deviations de la Boussole produites par le fer des Vaisseaux .
" In cases in which the disturbance is due , partly to the magnetism induced by the earth 's influence in the soft iron of the vessel , and partly to permanent magnetism acquired and retained by harder portions of her iron , the complexity of the source from whence the disturbance originates renders its correction very difficult .
But in wood-built ships , when proper precautions are taken in regard to the place in the ship in which the instrument is used in observation , the disturbing influence is generally found to be that of induced magnetism alone : and in this case the correction may be obtained with tolerable facility* .
The disturbance produced by the iron of the Erebus and Terror appearing to be of the latter class , I requested my friend Mr. ARCHIBALD SMITH , Fellow of Trinity College , Cambridge , who in his academic course obtained the highest distinction conferred by the University , to draw out from M. POISSON'S fundamental equations , applicable to induced magnetism , the most convenient and practical formulae for computing the corrections of the three magnetic elements , for the use of nautical men , and of others who might be engaged in reducing magnetic observations made at sea .
He has obligingly firnished me with the following memorandum:"At a given geographical position let p represent the total magnetic intensity of the earth ; 8 the dip , which is considered positive when the north end of the needle dips below the horizontal plane , negative when it inclines above it ; t the azimuth of the ship 's head , or the angle between the principal section of the ship and the magnetic meridian , which is considered positive when the ship 's head is to the west of the magnetic north , negative when to the east .
Let P ' , 8 ' , ' , be the values of the same elements shown by a needle whose centre is at a given place in the ship , when affected by the magnetism induced in the soft iron of the ship by the magnetism of the earth .
M. POIssoN has shown that if the dimensions of the needle are very small compared to its distance from the iron by which it is affected , the following equations are true ; 'c cos [ ' cos [ A ' cos cos +B cos sin +C sin ] , ' cos 8 ' sin '= p [ D cos d cos g+ E ' cos 0 sin ~+F sin d ] , ' sin 8 ' =p [ G cos 0 cos g+H cos 0 sin $+ K ' sin 0 ] .
" In these equations , A ' , B , C , D , E ' , F , G , H , K ' are constants which depend only on the distribution of the iron in the ship relatively to the position of the needle and the plane of the horizon , and which continue the same for every geographical position of the ship , while the distribution of the iron within the ship , and the inclination of the ship to the horizon , remain the same .
" If the centre of the needle is placed in the principal section of the ship , and the iron is symmetrically distributed on each side of that section , it will easily be seen that for values of $ equal in magnitude and opposite in sign , the corresponding values of p ' are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign , and the corresponding values of p ' and 8 ' are respectively equal in magnitude and the same in sign .
These results necessarily imply that B , D , F and H are equal to zero .
The equations in this case become I ' cos ' cos '= -p [ A ' cos 8 cos C+C sin 8 ] , ' cos 0 ' sin = p.E'cos 0 sin , ' sin 8 ' = [ G cos 0 cos + K ' sin ] .

A table of the affected dip , and of the dip corrections on each course , may then be calculated from ( 14 .

) must not be used when the ship 's course is nearly north or south , and that ( 13 .
) must not be used when the ship 's course is nearly east or west , and that the values of ~ should be tabular , not observed .
" The constants may also be determined from observations of the total intensity , by means of the first four equations , and tables for the correction of the observed intensities may be constructed by means of these equations .
For this purpose , equation ( 3 .
) should be used when the dip is large , and the others when the dip is small .

Before the Expedition quitted England , a suitable position in the midship line was chosen for magnetic observations on board ship , and the effect of the seip 's attraction on a standard compass placed in that spot , was ascertained by observations with the ship 's head turned successively on each of the thirty-two principal points .
This was done in September 1839 at Gillingham near Chatham , where 0 , or the Inclination , was at that epoch 69 ?

We may therefore safely employ , in computing the corrections , the more simple formulae which are applicable under this condition .
To obtain the constants a and b of these formulae we may arrange equations on the several points , from the observations in the Table , of the form cos g sin b sin g cos =a tan d sin ' .

After the arrival of the Expedition at Hobarton , and before it sailed to the Antarctic Circle , a similar series of observations was made in the Erebus , on the 29th October 1840 , and again repeated on her return to Hobarton the following autumn , viz. on the 29th June 1841 .
The south end of the needle being now the one which dipped below the horizon ( d being 700 40 ' ) , the deviation of the compass was found to take place in the contrary direction to that which had been observed at Gillingham , the disturbance being towards the west as the ship 's head went round from north by east to south , and towards the east as her head passed from south through west to north .
The line of no deviation was not found to correspond accurately with the north and south points of the compass on either of the occasions at Hobarton , but in 1840 coincided more nearly with the north by west and south by east , and in 1841 with the north by east and south by west .
We may perhaps ascribe with probability irregularities of this nature to slight modifications in the distribution of the iron at different periods , which we cannot but view as of not unlikely occurrence ; for example , such as might be occasioned by the ship being secured at different times by the starboard or the larboard chain cable .
In looking through the observations of the Erebus , it is evident that there was no systematic or constant deviation of the plane of the ship 's attraction from that of her principal section ; but that the points of no disturbance were sometimes a little on the one side , and sometimes a little on the other , of the north and south points .
It appears , therefore , not improper to class these irregularities with those others of accidental occurrence which occasion small discordances in partial results , and are usually ranged under the general technical head of errors of observation .
If , further , we compare generally the deviations in 1840 with those of April 1841 , the latter appear systematically rather the more considerable in amount .
Viewed as a single fact , this circumstance might be regarded simply as indicating that some change had taken place in the interim in the arrangement and distribution of the ship 's iron , and an easy and natural explanation might appear to be afforded .
It is however one of several facts which have presented themselves in the course of a careful examination of the observations of the first two years of Captain Ross 's expedition , which seem to point to the possibility of a somewhat different cause , viz. that when 152 a ship changes her magnetic latitude , the corresponding change in the magnetism of the ship , or more strictly in that portion of it which is derived from induction , follows , but does not always , or altogether , take place instantaneously .
It would accord with this supposition , that the disturbance of the compass should be less in the Erebus on her first arrival at Hobarton in 1840 , than on her return there in 1841 , because in 1840 she had recently passed through the lowest magnetic latitudes , and in 1841 she came immediately from the highest .
The observations in 1840 give a less value for a tan 0 than those of 1841 , and taking the dip at Hobarton as the value of 0 , to which the induced magnetism of the ship on both occasions should strictly correspond , we should have a less value for a in 1840 than in 1841 ; whereas if with the same dip we take a mean between the disturbances of the compass on the first arrival and on the return , by which we may be conceived to neutralize in a great measure the temporary influences which have been supposed , we find the value of a to be almost identical with the result of the former experiments at Gillingham .
From this accordance in the value of the constant in dips which differ so greatly as from + 690 to 700 , we should infer the probability , -first , that the local attraction of the Erebus was due to induced magnetism alone , the influence of any portions of iron which , in the strict sense of the term , were permanently magnetic , being insensible ; and secondly , that no material change affecting the standard compass had taken place in the distribution of her iron .
These inferences are by no means inconsistent with the supposition above suggested , that some portions of her iron might be of a quality intermediate between that of perfectly soft iron which undergoes instantaneous change , and that of iron which acquires permanent magnetism , and that such portions should be liable , in regard to their magnetic condition , to be more or less in arrear of the ship 's magnetic position .
I abstain from entering further into this question at present , because a fitter opportunity of doing so will be afforded when the whole of the observations of the Expedition shall be collected , including those which have yet to be made at Rio de Janeiro on the return from the high latitudes of the south , and in England after passing through the low magnetic latitudes of the equatorial region .
Should it prove that the induced magnetism of a ship due to any particular dip requires time for its full development , more or less according to the various quality of her iron , the corrections to be applied may possibly in some ships be considerably complicated thereby : fortunately in the Erebus the difference in the amount of the disturbance on the two occasions at Hobarton , which gave rise to this discussion , is not of any serious consequence ; and we may employ without any material inconvenience for our present purpose the mean of the two series as applicable generally between their respective dates , for which interval we specially desire the corrections .
153 Employing the same formula as before , and forming equations from the observations on the twenty-eight points , being all the points excepting the north , south , east and west , we obtain 10'1036 b=+ 9-9673 b =+ *9865 ; and from the sum of the thirty equations , including those at east and west , we have + 57-89 a=+ 1-0439 + '537 b , 1-0439 + -5297 +a= 57'89 =+ 0272 .
On the passage from Hobarton to the Antarctic Circle , the Expedition stopped at Auckland Island for the purpose of observing on the term day of November 1840 .
The Erebus was not swung at this station , but with the value of d observed on shore 730 10 ' , and the declination observed on board whilst at anchor , with the ship 's head on the east and west points , and on the E.N.E. and W.N.W. points , we may obtain a satisfactory value for a. On the supposition of the symmetrical distribution of the iron on either side of the longitudinal midship section , the deviation occasioned by it should be the same in amount , but with opposite signs , at east and west , and also at E.N.E. and W.N.W. ; the amount , however , being slightly different at east and west from that at E.N.E. and W.N.W.

The mean of the two pairs of observations gives a=+ *0263 .
Whilst within the Antarctic Circle only a single opportunity occurred of observing the inclination otherwise than on board , and thus of obtaining a from a tan d by having an assured value of 0 .
This was on the 8th of January 1841 , in lat. 680 30 ' , long .
176§ 35 ' , where the inclination observed on the ice with a needle in which the observation was complete by the reversal of the poles , was found to be 830-35 ' .
The declination was observed on board on the same afternoon and following morning , as nearly as could be in the same geographical position , with the ship 's head on several points , from which we may select for a determination of a those nearest to the east and west points .

POISSON'S fundamental equations , which are based on the hypothesis of induced magnetism only , in computing corrections for the observations made on board that ship .

9841 With these values of a and b , a table of double entry was formed , having for arguments &lt; ' and 0 ; ' being the compass direction of the ship 's head when an azimnuth was observed , and 0 the inclination taken from the chart formed from the observations of that element on board ship , corrected in the manner that will be shown hereafter ; the corrections for the ship 's local attraction in the general Table of Declinations observed in the Erebus have been taken from the Table thus formed .
156 In geographical positions , where the indication made a very near approximation to 900 , and when azimuths observed on the same day at places sufficiently near to each other included observations on the east and west points , or on points but little removed from them , on which the corrections for the deviation might have the same , or nearly the same , value , but with opposite signs , the inclination with which the corrections have been computed has been derived from the azimuths themselves in preference to being taken from the chart .
In such cases , and when a and b have been elsewhere satisfactorily determined for the ship , the amount of disturbance which her iron produces on the compass needle furnishes itself a measure of the inclination , exceeding in precision that of the dipping needle used on board .
If the ship 's magnetism should have already conformed to the terrestrial dip , the inclination corresponding to the disturbance of the compass is that belonging to the geographical position , and the ship herself , with merely her compass needle , would become in such rare situations an inclinometer of great delicacy .
But if the change in the mtagnetism of the ship from that due to a former magnetic locality be not yet fully developed , the inclination thus furnished by the compass needle is on that account also preferable to that which might be taken from the chart , or to the dip observed with thie dipping needle either on board or on shore , for the correction of other azimuths observed at the same time .
Whenever the inclination used for the declination corrections has been thus derived , a notice is annexed in its proper place in the general table .
It may be useful to give an example , and I select for that purpose the observations on the afternoon of the 16th February 1841 , when , from the amount of the declination ( 112 ?
or 113 ?
) , the Expedition had without doubt penetrated to the south of the latitude of the magnetic pole ; the particular observations are as follow : Latitude .

In the extreme circumstances to which the Expedition had attained , when by reason of the great amount of dip , the terrestrial force acting on the compass needle , and directing it to one part of the horizon in preference to another , was reduced to W-1th part of the whole atmount of the terrestrial magnetic force in the same locality , the degree of accordance which was still preserved assuredly surpasses expectation* .
The result at S.W. 4 W. is the only one which presents an excessive discordance ; and after a careful examination of the whole of the observations which the general table contains , it must be regarded * The compass used in the Erebus was the first of the new naval compasses made under the direction of a Committee appointed by the Admiralty " ' for the improvement of ships ' compasses .
" The magnet was composed of several thin plates of clock-spring suitably arranged , giving very considerable magnetic force , with a suspension improved both in mode and materials .
This ' compass appears to have answered remarkably well in the very trying circumstances in which it was employed .
Captain Ross was himself the Chairman of the Committee , which gave its services gratuitously : the other members were Captain BEAUFORT , R.N. , Mr. CHRISTIE , Major JERvIs , Captain EDWARD JOHNSON , R.N. , and Lieut.-Colonel SABINE .
158 as a case of very unusual observation error .
Were we to omit this result , the mean would become112§ 39 ' .
When the corrections for local attraction become so great , it is necessary to be very accurate in noting the direction of the ship 's head at the same instant that the azimuth is observed , as at the points where the changes of 3 for changes of c ' are very great , an error of a degree in the direction of the ship 's head will make nearly the same error in the correction ; on such occasions therefore the result is liable to an additional source of observation error of serious magnitude .
We have seen that when the inclination is87§ 53 ' , the sum of the deviations at east and west amounted to 920 26 ' ; with 10 ' increase in the dip , their joint amount would have become 126§ 52 ' .
The scale which the compass needle presents for the deduction of the inclination is consequently a very large one , when the inclination is so great as that which we are now considering ; and it continuies to increase in magnitude , until the compass ceases altogether to indicate the direction of the horizontal component of the terrestrial force , and points unchangingly , under every alteration of the ship 's head , to the direction of the general resultant of the ship .
The terrestrial dip observed with a dipping-needle on board on the 16th of February , and corrected for the ship 's attraction , was 88§ 20 ' ; that corresponding to the magnetism of the ship was , as we have seen , 87§ 53 ' , being a little in arrear , in a magnetic sense , of her then position .
For the constants c and d in the formula for the correction of the inclination , we have to take into account , in the first instance , a series of observations of the inclination with the ship 's head successively on the sixteen principal points of the compass , made on board the Erebus at Hobarton in November 1840 , before her departure for the Antarctic Circle , and a similar series made at the same place in June 1841 on her return from the south .
The inclination observed on shore was 70§ 40 ' .

+-1 26-4 In the Terror , as in the Elebus , the disturbance had changed its sign in passing from the northern to the southern hemisphere : the symmetrical distribution of the iron on either side of the principal axis of the ship continued as at Gillingham , the observations showing only those very small differences in the exact points of no disturbance , which have been remarked in the Erebus , and which we may be content to view as accidental differences .
From these observations , pursuing the usual courise , we obtain b =+ -9873 , and a+ '0292 .
Here also , as in the case of the Erebus , the observations on the first arrival at Hobarton give a somewhat less value for a tan 0 than those at Gillingharn .
It is possible that a similar series of experiments may have been repeated in the Terror on the return to the same station in 1841 , but no irecord of it has been received in England , and the obserivations of 1840 are expressly referred to , in a note appended to them , as furnishing the corrections for the declinations observed between the months of October 1840 and April 1841 .
I think it not improbable that if the ship were swung in 1841 , the resulting value of a tan 0 will prove , as in the Erebus , to be somewhat greater than in 1840 , and that the mean value of a at Hobarton will thereby come into a closer accord with its value at Gillingham .
The practical effect of so small a difference is however unimportant , and I have taken a in round numbers for the declinations under consideration =+ -030 , and b -= + *9875 , and have computed with these values the Tables from which the corrections for the Terror 's declinations have been taken .
Part of the materials required for the correction of the observations of inclination and intensity , made in the Terror during the voyage under notice , not having yet reached England , the deduction of the constants c , d , and A ' for that ship has been postponed .
Index Correction of Needle R. F. 4 for the Observations of the Inclination in the Erebus.-The observations of the inclination at sea on board the " Erebus , " were made with Mr. Fox 's apparatus for determining the magnetic inclination and intensity , and one needle , R. F. 4 , was used throughout the observations which are now under consideration .
The poles were not reversed ; the circle was used with the face east only , and the needle with its marked side towards the observer .
An index correction is therefore required for all the sea observations , and must be sought by comparing the inclination shown by the same circle and needle when observed with in the same manner on shore , at stations where the inclination was otherwise determined in an independent and complete manner , viz. by needles of which the poles were reversed , and the needle and circle used in the eight ordiiary positions .
The determinations of this description made by the Expedition at the'Magnetic Observatory at Van Diemen Island in 1840 and 1841 at Auckland Island in November and December 1840 , at Campbell 's Island in December 1840 , and on the ice in lat. 68§ 28 ' , long .
176§ 32 ' , on the 8th of January 184 1 , -furnishing the required comparison , were as follows:164 The inclinations observed at the four preceding stations with needle R. F. 4 , with the face of the circle east , and the marked side of the needle facing the observer , were as follows : Van Diemen Island 71 06'5 ; true inclination70 40'7 ; index correction 25*8 Auckland Island. .
73 41*3 ; true inclination 73 10'4 ; index correction -30'9 Campbell Island. .

F. 4 , in order to give the true or correct inclination , as it would have been observed by a needle in which the complete process of observation had been gone through .
Elements of Calculation of the Intensity Observations.-Of the intensity observations made with Mr. Fox 's apparatus on board the Erebus , during the period under consideration , a large proportion was of the angles of deflection produced by deflecting magnets .
A spare needle belonging to the apparatus was used as a deflector , and was fitted into a cylindrical case having screws at both ends , so that the needle could be applied either as " deflector N " with its north pole opposite that division of the circle which the north pole of the dipping needle had previously indicated as the dip , -or as " deflector S " with its south pole similarly applied to the opposite division of the circle .
The deflectors belonging to the apparatus , being too weak to produce sufficient deflections when used separately , were employed only conjointly , and are designated as " deflectors N and S. " The angles of deflection varied in different localities during the voyage in round numbers as follows : deflector S from 50 ?
to 45 ?
; deflector N from 48 ?
to 43 ?
; and N and S from 23 ?
to 20 ? .
To obtain the equivalent weight to the deflecting &lt; force of the deflectors at these angles , we have comparative observations of the angles produced by the deflectors and by weights at Hobarton , Auckland , and Campbell Islands , on the ice on the 8th January in lat. 68§ 28 ' , long .
176§ 32 ' , and on five different occasions on board ship when the weather and other circumstances were favourable , viz. on February 8th and 10th , March 22nd , April 1st and 6th .
These were exclusive of an attempt on the 1st of February , which failed on account of the ship having too much motion .
Hobarton is necessarily the primary station of the whole series of observations made in this portion of the voyage , being the only station at which an independent determination of the intensity has been made .
It is also very suitable for a base station , because we may expect that the absolute as well as relative intensity will be determined with great precision at the magnetic observatory established there , and will ultimately furnish a correction , should one be needed , for the provisional value which must for the present be employed .
167 Captain Ross commenced the experiments for measuring the absolute horizontal intensity at Hobarton , by obtaining five results with the large magnets of his observatory magnetometers on different days whilst the Expedition was refitting there .
The details of these will be published with the other magnetometric observations of the voyage ; the results , which have been computed by Lieutenant GOODENOUGH of the Royal Artillery from the data received from Captain Ross , are as follows : October 13 , 1840 ... . .

18 188 1830 The closeness in the accordance of he mean results by the two methods can only be viewed as accidental , because the probable error of the absolute determination , estimated from the differences in the partial results , is far greater than the difference of the two methods ; but it fully warrants 1 82 being now taken as a provisional value of the total intensity at Hobarton , as the base station of the observations which form the subject of this number , regarding 1 82 +e as the true value , and e as a small correction to be determined hereafter , applicable to the whole series .
The weights employed in deflecting the intensity needle were from half a grain to six grains .
It was soon found that half a grain was too small to give satisfactory results , and observations with that weight were discontinued .
I have not therefore taken the observationls made with it into account , except at Hobarton , where they * Since these pages were written I have received the results of twenty-two monthly determinations of the absolute horizontal intensity at the magnetic observatory at Hobarton ( ten in 1841 and twelve in 1842 ) made and computed by Lieutenant KAY , R.N. , and the naval officers under his direction .
The mean in 1841 is 4*553 , the partial results varying from 4'601 to 4-509 ; and the mean in 1842 , 4-513 , the partial results varying from 4'443 to 4'568 .
The discordance in the partial results of these observations is scarcely less than in those of Captain Ross : there is also a considerable disagreement in the means of the three series , which may not improbably be diminished when the particulars of the several observations shall have been carefully examined , though the partial results must still be expected to differ much more widely than could be desired .
It is hoped that such differences will be reduced within much smaller limits by the use of the improved apparatus which has recently been supplied to the Hobarton as well as to the other colonial observatories .

170 General Remarks.-The Tables of the declination observations in the Erebus and Terror , and of the inclination and intensity observations in the Erebus , furnish a full opportunity , for those who may desire it , to examline how far the corrections computed in the manner which has been described fulfil their purpose .
The three charts which accompany this number of the " Contributions , " exhibit to the eye the determinations contained in the Tables , arranged in their respective localities , by which their general harmony may be , in some measure , judged of .
The faint lines , representing the principal curves of the magnetic elements , are drawn in approximate conformity with the observations , and are designed merely to assist the eye in taking a first general view of the results .
When the determinations of the succeeding voyages shall have been laid down in a similar manner on a south polar chart , they will furnish the means of judging of the course of the magnetic curves more comprehensively and accurately , and of tracing them accordingly .
Rather more attention has been bestowed on the lines in the chart of the inclination than in the other two charts , because it has been used for the values of a in the declination-corrections .
Having had experience in drawing similar charts on former occasions , and particularly those of the Magnetic Survey of the British Islands , I have no hesitation in recognising with Captain Ross , that as great , and greater , discrepancies are to be looked for , and must frequently be experienced , in magnetic surveys conducted on land , than in those made at sea .
The chart of the inclination which accompanies this paper , constructed from observations made at sea , and certainly not under the most favourable circumstances , except in the skill of the observers , exhibits by no means a greater measure of discrepancy than the magnetic chlart of Scotland or of Ireland : and it may be further noticed , that the only results which have been excluded altogether from the chart , by reason of their excessive discordance as well with each other as with the general body of results , are some that were made on islands which presented themselves in the course of the voyage .
I cannot close this section without calling the attention of all who take interest in the results of these researches , to the invaluable aid for which magnetical science is indebted to Mr. Fox .
Without his instrument and method , which render observations of inclination and intensity made at sea nearly or altogether equal to those which could be made on land or on ice , such were the difficulties of the navigation , and such the inaccessible thoughl magnificent character of the coast that was discovered , that two of the three charts herewith presented , and especially that of the intensity , must have offered an appearance very different from that which they now exhibit .
To enter into a lengthened comparison of the results now communicated with those of preceding observers , which have been embodied in magnetic maps constructed either directly from the phenomena , or by means of the mathematical theory of M. GAUss , would be to anticipate the more proper opportunity which will present itself , when the whole of the materials collected by the Antarctic Expedition shall be available for the comparison .
A few remarks however on prominent points may be looked for on the present occasion .
1 .
The observations of declination , particularly those which point out the course of the lines of O and of 10 ?
east , indicate a more westerly position than the one assigned by M. Gavss in the " Atlas des Erdmagnetismus " for the spot in which all the lines of declination unite .
The progression of the lines in the southern hemisphere generally , from secular change , is from east to west ; the difference consequently is in the direction in which a change should be found in comparing earlier with more recent determinations .
2 .
The general form of the curves of higher inclination in the southern hemisphere is much more analogous to that in the northern , than appears in M. GAUss 's maps .
For example , the isoclinal line of 85 ?
instead of being nearly circular , as represented in the 3Abtheilung of PI .
XVI .
of the " Atlas des Erdmagnetismus , " is an elongated ellipse , much more nearly resembling in form and dimensions the ellipse of 85 ?
of inclination in the northern hemisphere in the same work , P1 .
XVI .
2te Abtheilung .
The analogy between the two hemispheres in the characteristic feature of the elliptical form of the higher isoclinal lines is the more important to notice , on account of the particular relation which appears to subsist in the northern hemisphere , between the change in the geographical direction of the greater axis of the ellipse , and the secular changes of the inclination generally throughout the hemisphere .
The present direction of the greater axis in the northern hemisphere is nearly N.N.W. and S.S.E. , or that of a line passing through the two foci of maximum intensity .
In the southern hemisphere the present direction of the greater axis differs little from E.S.E. and W.N.W. 3 .
Captain Ross 's observations of the intensity do not appear to indicate the existence anywhere in the southern hemisphere of a higher intensity than would be expressed by 2'1 of the arbitrary scale .
In this respect also the analogy between the two hemispheres appears to be closer than is shown in M. GAUss 's maps , Atlas , P1 .
XVIII .
With respect to the direction of so much of the line of hioghest intensity ( 2'0 ) as it has been possible to draw with any degree of confidence from the observations now communicated , it will be found to be in almost exact parallelism with the isodynamic line of 1-7 in Plate III .
of my memoir 'E On the Variations of the Magnetic Intensity " in the Reports of the British Association for 1838 ; which line was the highest of which the position could be assigned , for any considerable distance , by the aid of the then existing determinations .
172 Observations of the Magnetic Inclination and Intensity made on board Her Majesty 's ship Erebus on the passage from Kerguelen Island to Van Diemen Island in July and August 1840 .
These observations were made with Mr. Fox 's apparatus , and with the same needle F which had been employed in the determinations made at sea on the passage from England to Kerguelen Island , discussed in § 5 and § 6 of these Contributions* .
The inclinations at sea were observed with the face of the circle always to the east : the index correction for needle F in this position of the instrument has been derived by comparing similar observations made with it at the magnetic observatory at Kerguelen Island , with the results obtained at the same spot with other needles which had their poles reversed .
These are contained in the following Table : Observations of the Inclication with needles whose poles were reversed , made at the Magnetic Observatory at Kerguelen Island , July 1840 .

The inclination observed with needle F at the same spot with the face of the circle towards the east was69§ 57'"9 ; whence the index correction is 11'7 .
The intensity of the rmagnetic force was determined in this portion of the voyage , on every day that the weather permitted , by the angles of deflection caused by a deflecting magnet .
The observations were a continuation of the series of which the earlier portion is given in § 5 and § 6 .
The deflecting magnet employed was the deflector S. Tables are given , in the sections referred to , of the values of w ' for this deflector corresponding to angles of deflection from 42 ?
to 25 ?
, derived from a comparison with the deflections produced by weights .
The increase of the terrestrial force , in the passage between Kerguelen and Van Diemen Islands , brought the angle * Philosophical Transactions , 1842 , Art .

2A2 173 of deflection with deflector S down nearly to 20 ? .
The weatiler was too unsettled to adrmit of any comparison being made with the weights at sea , and an accident which befel the needle on or before the arrival at Hobarton prevented the comparison which otherwise would have been made there .
The values of w ' corresponding to the angles of deflection from 250 to 200 have , therefore , been supplied , by continuing the r:lte of progression at which the deflecting force of the magnet S had been found by experiment , in angles from 360 to 25 ?
, to increase as the angle diminished , viz. 0'033 gr. for each degree ; we have thus the following values : Ov'=26 ; gr. v'26 ; w'-2594 v1 = 25 ; w'= 2'628 vt=24 ; w't=2'661 v'=23 ; w'=2694 v ' 22 ; w'= 2727 v'= 21 ; w'= 2760 v'=20 ; w'=-2793 .
At Kerguelen Island we have the angle of deflection with the magnet S= 26§ 21'"3 = v ; the equivalent weight = 2'58 = w ; and ( § 6 .
) I= 1-465 ( London = 1372 ) ; whence in other localities , d sin v I'I w sin v= 2521 u/ cosec v ' , v ' being furnished by the observation and w ' taken from the preceding Table , The last observation recorded to have been made with needle F was on the 1 th of August , 1840 , in lat. 44§ 16 ' , long .

06'-5 , I ' = 1929 uncorrected for the ship 's attraction , or ( the course being E. by N. i N. ) , I ' = 1934 corrected .
On the return of the Expedition from the Antarctic Circle in the following year , the ships regained their former track , and on the 5th of April , 1841 , Captain Ross repeated the observations with different instruments within a few miles of the spot on which he had observed on the 11th of August , 1840 : these observations gave I ' = 1'927 in lat. 45 ?

If we examine the map in which the intensity observations are inserted , we perceive that the direction of the two geographical positions in relation to each other is very nearly that of the isodynamic lines in that quarter ; and if we refer generally to the Tables , we see that the difference in the resulting intensity on the two occasions is within the limits of the differences of partial determinations with the same instrument at one spot .
As far as circumstances permit us to judge , therefore , we may view the observations of the two voyages as forming parts of one connected series .
As the ship 's head during the run under consideration varied but little on any occasion from her direct course , and as that course is one on which the corrections , both of inclination and intensity , are small , I have taken them from the Table computed by means of the constants deduced in the preceding section .
