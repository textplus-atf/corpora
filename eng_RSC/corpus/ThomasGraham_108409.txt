THE experiments on diffusion to be presently described are in continuation of those detailed in my last publication on the subject , the same method of observing being followed without change .
The diffusion is generally made from solutions in four different proportions , so as to exhibit pretty fully the characters of the property in question for each salt , so far as is possible at a constant temperature .
The salts operated upon are of two bases only , potash and soda ; but the acids are considerably varied , so as to include hydrates , carbonates , sulphates , sulphites , hyposulphites , sulphovinates , oxalates , acetates and tartrates .
Salts of almost every class of acids come thus to be represented , either in the present or former series of experiments on diffusion , while at the same time much informlation is elicited respecting the diffusive relation of the two important bases named .
Comparison of Salts of Potash and Soda .
Hydrate of Potash.-Time of diffusion 4-041 days .
The usual number of eight cells of the 1 and 2 per cent. solutions of this substance were diffused , and four cells of the 4 and 8 per cent. solutions .
The whole diffusates of each proportion were then mixed together , and the quantity of hydrate of potash diffused for two cells determined by an alkalimetric experiment , which was always repeated twice .

The numbers for the sulphate of potash and hydrate of potash ( p. 412 ) would probably correspond 32 487 closely at the same temperature , the times of diffusion of the two substances being taken as 2 to 1 .
Sulphate of Soda.-Time of diffusion 9'9 days .

The assumed relation in the times of equal diffusion for salts of potash and soda appears to derive support from the sulphates , particularly in the lower proportions of salt .

The preceding times of diffusion were observed .

2'013 per cent. of sulphate of potash , diffused at 590'8 , in eight cells , gave 11*90 , 11'94 , 1141 , 1171 ; mean 11'74 grs. for two cells ; calculated for 2 per cent. , 11 167 grs. of sulphate of potash in two cells .

Two per cent. of sulphate of soda , density 1-01846 , diffused at 590.6 , in eight cells , gave 1 1158 , I 1156 , 11-94 , 11 97 ; mean 1 1-76 grs. of sulphate of soda in two cells .
488 The present results , from 2 per cent. solutions of these salts , are as follows : Sulphate of potash in 8'083 days at 59 ?
08 ... 11-67 100 Sulphate of soda in 9'9 days at 59 ?
06 ... .
11'76 100'94 The diffusion in the selected times appears therefore to be , as nearly as possible , equal at the present temperatures .
Another experiment may be recorded at present , of which the object was to ascertain the influence of free sulphuric acid upon the diffusion of sulphate of soda .
7 .
Sulphate of soda , 2'02 per cent. , to which an equivalent quantity of sulphuric acid was added , had the density 1-02703 .
This solution , diffused into pure water , in eight cells , at 59 ?
'6 , for the same time as the preceding sulphate of soda , gave a diffusate of 9-70 , 10'06 , 10'17 and 10'29 grs. of sulphate of soda ; mean 10'05 grs. in two cells ; calculated for 2 per cent. , this diffusate becomes 9'95 grs. The presence of one equivalent of sulphuric acid appears therefore to diminish the diffusion of sulphate of soda considerably , namely , from 11'76 to 9.95 grs. , or from 100 to 84'61 .
The free sulphuric acid diffused in the experiment was not determined .
Sulphite of Potash.-It was curious to observe how far this and other salts of the oxygen acids of sulphur correspond with the sulphates .
Time of diffusion 8-083 days .
The diffusate was treated with sulphuric acid and estimated in the form of neutral sulphate of potash .
1-90 per cent. of sulphite of potash , density 1-01753 , diffused at 590.5 , in eight cells , gave 11i36 , 10'72 , 11-22 and 10-90 grs. in two cells ; mean 11-05 grs. in two cells ; calculated for 2 per cent. , 11'63 grs. Making the comparison for 2 per cent. solutions we haveSulphate of potash at 60 ?
-3 ... 1 160 100 Sulphite of potash at 59 ?
05 ... 11'63 100'26 The two salts appear to have the same diffusibility .
Sulphite of Soda.-Time of diffusion 9-9 days .
The diffusate was estimated in the same manner as the preceding salt .
2'26 per cent. of sulphite of soda , density 1'02330 , diffused at 59 ?
06 , in eight cells , gave 12'93 , 13-35 , 13'56 and 13'62 grs. in two cells ; mean 13'37 grs. in two cells ; calculated for 2 per cent. , 11'83 grs. The comparative diffusion of the sulphites of the two bases is as follows : Sulphite of potash in 8'083 days at 59 ?
5 ... 1163 100 Sulphite of soda in 9'9 days at 590'6 ... .
11 83 100'72 The sulphites of potash and soda appear therefore to exhibit the usual relation of these two bases .
Hyposulphite of Potash.-Time of diffusion 8'083 days .
The diffusate was evaporated to dryness with sulphuric acid , ignited and estimated from the sulphate produced .
489 1*925 per cent. of anhydrous hyposulphite of potash , density 1*0150 , diffused at 590.8 , in eight cells , gave 1 166 , 11'67 , 12,01 , 12*26 grs. ; mean 1 190 grs. for two cells ; calculated for 2 per cent. , 12*37 grs. of hyposulphite of potash in two cells .
Comparing this salt with the sulphate of the same base , we haveSulphate of potash at 600 ?
3 ... 11-60 100 Hyposulphite of potash at 59 ?
-8. .
12-37 106*44 A slight error in excess may possibly have been introduced from the circumstance that the hyposulphite of potash employed was not absolutely free from sulphate .
Hyposulphite of Soda.--Time of diffusion 9-9 days .
The diffusate was estimated in the same manner as the preceding salt .
2#136 per cent. of anhydrous hyposulphite of soda , density 1-01778 , diffused at 590.9 , in eight cells , gave 13*11 , 12'77 , 12-92 , 1199 grs. ; mean 12`70 grs. for two cells ; calculated for 2 per cent. , 11'89 grs. of hyposulphite of soda in two cells .
The comparative diffusion of the salts of potash and soda appears thus : Hyposulphite of potash in 8-083 days at 590 ?
8 ... 12*37 100 Hyposulphite of soda in 9'9 days at 599 ... 11.89 96'21 The relation of the sulphate and hyposulphite of soda appears still closer .

The diffusate was evaporated to dryness and ignited with sulphuric acid .
1-966 per cent. of sulphovinate of potash , of density 1*00977 , diffused at 590.8 , in eight cells , gave 12 57 , 12-48 , 12-12 and 12 39 grs. ; mean 12*39 grs. for two cells ; calculated for 2 per cent. , 12-60 grs. of sulphovinate of potash in two cells .
The diffusion of this salt appears in excess when compared with sulphate of potash .

06 , in eight cells , gave 13#32 , 13,50 , 13'78 and 13 15 grs. ; mean 13*44 grs. for two cells ; calculated for 2 per cent. , 13*03 grs. of sulphovinate of soda in two cells .
Comparing the two sulphovinates together , we haveSulphovinate of potash in 8'083 days at 59 ?

'6 ... .
1303 103'41 Neither of these sulphovinates appeared to suffer decomposition in the act of diffusion , at least to any considerable extent .
But the experiments on both of these salts are less precise than usual , from the difficulty of obtaining them entirely free from sulphates .

It was found impossible to form a2 per cent. solution of this salt from its sparing solubility , so that the observations respecting it are limited to the lowest proportion of salt .

10'65 97'18 The tartrate of soda happens to correspond absolutely with the carbonate of soda , the diffusate of the latter salt obtained at the same temperature being also 10'65 grs. ( p. 486 ) .
The double Tartrate of Potash and Soda afforded an interesting instance of deconmposition produced by diffusion .
Instead of the usual diffusion cells , a single plain cylindrical jar was employed about 5 inches in diameter and 10 inches in height .
A portion of a4 per cent. solution of Rochelle salt , amounting to 5000 grs. of liquid , was covered over by nine times as much pure water , in this jar , and the salt allowed to diffuse upwards for three weeks at 56 ? .
The upper third of the fluid column , amounting to 17,000 grs. of liquid , was then drawn off , evaporated to dryness , and the salt ignited and converted , by the addition of hydrochloric acid , into chloride , which weighed 3-14 grs. The salt proved to be a mixture of the two chlorides in the proportion of 2'43 grs. of chloride of potassium and 0 71 gr. of chloride of sodium .
This gives the following as the composition of the diffusate : Tartrate of potash ... 368 Tartrate of soda ... 1 17 4*85 It hence follows that the proportion of potash , or of tartrate of potash , in the diffusate is nearly three times greater than existed in the original Rochelle salt .
It will be recollected that the salt decomposed is , strictly speaking , a bibasic tartrate of potash and soda , and not a double tartrate of potash and soda .
The diffusate was observed to be exactly neutral to test-paper .
This mode of diffusing upwards in water from the lower part of a deep jar obviously gives the greatest degree of separation attainable in consequence of unequal diffusibility .
I may confine myself at present to the conclusion that of the nine pairs of potash and soda salts , of which the diffusion is compared in this paper , the potash salt uniformly exceeds in diffusibility the corresponding soda salt ; that the ratio between the two classes is always sensibly the same , or exhibits only a small range of variation at the temperature of the experiments , which was near 600 ; with the peculiar exception of the hydrates of potash and soda , 494
