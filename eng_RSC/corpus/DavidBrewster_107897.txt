IN a paper on the Polarization of Light by Reflexion , published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1815 , I showed that the Law of the Tangents was rigorously true for the second surfaces of transparent bodies , provided that the sine of the angle of incidence was less than the reciprocal of the index of refraction .
The action of the second surfaces of plates at angles of incidence different from the maximum polarizing angle , was studied by M. ARAGO , who conducted his experiments in the following manner .
" With respect to this phenomenon , " says M. ARAGO , " a remarkable result of experiment may here be noticed ; that is , that in every possible inclination A= A ' .
" Let us suppose that a plate of glass ED Fig ( Fig. 1 .
) is placed in the position that the figure E represents before a medium AB of a uniform tint ; ?O / 0 for instance , a sheet of fine white paper .
The eye placed at 0 , will receive simultaneously the ray I0 reflected at I , and the ray BIO transmitted D at the same point .
Place at mn an opaque diaA B phragm blackened , and perforated by a small hole at S. Lastly , let the eye be furnished with a doubly refracting crystal C , which affords two images of the aperture .
" If now , by means of a little black screen placed between B and I , we stop the ray BI which would have been transmitted , the crystal properly placed will give an ordinary image =A+4 B , and an extraordinary image *A is the light polarized by reflexion , and A ' that polarized by refraction .
= i B. But if the screen were placed between A and I , and the ray AI were intercepted , we should still have two images of the hole , and their intensities would be l B ' and A ' + B ' respectively .
Consequently , without any screen , if the whole of the reflected light AI 0 , and the transmitted BI0 are allowed to arrive at the eye , we shall have for the ordinary image A+ B+ B ' , and for the extraordinary image B +A ' +2 B ' .
Now it appears from actually making the experiment , that the two images are perfectly equal , whatever may be the angle formed by the ray AI with the plate of glass which can only be because A is always equal to A ' .
Consequently The quantity of polarized light contained in the pencil transmitted by a transparent plate is exactly equal , to the quantity of light polarized at right angles , which is found in the pencil reflected by the same plate .
" We have no doubt that M. ARAGO obtained these results , particularly near the polarizing angle , at which limit they are rigorously true ; but at all other angles of incidence they are wholly incorrect .
When we consider , indeed , the nature of the experiment which has been lauded for its elegance and ingenuity , we shall see reason to pronounce its results as nothing more than coarse estimates , in which the apparent equality of the two images is the effect either of imperfect observation or of some unrecognized compensation .
If we make the experiment in the manner Fig. 2 shown in Fig. 2 .
with a colourless and well annealed prism of glass OF D , in place of 0a plate of glass ; and make the ray BI enter the surface FD perpendicularly at I , we get rid of all sources of error , and we obtain , what is really wanted , the result for a single surface .
In this case the experiment is not disturbed by the light reflected from the inner surfaces of the prism , which is all thrown off from the pencil l/ which enters the eye .
AB In M. ARAGo 's form of the experiment , part of the ray BI ( Fig. 1 .
) undergoes reflexions within the plate , and there comes along with it to the eye , at O , a portion of light polarized in the plane of reflexion : in like manner the part of the pencil AI that enters the plate , undergoes partial reflexions , and the part reflected from the first surface carries along with it another portion of light polarized in the plane of reflexion , so that four portions of light polarized in the plane of reflexion reach the eye , while only two portions reach it polarized at right angles to the plane of reflexion , viz. those which are polarized by the refraction of each of the surfaces of the plate .
Now the part of the pencil AI which suffers a first reflexion from each of the surfaces of the plate , is , as we shall presently show , defective in polarized light compared with that which has experienced two refractions , so that it requires the above additional quantities to produce a compensation with the transmitted pencil B 0O .
If this is not the true cause of the apparent compensation , that is , if M. ARAGO took means to exclude the reflected pencils which seem to have produced the compensation , we must then ascribe the equality of the two images to inaccuracy of observation .
But even if we admit that M. ARAGO'S experimental results are correct with regard to plates , it necessarily follows that they cannot be true with regard to surfaces ; for it is obvious from the slightest consideration of the subject , that the phenomenon of the one can never be interchangeable with those of the other .
In order to demonstrate these views by an analysis of the changes which the intromitted light experiences from the two refractions and the intermediate reflexion of a transparent plate , I took a plate of glass of the shape MN ( Fig. 3 .
) having an oblique face Md Fig. 8 .
cut upon one of its ends .
Fig A ray of light R A , polarized + 45 ?
and 45 ?
, was made to fall upon it at A , N at an angle of incidence of -nearly 83 ?
, so that the incliM -Q nation of the planes of polarization of the reflected ray AP was about 36- ? .
Now the ray AC after reflexion in the direction C S , without any refraction at B , where it emerges perpendicularly to Md would also have had the inclination of its planes of polarization equal to 36- ?
if there had been no intermediate refraction at A ; but this refraction alone being u2 147 capable of producing an inclination of 53 ?
or a rotation of 53 ? ?
450 == 8 ?
, and this rotation being in an opposite direction from that produced by the second reflexion at C , the inclination of the planes of polarization for the ray CS is nearly 44- ?
, the reflexion at C having brought back the ray AC almost exactly into the state of natural light .
Without changing either the light or the angle , I cemented a prism M cd on the face M d , so that cd was parallel to d N , and I found that the second refraction at b , equal to that at A , changed the inclination of the planes of polarization to 530 ; that is , the two refractive actions at A and b had overcome the action of reflexion at C , and the pencil bs actually contained light polarized perpendicular to the plane of reflexion .
In order to put this result to another test , I took a plate McNQ ( Fig. 3 .
) of the same glass , which separated the pencil bs reflected at the second surface , from the parallel pencil AP reflected from the first surface , and I found that at an angle of 83 ?
, the value of the inclination I or p for the ray was about 37- ?
, while the value of I for the ray bs was nearly 55 ?
, an effect almost equal to the refractive action of a plate at 83 ?
of incidence .
When the pencil RA is incident on the first surface at the polarizing angle or 56 ? ?
45 ' , the rotation produced by refraction at A is about 2 ?
, or the inclination I= 45 ?
+ 2 ?
= 47 ?
; but the maximum action of the polarizing force at C is sufficient to make I= 0 ?
whether x is 45 ?
or 47 ? .
Hence CB is completely polarized in the plane of reflexion , and the refractive action at b is incapable of changing the plane of polarization when I= 0 ?
: the reason is therefore obvious why the two rotations at A and b , of 2 ?
each , produce no effect at the maximum polarizing angle .
If we now call p= Inclination to the plane of reflexion produced by the 1st refraction at A , ==_ Inclination produced by the reflexion at C , p " = Inclination produced by the 2nd refraction at b , We shall have Cot p= cos ( ii ' ) ; or tan =cs(i i ' ) cos ( i v ) cos(i + Ci ) cos ( + i ' ) Tan = ' = tan x\-os ( i-il ) ( cos(i- ) ) ( cos ( i-i ' ) )3 Cot ' " cot x ( cos ( i ii ' ) ) os(i ' ) These formulae are suited to common light where x= 45 , but when x varies they become Cot p= cot x ( cos ( ii ' ) ) Tan P= tan x ( ( os( ?
/ ) Cot p " = ( cots ( ( Cos( ) ) Resuming the formula for common light , viz. cot p"(os(iit is cos(i+i ' ) ' it 1s obvious that when ( cos ( i i ' ) )3 = cos ( i + i ' ) , cot = -1 , and " = 450 ; that is , the light is restored to common light .
In glass where m= 1.525 this effect takes place at 78 ? ?
7 ' ; a little below 78 ?
in diamond ; and a little above 80 ?
in water .
At an angle below this , p becomes less than 450 , and the pencil contains light polarized in the plane of reflexion ; while at all greater angles 'p is above 450 , and the pencil contains light polarized perpendicular to the plane of reflexion .
Hence we obtain the following curious law .
" A pencil of light reflected from the second surfaces of transparent plates , and reaching the eye after two refractions and an intermediate reflexion , contains at all angles of incidence from 0 ?
to the maximum polarizing angle , a portion of light polarized in the plane of reflexion .
Above the polarizing angle the part of the pencil polarized in the plane of reflexion diminishes till cos ( i + i ' ) = ( cos ( i i'))3 , when it disappears , and the whole pencil has the character of common light .
Above this last angle the pencil contains a quantity of light polarized perpendicularly to the plane of reflexion , which increases to a maximum and then diminishes to zero at 900 .
" Let us now examine the state of the pencil C S ' that has suffered only one refraction and one reflexion .
Resuming the formula tan p ' =cos ( +i ) it ( Cos ( ii'))2 , it is evident that when ( cos ( i -i ' ) )2 = cos ( i + i ' ) , p= 450 , and consequently the light is restored to common light .
This takes place in glass at an angle 149 of 82 ? ?
44 ' .
At all angles beneath this the pencil contains light polarized in the plane of reflexion ; but at all angles above it , the pencil contains light polarized perpendicular to the plane of reflexion , the quantity increasing from 82 ? ?
44 ' to its maximum , and returning to its minimum at 90 ? .
By comparing these deductions with the formula and table for reflected light given in my paper On the Laws of the Polarization of Light by Refraction , the following approximate law will be observed .
When Cos ( i i ' ) = cos ( i + i ' ) All the incident light is reflected .
( Cos ( i i ) )2 = cos ( i + i ' ) Half the incident light is reflected .
( Cos ( i i ' ) )3 cos ( i + i ' ) A third of the incident light is reflected .
( Cos ( i it ) )= cos ( i + i ' ) An nth part of the incident light nearly is reflected .
This law deviates from the truth by a regular progression as n increases , and always gives the value of the reflected light in defect .

20 ... ... 50 Let us now apply the results of the preceding analysis to M. ARAGO'S experiment shown in Fig. 1 .
Suppose the angle of incidence to be 78 ? ?
7 ' , and let the light polarized byreflexion at A ( Fig. 3 .
) be=m , and that polarized by one refraction also = m. Then since the pencil bs is common light , the polarized light in the whole reflected pencil AP , bs is = m , whereas the light polarized by the two refractions is = 2m ; so that M. ARAGO'S experiment makes two quantities appear equal when the one is double that of the other .
If the angle exceeds 780 7r , the oppositely polarized light in the pencil bs will neutralize a portion of the polarized light in the pencil AP , and the ratio of the oppositely polarized rays which seem to be compensated in the experiment , may be that of 3m or even 4m to 1 .
Having thus determined the changes which light undergoes by reflexion from plates , it is easy to obtain formulae for computing the exact quantities of polarized light at any angle of incidence , either in the pencil CBS or bs .
The primitive ray RA being common light , AC will not be in that state , but will have its planes of polarization turned round a quantity x by the refraction at A. ; so that cot x= cos ( i i ' ) .
Hence we must adopt for the measure of the light reflected at C the formula of FRESNEL for polarized light whose plane of incidence forms an angle x with the plane of reflexion .
The intensity of AC being known from the formula for common light , we shall call it unity , then the intensity I of the two pencils polarized x and +x to the plane of reflexion will be sin ( i i ) +tan2 sin2x and sin2 ( i i ' ) tan2 ( i + il ) I --ii c ?
s x a(sin2 ando cos(i + si)\ 2+ 1-2[os(i+Co )2 In like manner if we call the intensity of CB = 1 , we shall have cos ( i + i ' ) Tan x ( cos ( i -i))2 and the intensity I of the transmitted pencil bs sin " ( i il ) tan2 ( i i ' ) 1 sin2 ( i i ' ) cos tan ( i-it)sin and ( cos ( / i ' )Q=(I 1-2(A08 ' +( ) cos ( i + il ) I shall now conclude this paper with the following Table computed from the formule in pages 148 , 149 , and showing the state of the planes of polarization of the three rays AC , CS , and bs .
