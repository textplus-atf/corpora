In all these experiments the value of x was 450 ; but in order to determine the law of variation for 9 , when x varies from 0 ?
to 900 , I took a crystal of quartz with a fine natural surface parallel to its axis ; and I found that at any angle of incidence of f750 and when x was 450 , the inclination of the plane of polarization to the plane of reflexion was 260 20 ' .

The third column is computed by the formula tan p= ( tan 26§ 27 ' ) tan r. From these experiments it appears that the formula expresses with great accuracy all the changes in the planes of polarization which are produced by a single reflexion , and we may therefore apply it in our future investigations .
Let us now suppose that a beam of common light composed of two portions A , B , ( Fig. 2 .

pencil E and an ordinary one F ; and the same will take place with D , G being its extraordinary and H its ordinary image .
If we represent the whole of the reflected pencil or C+D by 1 , then C= 2 , D = , E+F= 1 , and G+H= 1 .
But since the planes of polarization of C and D are each inclined p degrees to the principal section of the rhomb , the intensity of the light of the doubly refracted pencils will be as sin2 P : cos2 ; that is , the intensity of E will be sin2 p , and that of F , I cos2 p. Hence it follows that the difference of these pencils , or , sin2 e2 cos2 ~ , will express the quantity of light which has passed from the extraordinary image E into the ordinary one F , that is , the quantity of light apparently polarized in the plane of reflexion M N. But as the same is true of the pencil D , we have 2 ( } sin2 p cos2 p ) or sin2 p cos2 p for the whole of the polarized light in a pencil of common light C+ D. Hence , since sin2 + cos2 p=1 and cos2 ( =1 sin2 p , we have for the whole quantity of polarized light Q=12 sin2p .
cos(/ + i+ ) But Tanp= -tan xCs(i ) cos ( i cos i ' ) sin2 " And as Tan2 p= -os , and sin2 p+ cos 2 , 76 we have the quotient and the sum of the quantities sin2 p and cos2 p , by which we obtain ... 1 ... cos ( i-i ) ) Sinp ~ ( tan cos ( i + i ' ) ' -(ta cos ( i + i ' ) cos(+i ' ) , tan x os(-i ) OS COS-- ' ) That is Q= 1-2 t cos+ i2 1+ ( tanx cos ( i +i ' ) cos ( i - ' ) As the quantity of reflected light is here supposed to be 1 , we may obtain an expression of Q in terms of the incident light by adopting the formula of FRESNEL for the intensity of a reflected ray .
Thus tcos ( i +t)\ { sin2(i it ) tan2 ( i-it ) , \ cos-(i-)\ 2\sin2 ( i + i ) tan ( i + i')}\ 1 -+ ( ci -i ) 2\cos(i i ) ] As tan x=1 in common light , it is omitted in the preceding formula .
This formula may be adapted to partially polarized rays , that is , to light reflected at any angle different from the angle of maximum polarization , provided we can obtain an expression for the quantity of reflected light .
M. FRESNEL'S general formula has been adapted to this species of rays , by considering themconsionsisting of a quantity a of light completely polarized in a plane making the angle x with that of incidence , and of another quantity I -a in the state of natural light .
Upon this principle it becomes sin ( i i ) 1+a cos " x tan2 ( i i1 ) 1a cos2 = sin2(i + i ' ) .
2 ' tan2 ( i-i ' ) 2 But as we have proved that partially polarized rays are rays whose planes of polarization form an angle of 2x with one another as already explained , x being greater or less than 45 ?
, we obtain a simpler expression for the intensity of the reflected pencil , viz. the very same as that for polarized light .

At all the limits where the pencil is either wholly polarized or not polarized at all , it of course corresponds with experiment : but though in so far as I know there have been no absolute measures taken of the quantity of polarized light at different incidences , yet we are fortunately in possession of a set of experiments by M. ARAGO , who has ascertained the angles above and below the polarizing angle at which glass and water polarize the same proportion of light .
In no case has he measured the absoluite quantity of the polarized rays ; but the comparison of the values of Q at those angles at which he found them in equal proportions , will afford a test of the accuracy of the formula .
This comparison is shown in the following table , in which col .

Part of the whole Light .
I TT5 381 M. ARAGO has concluded , from the experiments above stated , that equal proportions of light are polarized at equal angular distances from the angle of GLASS : WATER : complete polarization .
Thus in Glass No. 1 .
the mean of 82§ 48 ' and 24§ 18 ' is 53§ 33 ' , which does not differ widely from the maximum polarizing angle , or 55 ?
, which M. ARAGO considers as the maximum polarizing angle of the glass * .
In order to compare this principle with the formula , I found that in Water No. 4 .
the angle which polarizes almost exactly the same proportion of light as the angle of 86§ 31 ' , is 15§ 10 ' , the value of p being 41§ 54 ' at both these angles ; but the mean of these is 50§ 50 ' in place of 53§ 11 ' ; so that the rule of M. ARAGO cannot be regarded as correct , and cannot therefore be employed , as he proposes , to determine the angle of complete polarization t. The application of the law of intensity to the phenomena of the polarization of light by successive reflexions , forms a most interesting subject of research .
No person , so far as I know , has made a single experiment upon this point , and those which I have recorded in the Philosophical Transactions for 1815 , have , I believe , never been repeated .
All my fellow labourers , indeed , have overlooked them as insignificant , and have even pronounced the results which flow from them to be chimerical and unfounded .
Those immutable truths , however , which rest on experiment , must ultimately have their triumph ; and it is with no slight satisfaction , that , after fifteen years of unremitted labour , I am enabled not only to demonstrate the correctness of my former experiments , but to present them as the necessary and calculable results of a general law .
When a pencil of common light has been reflected from a transparent surface , at an angle of 61§ 3 ' for example , it has experienced such a physical change , that its planes of polarization form an angle of 6§ 45 ' each with the plane of reflexion .
When it is incident on another similar surface at the same angle , it is no longer common light in which x= 45 ?
, but it is partially polarized light in which x=6§ 45 ' .
In computing therefore the effect of the second reflexion , we must take the general formula tan = tan x ( cos ( i ) ) but , as the value of x is always in the same ratio to the value of p , however great be the number of reflexions , we have tan 0= tan " p for the inclination 0 to the plane of reflexion produced by any number of reflexions n , p being the inclination for one reflexion .
Hence when 0 is given by observation , we have tan p=. .
The formula for any number n of reflexions is there(cos ( i + i')\n fore tan 0= / C ( i +i ) It is evident that 0 never can become equal to 0 ?
; that is , that the pencil cannot be so completely polarized by any number of reflexions at angles different from the polarizing angle , as it is by a single reflexion at the polarizing angle ; but we shall see that the polarization is sensibly complete in consequence of the near approximation of d to 0 ? .
I found , for example , that light was polarized by two reflexions from glass at an angle of 61§ 3 ' , and 60§ 28 ' by another observation .
Now in these cases we have 6 after 6 after Quantity of 1st Reflexion .

In like manner if a , b , c , d , e , &amp;c. are the values of p or 0 for each reflexion , or rather for each angle of incidence , we shall have the final angle or tan 0= tan aX tan bX tan cX tan d , &amp;c. It is scarcely necessary to inform the reader that when a pencil of light reflected at 58§ 2 ' is said to be polarized by another reflexion at 67§ 2 ' , it only means , that this is the angle at which complete polarization takes place in diminishing the angle gradually from 90 ?
to 67§ 2 ' , and that even this angle of 67§ 2 ' will vary with the intensity of the original pencil , with the opening of the pupil , and with the sensibility of the retina .
But when it shall be determined experimentally at what value of p , or rather at what value of Q , the light entirely disappears from the extraordinary image , we shall be able by inverting the formula to ascertain the exact number of reflexions by which a given pencil of light shall be wholly polarized .
As the value of Q depends on the relation of i and i ' , that is , on the index of refraction , and as this index varies for the different colours of the spectrum , it is obvious that Q will have different values for these different colours .
The consequence of this must be , that in bodies of high dispersive powers , the unpolarized light which remains in the extraordinary image , and also the light which forms the ordinary image , must be coloured at all incidences ; the colours being most distinct near the maximum polarizing angle .
This necessary result of the formula , I found to be experimentally true in oil of cassia , and various highly dispersive bodies .
In realgar for example p is =0 at an angle of 69 ?
0 ' for blue light , at 68§ 37 ' for green light , and at 66§ 49 ' for red light .
Hence there can be no angle of complete polarization for white light , which I also found to be the case by experiment ; and as Q must at different angles of incidence have different values for the different rays , the unpolarized light must be composed of a certain portion of each different colour , which may be easily determined by the formula .
82 Such are the laws which regulate the polarization of light by reflexion from the first surfaces of bodies that are not metallic .
The very same laws are applicable to their second surfaces , provided that the incident light has not suffered previous or subsequent refraction from the first surface .
The sine of the angle at which p or Q has a certain value by reflexion from the second surface , is to the sine of the angle at which they have the same value at the first surface , as unity is to the index of refraction .
Hence p and Q may be determined by the preceding formulae after any number of reflexions , even if some of the reflexions are made from the first surface of one body and the second surface of another .
When the second surface is that of a plate with parallel or inclined faces , its action upon light presents curious phenomena , the law of which I have determined .
I refer of course to the action of the second surface at angles less than that which produces total reflexion .
This action has hitherto remained uninvestigated .
It has been hastily inferred , however , from imperfect data ; and the erroneous inference forms the basis of some optical laws , which are considered to be fully established .
Among the various results of the preceding investigation , there is one which seems to possess some theoretical importance .
If we consider polarized rays as those whose planes of polarization are parallel , then it follows that light cannot be brought into such a state by any number of reflexions , or at any angle of incidence , excepting at the angle of complete polarization .
At all other angles the light which seems to be polarized , by disappearing from the extraordinary image of the analysing rhomb , is distinguished from really polarized light , by the property of its planes of polarization forming an angle with each other and with the plane of reflexion .
At the polarizing angle , for example , of 560 45 ' in glass , the light reflected is 79.5 rays , and it is completely polarized , because the planes of polarization of all the rays are parallel ; but at an angle of incidence of 80 ?
, where 392 rays are reflected , no fewer than 157 appear to be polarized , though their planes of polarization are inclined 66§ 26 ' to each other , or 33§ 13 ' to the plane of reflexion .
This appearance of polarization , when the rays have only suffered a displacement in their planes of polarization from an angle of 90 ?
, which approximates them to the state of polarized light , arises from the law which regulates the repartition of polarized light between the ordinary and extraordinary images produced by double re2 83 fraction , and shows that the analysing crystal is not sufficient to distinguish light completely polarized from light in a state of approach to polarization .
The difference , however , between these two kinds of light is marked by most distinctive characters , and will be found to show itself in some of the more complex phenomena of interference .
In my paper of 1815 , already referred to , I was led by a distant view of the phenomena which I have now developed , to consider common light as composed of rays in every state of positive and negative polarization* ; and upon this principle the whole of the phenomena described in this paper may be calculated with the same exactness as upon the supposition of two oppositely polarized pencils .
Nothing indeed can be simpler than such a principle .
The particles of light have planes , which are acted upon by the attractive and repulsive forces residing in solid bodies ; and as these planes must have every possible inclination to a plane passing through the direction of their motion , one half of them will be inclined to this plane , and the other half + .
When light in such a state falls upon a reflecting surface , the and the + particles have each their planes of polarization brought more or less into a state of parallelism with the plane of reflexion , in consequence of the action of the repulsive force upon one side or pole of the particle through which the plane passes ; while in the particles which suffer refraction , the same sides or poles are by the action of the attractive force drawn downwards , so as to increase the inclination of their planes relative to the plane of incidence , and bring them more or less into a state of parallelism with a plane perpendicular to that of refraction .
The formulae already given , and those for refracted light which are contained in another paper , represent the laws according to which the repulsive and attractive forces change the position of the planes of polarization ; and as we have proved that the polarization is the necessary consequence of these planes being brought into certain positions , we may regard all the various phenomena of the polarization of light by reflexion and refraction , as brought under the dominion of laws as well determined as those which regulate the motions of the planets .

On the law of the partial polarization of light by reflexion .
By DAVID BREWSTER , LL. D. F.R.S. L. Sy E. Read February 4 , 1830 .
IN the year 1815 I communicated to the Royal Society a series of experiments on the polarization of light by successive reflexions , which contain the germ of the investigations , the results of which I now propose to explain .
From these experiments it appeared that a given pencil of light could be wholly polarized at any angle of incidence , provided it underwent a sufficient number of reflexions , either at angles wholly above or wholly below the maximum polarizing angle , or at angles partly above and partly below that angle ; and it was scarcely possible to resist the conclusion , that the light not polarized by the first reflexion had suffered a physical change at each action of the reflecting force which brought it nearer and nearer to the state of complete polarization .
This opinion , however , which I have always regarded as demonstrable , appeared in a different light to others .
Guided probably by an experimental result , apparently though not really hostile to it , Dr. YOUNG and MM .
BIOT , ARAGO , and FRESNEL , have adhered to the original opinion of MALUS , that the reflected and refracted pencils consist partly of light wholly polarized , and partly of light in its natural state ; and more recently Mr. HERSCHEL has given the weight of his opinion to the same view of the subject .
Under these circumstances I have often returned to the investigation with renewed zeal ; but though the frequent repetition of my experiments has more and more convinced me of the truth of the conclusions which I drew from them , yet I have not till lately been able to place the subject in a satisfactory aspect , and to connect it with general laws , which give a mathematical form to this fundamental branch of the science of polarization .
If we consider a pencil of natural light as divided into two pencils polarized in rectangular planes by the action of a doubly refracting crystal , and conceive the light of these two pencils to return back through the crystal , it will obviously emerge in the state of natural light .
When we examine the pencil thus recomposed , or when we examine a pencil consisting of two oppositely polarized pencils superposed , we shall find that they comport themselves under every analysis exactly like common light ; so that we are entitled to assume such a pencil as the representative of natural light , and to consider every thing that can be established respecting the one , as true respecting the other .
In applying this principle to the analysis of the phenomena produced by reflexion , I placed the planes of polarization of the compound beam in the plane of reflexion ; but though this led to some interesting conclusions , it did not develope any general law .
I then conceived the idea of making the plane of reflexion bisect the right angle formed by the planes of polarization ; and in this way I observed a series of symmetrical effects at different angles of incidence , which threw a broad light over the whole subject .
In order to explain these results , let AB Fig. 1 .
( Fig , 1 .
) represent the two pencils of oppositely polarized light as separated by double\ / refraction ; let ab , cd be the directions of ... ... , their planes of polarization , forming a right angle aec , and let the plane of reflexion MN , 4 of a surface of plate glass , bisect the angle 0 ... . .

and45 ?
with the plane M N. Let 2/ .- ... ... a rhomb of calcareous spar have its prin6 d cipal section now placed in the plane of re , , .
flexion .
At an incidence of 90 ?
, reckoned from the perpendicular , the reflected images of A and B suffer no change , the angle aec is still a right angle , and the four pencils formed by the calcareous spar are all of equal intensity .
As the incidence however diminishes , the angle aec diminishes also , and the ordinary and extraordinary images of A and B differ in intensity .
At an incidence of 80 ?
for example , the angle aec is reduced from 900 to 66 ?
; at 70 ?
it has been reduced to 400 , and at 56§ 45 ' , the maximum polarizing angle , it has been reduced to 0 ?
; that is , the planes of polarization a b , cd are now parallel .
Below the polarizing angle , at 50 ?
, the axes are again inclined to each other , and form an angle of 220 ?
At 40 ?
they form an angle of 50 ?
, and at 00 , or a perpendicular incidence , they are again brought back to their primitive inclination of 90 ? .
Taking MN to represent the quadrant of incidence from 90 ?
at M , to 0 ?
at N , the curves , 90 ?
, 0 ?
, show the progressive change which takes place in the planes of polarization , the plane of polarization being a tangent to the curve at the incidence which corresponds to any particular point of it.:When we employ a surface of diamond in place of glass ; the inclination of the axes a b , cd is reduced to 46 ?
at an incidence of 80 ?
, to 8 ?
at an incidence of 70 ?
, and at 67§ 43 ' the axes become parallel .
Such being the action of the reflecting forces upon A and B taken separately , let us now consider them as superposed and forming natural light .
At 90 ?
and 0 ?
of incidence , the reflecting force produces no change in the inclination of their axes or planes of polarization ; but at 56§ 45 ' in the case of glass , and 67§ 43 ' in the case of diamond , the axes of all the particles are brought into a state of parallelism with the plane of reflexion ; and consequently when the image which they form is viewed by the rhomb of calcareous spar , they will all pass into the ordinary image , and thus prove that they are wholly polarized in the plane of reflexion .
All this is entirely conformable to what has been long known : but we now see that the total polarization of the reflected pencil at an angle whose tangent is the index of refraction , is effected by turning round the planes of polarization of one half of the light from right to left , and of the other half from left to right , each through an angle of 45 ? .
Let us now see what takes place at those angles where the pencil is only partially polarized .
At 80 ?
for example , the angle of the planes a b , cd is 66 ?
, that is , each plane of polarization has been turned round in opposite directions from an inclination of 45 ?
to one of 33 ?
with the plane of reflexion .
The light has therefore suffered a physical change of a very marked kind , constituting now neither natural nor polarized light .
It is not natural light , because its planes of polarization are not rectangular ; it is not polarized light , because they are not parallel .
It is a pencil of light having the physical character of one half of its rays being polarized at an angle of 66 ?
to the other half .
It will now be asked , how a pencil thus characterized can exhibit the properties of a partially polarized pencil , that is , of a pencil part of whose light is polarized in the plane of reflexion , while the rest retains its condition of natural light .
This will be understood by replacing the analysing rhomb with its principal section in the plane of reflexion , and viewing through it the images A and B at 80 ?
of incidence .
As the axis of A is inclined 33 ?
to MN or the section of the rhomb , the ordinary image of it will be much brighter 71 than the extraordinary image , the intensity of each being in the ratio of cos2 to sin 2 &lt; , p being the angle of inclination , or 33 ?
in the present case .
In like manner the ordinary image of B will be in the same ratio brighter than its extraordinary image , that is , by considering A and B in a state of superposition , the extraordinary image of a pencil of light reflected at 80 ?
will be fainter than the ordinary image in the ratio of sin 2 33 ?
to cos 2 33 ? .
But this inequality in the intensity of the two pencils is precisely what would be produced by a corpound pencil , part of which is polarized in the plane of reflexion , and part of which is common light .
When MALUS , therefore , and his successors analysed the pencil reflected at 80 ?
, they could not do otherwise than conclude that it was partially polarized , consisting partly of light polarized in the plane of reflexion , and partly of natural light .
The action of successive reflexions , however , afforded a more precise means of analysis , in so far as it proved that the portion of what was deemed natural light had in reality suffered a physical change , which approximated it to the state of polarized light ; and we now see that the portion of what was called polarized light was only what may be called apparently polarized ; for though it disappears , like polarized light , from the extraordinary imnage of the analysing prism , yet there is not a single particle of it polarized in the plane of reflexion .
These results must be admitted to possess considerable interest in themselves ; but , as we shall proceed to show , they lead to conclusions of general importance .
The quantity of light which disappears from the extraordinary image , is obviously the quantity of light which is really or apparently polarized at the given angle of incidence ; and if we admit the truth of the law of repartition discovered by MALUS , and represented by Poo = Po cos2 p , and Poe =Po sin 2 , and if we can determine p for substances of every refractive power , and for all angles of incidence , we may consider as established the mathematical law which determines the intensity of the polarized pencil , whatever be the nature of the body which reflects it , -whatever be the angle at which it is incident , -whatever be the number of reflexions which it suffers , and whether these reflexions are all made from one substance , or partly from one substance and partly from another .
The first step in this investigation is to determine the law according to which a reflecting surface changes the plane of polarization of a polarized ray .
This 72 subject was first examined by MALUS , but not with that success which attended most of his labours .
Before I was acquainted with what had been done by M. FRESNEL , or with the experiments of M. ARAGO on glass and water , I had made a number of very careful experiments on the same subject , and had represented them by formulae founded on the law of the tangents .
These formulae , however , I found to be defective ; and I am persuaded , from a very extensive series of experiments , that the formulae of FRESNEL are accurate expressions of the phenomena under every variation of incidence and refractive power .
If i is the angle of incidence , i ' the angle of refraction , x the primitive inclination of the plane of the polarized ray to the plane of reflexion , and p the inclination to which that plane is brought by reflexion , then , according to FRESNEL , we have cos ( i + i ' ) Tan p= tan x cs( + cos ( i i ' ) When x is 45 ?
, as in the preceding observations , then tan x= 1 , and we have cos ( i + i ' ) Tan Coo In these formulae , which'are founded on the law of the tangents , i+ i ' is the supplement of the angle which the reflected ray forms with the refracted ray ; while i i ' is the angle which the incident ray forms with the refracted ray , or the deviation produced by refraction .
These formulae have been verified by M. ARAGO at ten angles of incidence upon Glass , and four upon Water ; but his experiments were made only in the case where x is 45 ?
, and where tan x disappears from the formula .
As my experiments embrace a wider range of substances , and also the general case where x varies from 0 ?
to 90 ?
, I consider them as a necessary basis for a law of such extensive application .
The first series of experiments which I made was upon Plate Glass , in which the maximum polarizing angle was nearly 56 ?
: hence I assume the index of refraction to be 1.4826 .
The following were the results : Angle of Angle of Incidence .
