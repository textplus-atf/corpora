FERMAT'S theorem of the polygonal numbers has engaged the attention of some of the most eminent mathematicians .
It was first announced ( about the year 1670 ) in his edition of Diophantus , published after his death ( it occurs in a note on the 31st question , p. 180 ) .
It is to be found stated at length in LEGENDRE'S 'Theorie des Nombres ' ( ill p. 187 of the 2nd edition , &amp;c. ) .
For above a century after it appeared , no proof was discovered of any part of it ; but in 1770LAGRAENGE ( in the Transactions of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Berlin ) gave a proof of the second branch of the theorem ( the case of the square numbers ) , from the paper containing which it may be collected that EULER had endeavoured in vain to establish a proof , but had suggested the clue by which LAGRANGE succeeded in discovering one , In the second volume of EULER'S 'Opuscula Analytica , ' there is an article on this subject , of some length , lamenting the loss of FER nAT'S investigations , and pointing out that LAGRANGE'S proof as to the square numbers affords ( from its nature ) no assistance to the discovery of a proof of the other cases ; he adds , " sine dubio plerique Geometrae in his demonstrationibus investigandis frustra desudaverint .
" About twenty-five years after the death of EULER ( who died in 1783 ) , LEGENDRE , in his ' Theory des Nombres , ' published a proof of the first branch of the theorem ( the case of the triangular numbers ) , which proof is in part inductive , and not founded on pure demonstration ; and subsequently M. CAUTCHY discovered a proof of all the cases ( assuming the first and second cases to be proved ) ; this was published about the year 1816 , in a Supplement to LEGENDRE'S ' Theory des Nombres .
' FERMAT , after stating the proposition , alludes to the proof of it as arising out of " macny various and abstruse mysteries of numbers ; " and he states his intention to " wrinte an entire book on the sztbject , czd very much to advaice the bounds of arithmetic .
" No such work has appeared ; and it is understood that among his papers no trace has been found of any materials for such a publication .
It becomes a matter of more than mere curiosity to consider what could have been the properties of numbers alluded to ; obviously they must have been connected , more or less , with the division of numbers into squares or other polygonal numbers .
The general object I have in view is to investigate the properties of numbers on which FERMAT 's theorem depend .
In this paper I wish to call attention to some properties connected with the division of numbers into 4 squares , which probably ( in some form ) were part of the system to which FERMAT alluded .
I have already stated two properties of the odd numbers ( not , I believe , noticed before ) , upon one of which the whole of FERMAT'S theorem depends ( as will hereafter appear ) .
The first is to be found in the Transactions of the Royal Society for the year 1854 , p. 313 ; it is there called Theorem C. " Every odd number may be divided into square numbers ( not exceeding 4 ) , the algebraic sum of whose roots ( positive or negative ) will ( in some form of the roots ) be equal to every odd number from 1 to the greatest possible sum of the roots .
" Or in a purely algebraic form .
If aa2-tbd -t+ +d2=2n+1 , and a +b +c +d =2r+l , a , b , c , d being integral or nil , n and r being positive , and ra maximum , then if r ' be any positive integer ( not greater than r ) , it will always be possible to satisfy the pair of equations w -x2+-y2+-Z2= 2n+ 1w -x +y +z =2r'+1 , by integral values ( positive , negative , or nil ) of w , x , y , z. " The other is to be found in the Royal Society 's Transactions for 1859 , p. 49 , and relates not to the sum of the roots , but to the difference between two of them .
The first of these connects together the first and second branch of FERMAT'S theorem .
For if every odd number can be divided into 4 square numbers , so that the sum of the roots of two of them being deducted from the sum of the roots of the other two , there shall be a remainder of 1 , Then every number is divisible into 3 triangular numbers ; for the 2 sums of the roots must be of the form 2a+1 , and 2a , and the four roots will be of the form a+p+ , a , a+-p , a-- ; and if 2n+1 equals the sum of these roots squared , 2n+l=4a2+2p2+2q2+2a+2jp+1 , and n=2a2+a +p+p+ 2 ; but 2a2+a is a triangular number , and p2+p+2 is the general form for the sum of any 2 triangular numbers* ; therefore n any number is equal to 3 triangular numbers ( nil being considered as a triangular number , as some of the terms may become equal to nothing ) .
There are some theorems worthy of remark arising out of a comparison of the differences of the roots of the four square numbers into which every odd number may be divided .
It will appear from the Table that accompanies this paper , that when a number of the form 4-n+1 is divisible into 2 square numbers ( of which one must be even and the other odd , 4n+1 being an odd number ) , the roots of these 2 squares furnish the exte* The proof of this is given presently .
I1 rior differences of the roots of the four squares into which 2nn+1 may be divided .
Before explaining the Table , it is proper to state that if an odd number be divisible into 4 square numbers , three of them must be odd , and one of them even , or one of them must be odd , and 3 of them even , otherwise their sum cannot be an odd number ; it follows from this that if the difference between any two of them be an odd number , the difference between the other two must be an even number , and vice versed ; for let a2+b2+c2+d2=2n+1 , then if a2-b2=2p , c2-d2 must equal 2g+1 ; if possible let c2-d2=2r , then a2-b2+c2d2=2p+2r ; add 2b2+2d2 ( an even number ) to each , and a2+b2+c2+d2 will be an even number , which by the hypothesis it is not ; if , therefore , a2b2 be an even number , c2-d2 cannot also be an even number , and therefore must be an odd one .
If , therefore , the fouir roots of the squares into which any odd number may be divided are arranged in any order there will be three differences ; the two exterior differences will be one odd , the other even ; the middle difference may be either odd or even .
The Table is arranged thus : the lowest row of figures is the series 1 , 5 , 9 , 13 , 17 , &amp;c. ( 4n -1 ) ; the next row above is the series of natural numbers , 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , &amp;c. ( n ) , &amp;c. ; the next row is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , &amp;c. ( 2n+1 ) the odd numbers ; each of the odd numbers is the first term in a series increasing upwards by the numbers , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , &amp;c. , forming an arithmetic series of the second order ( the first and second differences being respectively 2 each ) ; when the number in the lowest row cannot be divided into 2 squares , the arithmetic series is not formed , and the square spaces are marked with an asterisk , but when the number 4n+1 is divisible into two square numbers , the roots of these squares constitute the two exterior differences of the roots into which the odd numbers may be divided , and also of the roots into which each term of the series increasing upward may be divided ; the middle difference of the roots will be the smaller half of the sum of the 2 roots of the square numbers into which 4n+1 may be divided , with a negative sign , and will increase by 1 in each successive term of the upward series .
For example , in the Table take the number 29 in the lowest row , 7x 4+1= 29 , 7 is the number above it , and 7X2+1=15 the odd number , which is the first term of the series 15 , 17 , 21 , 27 , 35 , &amp;c. Now 29 is composed of 2 square numbers , 4 and 25 , whose roots are 2 and 5 , 2+5=7 ; the smaller half is 3 , and 2 , -3 , 5 will be the differences of the roots of the squares into which 15 may be divided , and whose sum will equal 1 ; thus 2 , -3 , 5 -1 1 , -2 , 3 ; the roots when squared and added together equal 15 , and the other terms of the series follow in like manner , obeying the law indicated ; thus 5 , -2 , 2 --3 , 2 , 0 , 2 when squared and added .

=21 when squared and added .

=35 The proof of all this depends on a property of numbers mentioned in the Philosophical Transactions for 1854 , vol. cxliv .
p 317 .
If any number be composed of two triangular numbers , it will also equal a square and a double triangular number .
If a2+a b2 -b 22 it will be of the form a2-+a+b2 , and may be assumed equal to a2+a+b " .
For if 2 numbers be both odd or both even , they may always be represented by a+-b and a-b ; if one be odd and the other even , they may always be represented by a+b+1 and a- &amp; , or by a+b and a-b+1 ; and if the two numbers be made the bases of trigonal numbers , the sum of the two trigonal numbers will always be of the form a2+a+b , or a2+cb-b ?
2 : now when any number in the natural series of numbers is composed of two triangular numbers , it may be represented by ac2+a+ b2 , and 4n+1 will then equal 4a2+4a+1+4 b2 , -obviously the sum of an odd and an even square , whose roots are 2b and 2a+1 ; and 2n+1 , the corresponding odd number , will equal 2a2+2a+1+2b2 , -obviously composed of 4 square numbers , whose roots are b , 6 , a , a+1 ; and if they be arranged thus , 2b , -(a+b ) 2a+1 -b , b , -a , a+l , so that the sum of their roots may equal 1 , the exterior differences of the roots will be 2b and 2a+1 , the roots of the two squares into which 4n+1 is divisible ; and the middle difference will be -(a+b ) , the smaller half of the sum of the roots ( 2b+2a+1 ) with a negative sign ; if the exterior differences be reversed and the middle difference be increased by 1 , the differences will be 2a+1 , -(a+b-1 ) , 2b , and the roots whose sum will equal 1 will be , with their differences above them , 2a+l , -(a+b-1 ) , 2b -(a+1 ) , a(b-1 ) , b+1 , and the sum of the squares of the roots will be 2 more ; from these two sets of roots all the rest may be obtained , by adding one to each of two roots and subtracting 1 from each of the other two roots ; the exterior differences of the roots will therefore always be the same , and the middle difference will increase by 1 at each step ; the sum of the squares of the roots will increase by 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , &amp;c. As the sum of any two square numbers of which one is odd and the other even ( 4a2+4a+1+4b2 ) must be of the form 4n+1 , every possible case of an odd square combined with an even square must occur somewhere in the series 1 , 5 , 9 , 13 , &amp;c. , and the Table ( if extended ) must contain every possible case of odd and even numbers as exterior differences , combined with every possible and available middle difference ; for negative differences may be rejected , inasmuch as , if the roots be put according to their algebraic value , all the differences must be positive ; thus the roots and differences of 15 above were 2 , -3 , 5 -1 , 1 , -2 , 3 ; if the roots be placed according to their algebraic value , they would be -2 , -1 , 1 , 3 , and with the differences above 1 , 2 , 2 -2 , -1 , 1 , 3 ; 15 will therefore be found in the column above 5 , and in the fourth place .
The Table ( extended indefinitely ) would therefore contain every possible odd number the sum of whose roots may equal 1 .
In connexion with the Table just mentioned , it may be well to state a theorem respecting the differences of the roots , by which , having obtained one division of an odd number into 4 , or 3 squares ( equal to , or greater than 1 , and not more than 2 of them equal to each other ) , other modes of dividing the odd number into 4 squares may generally be obtained .
Theorem .
If any number be composed of 3 squares , and the roots be arranged in the order of their algebraic value , if the two differences between the adjoining roots differ by 3 , or a multiple of 3 , then by reversing the differences and obtaining roots whose algebraic sum shall equal the sum of the former roots , but whose differences shall be reversed , another form of division into squares will be obtained ; that is , the sum of the squares of the roots thus obtained will be equal to the sum of the squares of the first roots .
Example .
[ Note.-I use the symbol 2 to indicate that the numbers below it are to be considered as roots which are to be squared and added together ; thus , 100=62+82 ; therefore 101=0 , 1 , 6 , 8 .
] 52 The differences of 1 , 6 , 8 are 5 , 2 , which differ by 3 .
If , now , roots be obtained with differences 2 , 5 , and whose sum will equal 1+6+8=15 , the sum of the squares 25 of these roots will equal 101 .
2 , 4 , 9 are roots having the differences reversed , and their sum =15 ; therefore 22+42+ 92=12 +62+82= 101 .
Again , leaving out 6 as a17 root , 65=0 , 1 , 8 ; the differences are 1 , 7 ; the sum of the roots =9 : -2 , 5 , 6 are roots having the same sum but the differences reversed , and the sum of their squares 274 4+25+36=65 ; therefore 65=2 , 5 , 6 .
Again , -5 , 2 , 6 have the differences 7 , 4 ; 47 their sum = 3 ; but -4 , 0 , 7 have the differences reversed and the same sum ; therefore 2274 47 2 -5 , 2 , 6=-4 , 0 , 7=65 , and 101=0 , 4 , 6 , 7 .
The proof of this theorem will appear from putting the general case algebraically , which also will show the method of obtaining the new roots required .
Let the differences of the roots be represented by a , a+ 3n ( which include every case ) ; then ( p ) , dff .
a(p+a ) , " +3pp+2a+ 3n ) will represent any 3 roots having the required differences ; the sum of these roots is 3p+3a+3nU [ a multiple of 3 ] : reverse the differences and take p as the first root , and they will be -- , " +3(p+a+3n ) , p+2a+3n ; the sum will be 3p+3a+ 6n [ also a multiple of 3 ] ; therefore the difference will be a multiple of 3 , and the sums may be made equal ( one to the other ) by adding or subtracting from each root the difference divided by 3 : here the difference is 3n , and the new roots will be p-n , _a+3p+a+2n , ap+2a+2n ; and if each of these sets of roots be squared and added together , the sum of each will be 3p2+5a2+9n2+6ap+6np+12an .
A similar theorem belongs to 4 roots whose differences differ by 4 : thus 1 , 2 , 7 , 16 , as roots , have the differences 1 , 5 , 9 ; their sum is 26 : -3 , 6 , 11 , 12 have the differences reversed , 9 , 5 , 1 ; and their sum also equals 26 ; and 2 2 .
2215991515 13 13 51 1 , 2 , 7 , 16 =-3 , 6 , 11 , 12=310 : so -6 , -5 , 0 , 13 =-12 , 1 , 6 , 7 230 , the sum of the roots in each case being equal , and the differences reversed .
A similar theorem also belongs to 5 roots whose differences differ by 5 , and no doubt to n roots whose differences differ by n. There are many arithmetic series of the 2nd order which , beginning with 1 as a first term , will have all their terms divisible into not exceeding four squares ; there are 3 such series to which I wish to call attention .
If 1 be increased by 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , &amp;c. , the 2 ( n+l)th term of the series is always n2+n+l1 , or 4n2-2n+1 , that is , n , n , n , n+l1 .
2 If 1 be increased by 2 , 6 , 10 , 14 , &amp;c. , the ( n+l)th term will always be 0 , 1 , n , n. 2 If 1 be increased by 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , &amp;c. , the ( n+1)th term will be 0 , 0 , n , n+1 .
The first of these series contains the numbers which , being divided into 4 squares , give the sum of the roots a maximum ; the others give the differences between 2 roots a maximum , the one the even differences , the other the odd differences .
But if any odd number ( instead of 1 ) be made the first term of the series , some remarkable consequences ensue .
If any odd number 4nT1 be increased by 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , &amp;c. , the term whose index of place is the lesser moiety of the odd number will be composed of 4 squares , whose roots will be the result of again dividing the moieties of the odd number ; thus 4nT^12nTl1+2n=nTl+n+n+n ; if the number be 4n-1 , 2 the ( 2n-l1)th'term will be ( 2n-1 ) , n , r , n ; if it be 4n+1 , the 2nth term will be n , n , n , n+l ; but every term will be composed of one or more square numbers + an arithmetic number , and the squares and the arithmetic numbers will each form a regular series .
An example in figures will best explain this : 19=9 +10=4+ 5+5 +5 .
If 19 2 be increased by 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , &amp;c. , the 9th term is 91=4 , 5 , 5 , 5 ; so if 19 be increased by 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , &amp;c. , the successive terms will be composed of squares and arithmetic numbers as below : to distinguish the arithmetic numbers from roots , I enclose them in a 0 .

The numbers are alternately of the form 4n+1 and 4n1 ; the terms of the series are therefore equal to 2 squares +a number of the form 4n+l , and to 2 other squares +a number of the form 4n1 .
A number of the form 4n--1 cannot be composed of less than 3 squares ; for if a2 and b2 be odd squares , their sum is of the form ( 8n+2 ) ; if even squares , of the form ( 4n ) ; if one be odd and the other even , ( 4n+1 ) ; and 4n-1 cannot equal 8n'+2 , or 4n " , or 4n"'+1 ; but as the 2 squares are always equal , the arithmetic number may always be turned into a number of the form 4n+1 , by substituting for the 2 equal squares 2 others , whose roots shall be , the one one more , the other one less ; thus 79-=6 , 6+ =5,7+5=5,7,1 , 2 ; also=5 , 5+(2 =5 , 5 , 52 .
And every term of the series is divisible into 4 squares whenever 4n+1 is divisible into 2 squares , or when 4n'-1 , another form of 4 , is so divisible .
It would follow , that if there be any 2 series in arithmetical progression with a common difference of 1 , and the odd terms of the one be placed over the even terms of the other , then if either series be considered as composed of roots and the other of numbers , and the squares of the roots be added to the numbers , a series will be formed of the first sort ; thus 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , &amp;c. 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , &amp;c. If the lower be considered as roots , the series becomes 45 , 12 57 , ,4 71 , , 87 , 1 , &amp; c ; if the upper be considered as roots , the series is 87 , 16 71 , 1 57 , 12 45 , &amp; c , the same series , but decreasing instead of increasing ; and it is worthy of remark that the first term of the series is the sum of the root and the arithmetic number , viz. 15 .
If both the series decrease , as 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , &amp;c. , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , &amp;c. , and the lower be considered as roots , the series is 45 , 12 33 , o 23 , 15 , whose first term is 3 , the difference between the arithmetic number and the root ; if the upper be considered as roots , the first term is 3 , but negative , and the series would be -3,2-1,4 3,6 9,6 17 , o 27,12 &amp;c. 87,18 69 , ,6 53,14 39 , &amp;c. If the series be composed of 2 equal roots , increasing or decreasing each by 1 , or of 2 roots differing by 1 , and increasing or decreasing in like manner , then if the series of numbers differ by 2 , so that all the terms shall be odd , a series will be formed of the 2nd or 3rd kind , whose second difference will be 4 ; thus if the numbers be 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 , &amp;c. , and the roots 3 , 3 , 4 , 4 , 5 , 5 , 6 , 6 , the series will be 27 , 16 43 , 20 63 , 24 87 , a series of the 3rd kind having a second difference of 4 , and the first term will be the difference between the number and the sum of the roots , viz. 9-(3+ 3 ) ; for 3,4 7 , 8 15 , 12 27 produces the series ; but if the numbers decrease by 2 , 9 , 7 5 , 3 , &amp;c. ( 3 , 3 ) , ( 4 , 4 ) , ( 5 , 5 ) , ( 6 , 6 ) , the series will be 27 , ,2 39 , ,6 55,20 75 , and the first term of that series is the sum of the roots and the odd number , viz. 9+3+3=15 , for 15 , 19 , 27 , 39 , &amp;c. is the series .
So if the roots , instead of being equal , differ by 1 , thus , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , &amp;c. 3 , 4 , 4 , 55 , , 6 , 6 , 7 , &amp;c. , the series will be 31 , 1 49,22 71,26 97 , &amp;c. , a series of the 2nd kind , whose first term is the difference between 6 and 3+4 , viz. 1 , and negative , and the series is --1,2 1,6 7,10 17,14 31 , 8 49,22 71 , &amp;c. ; but if the numbers decrease , as 12 , 10 , 8 , 6 , &amp;c. 3 , 4 , 4 , 5 , 5 , 6 , 6 , 7 , &amp;c. , the series is 37,4 51 , 18 69,22 91 , &amp; c , and the first term is 19=-12+3+4 , 19,2 21 , 6 27 , 1 37 , 14 51 , &amp;c. Some remarkable properties arise from connecting these series together , which I must reserve for a future communication .
