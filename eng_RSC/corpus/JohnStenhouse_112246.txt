" Additional Observations on the Proximate Principles of the Lichens .
" By JOHN STENHOUSE , LL. D. , F.R.S. Re .
ceived October 3 , 1862 .
The Lichens on which I have recently been experimenting are two in number , namely , the South American variety of Roccella tinctoria , which is imported in considerable quantities from the neighbourhood of Lima and Valparaiso , and is known in commerce as " Lima weed ; " and the Roccella tinctoria var .
fucifornis , the same which I had formerly designated Roccella Montagnei ; it is the " Angola weed " of commerce .
Soon after the publication in 1848 of my first paper on this subject , Dr. Schunck* threw out the hypothesis that the various compounds produced by boiling lecanoric , erythric , alphaand beta-orsellic acids with alcohol were all one and the same ether the pseudoerythrin of Ieeren .
No further light was thrown upon this obscure subject till the publication of I-esse 's able paper in the March Number of Liebig 's 'Annalen ' for 1861 .
The Archil-lichen which Professor Iesse investigated was that from Angola .
He extracted its colour-yielding principle-to which , from its feeble acid properties , he restores the name of erythrin originally given it by Heeren-by treating it with milk of lime , and precipitating either with carbonic or hydrochloric acid .
On drying and boiling the erythrin with strong alcohol , he produced the ether which he terms orsellinic ether , the composition and properties of which he found to correspond precisely with those which Schunck and I had previously ascertained .
HIesse 's formula for this ether is C6tTH , ( C4 I , ) 0 , .
By treating it with chlorine and bromine , he succeeded in replacing two equivalents of hydrogen by these elements , producing what he termed the bichloroand bibromo-orsellinic ethers .
I have repeated Hesse 's experiments , so far as the preparation of the bibrominated ether is concerned , and find , as will be seen by the subjoined analyses , that his statements are perfectly correct .
I. 0'7960 grm. substance , dried in vacuo over sulphuric acid , gave in the usual manner 0'8390 grm. Ag Br .
II .
0-6735 grm. gave 0-8400 grm. CO2 and 0'1740 grm. Aq .

54 100-00 I likewise prepared a quantity of the corresponding methylic ether , by boiling erythrin in wood-spirit .
When an alcoholic solution of this ether was treated with excess of bromine , the bibrominated orsellinate of methyl was produced .
It crystallized in colourless flat needles , and furnished on analysis the following results : Dried in vacuo over sulphuric acid , I. 0-3135 grm. substance gave 0'3463 Ag Br .

On treating the ethylcompound obtained from this acid with bromine , a body was formed which in properties and composition was exactly the same with the bibrominated ethyl-compound obtained from erythrin by Hesse , as may be seen by the following analytical details : I. 11890 grm. substance gave 1*2658 grm.

45-30 45-19 The circumstance that the ethers , whether obtained from erythrin or from alpha-orsellic acid , have not only the same properties and percentage composition , but likewise the same atomic weights , affords a very strong confirmation of the correctness of Dr. Schunck 's hypothesis .
Orsellinate of Amyl .
On boiling dried erythrin with amylic alcohol for several hours , and removing the excess of alcohol by distillation , the residue yielded on standing a crystalline mass , which , however , I was unable to free entirely from resinous matter .
Consequently it could not be analysed .
It formed platy crystals of considerable lustre .
There is every reason to believe , therefore , that it was the amyl-compound in question .
The attempt to form a bromine-derivative , which it was expected might be more easily purified , did not furnish satisfactory results , though such a body was apparently produced .
Formation of Erythroglueine .
I have already shown * that when the ethyl-compound of erythrin , then known as erythric ether , is boiled with potash or baryta , alcoholic vapours are given off , while orcin and erythroglucine remain in the solution .
I have recently found that though alpha-orsellic acid , as I had already established , when boiled with alkalies yields orcin but no erythroglucine whatever , yet when the ethyl-compound obtained from it is boiled with lime or any of the alkalies for five or six hours , erythroglucine as well as orcin is produced .
In order to verify this very unexpected result , the erythroglucine , which was obtained with all its characteristic properties , was subjected to analysis .

52-46 122 100-00 As therefore the ether produced from two different sources , namely , from erythrin and alpha-orsellic acid , when boiled with alkalies yields erythroglucine , I think there is every reason to expect that the ethers derived from lecanoric and other lichen acids , when similarly treated , will likewise yield orcin and erythroglucine , thus affording still further confirmation of the correctness of Dr. Schunck 's hypothesis .
It now naturally occurred to me to treat the methylic ether obtained from alpha-orsellic acid with lime , in order either to procure a homologue of erythroglucine , or to attain results which might throw some light on the constitution of erythroglucine itself .
The result of this experiment was somewhat unexpected ; for though several trials were made on a considerable scale , and the boiling with lime was continued , as before , till the ether was entirely decomposed , much orcin but no erythroglucine was produced .
The same negative results were obtained when the methylic ether prepared from erythrin was subjected to a similar treatment .
It appears therefore that ethyl is necessary to the formation of erythroglucine from alphaorsellic acid , and that it cannot be replaced by methyl .
From the very great analogy which erythroglucine bears to ordinary mannite ( being , in fact , the mannite of the lichen series ) , I was induced to submit it to the action of hydriodic acid , in precisely the same way adopted by Wanklyn and Erlenmeyer with mannite .
A considerable quantity of erythroglucine was introduced into a retort and distilled with a great excess of strong hydriodic acid , while a current of carbonic acid gas traversed the hot liquid .
A darkcoloured oil of an ethereal odour , and heavier than water , mingled with abundance of free iodine , passed over into the receiver , while a large quantity of a black humus-like body remained in the retort .
The latter substance was evidently an organic compound containing much iodine ; but as it was insoluble in all the usual solvents , such as 266 water , alcohol , and ether , it was impossible to purify it .
The oil was agitated with metallic mercury , to remove free iodine , then washed with water , dried over chloride of calcium , and redistilled .
The quantity obtained in this manner was extremely small .
The specimen examined was almost colourless , and boiled at 90 ?
C. The residue in the retort contained another oil , boiling , with rapid decomposition , at a much higher temperature .
Analysis furnished the following results:0-3615 grm. substance gave 0-3630 CO2 and 0-1870 Aq , corresponding to 27'39 Carbon and 5 75 Hydrogen per cent. These numbers approximate to those which iodide of propyl or iodide of butyl should furnish ; but owing to the very small quantity of substance at my disposal , I was unable to subject this curious oil to a thorough examination .
Tribrom beta-orcin .
I have ascertained that when bromine is added to an aqueous solution of beta-orcin , a brominated derivative is formed , which crystallizes in needles .
It is but slightly soluble .
in water , very soluble in alcohol and ether .
It is perfectly similar in its properties to tribromorcin , derived from ordinary orcin , and most probably resembles it in constitution .
Unfortunately the small amount of betaorcin in my possession prevented me obtaining the tribrom-beta-orcin in sufficient abundance to submit it to analysis .
In the present state of our knowledge , the following equations will serve to throw light upon the constitution of a few of the more important lichen-derived compounds:(1 ) When alcohol is boiled with erythrin , the following reaction takes place : C56 H 028 + 2C4 , 02 O , =C,2 H6 0 , , + 2C2 , H12 , 08+ 2HO Erythrin .

The picroerythrin is then transformed into erythroglucine , orcin , and carbonic acid , and the orsellinic acid into carbonic acid and orcin:u 2 1862 .
