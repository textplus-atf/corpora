On the Equation for the Product of the Differences of all but one of the Boots of a given Equation .
By ARTHUR CAYLEY , Esq. , F.R.S. Received November 30 , 1860 , -Read January 10 , 1861 .
IT is easy to see that for an equation of the order n , the product of the differences of all but one of the roots will be determined by an equation of the order n , the coefficients of which are alternately rational functions of the coefficients of the original equation , and rational functions multiplied by the square root of the discriminant .
In fact , if the equation be pv=(a , ... tv , l)n=a(v--)(v-f- ) ... , then putting for the moment a=l , and disregarding numerical factors , V/ , the square root of the discriminant , is equal to the product of the differences of the roots , and p ' &amp; is equal to ( a-3)(a-y ) ... , consequently the product of the differences of the roots , all but c , is equal to\/ O C- ' , and the expression 1 is the root of an equation of the order n , the coefficients of which are rational functions of the coefficients of the original equation .
I propose in the present memoir to determine the equation in question for equations of the orders three , four , and five : the process employed is similar to that in my memoir " On the Equation of Differences for an Equation of any Order , and in particular for Equations of the Orders Two , Three , Four , and Five* , " viz. the last coefficient of the given equation is put equal to zero , so that the given equation breaks up into v=0 and into an equation of the order n-1 called the reduced equation ; and this being so , the required equation breaks up into an equation of the order n-i ( which however is not , as for the equation of differences , that which corresponds to the reduced equation ) and into a linear equation ; the equation of the order n-1 is calculated by the method of symmetric functions ; and combning it with the linear equation , which is known , we have the required equation , except as regards the terms involving the last coefficient , which terms are found by the consideration that the coefficients of the required equation are seminvariants .
The solution leads immediately to that of a more general question ; for if the product of the differences of all the roots except a , of the given equation pv=(*X( , 1)n=a(uv-c)(v-3 ) ... =0 ( which product is a function of the degree n2 in regard to each of the roots ( , y , S. .
) , is multiplied by ( x-aMy)n-2 , the function so obtained will be the root of an equation of the order n , the coefficients of which are covariants of the quantic ( *)x( , y ) ) , and these coefficients can be at once obtained by writing , in the place of the seminvariants of the former result , the covariants to which they respectively belong .
In the case of the quintic equation , one of these covariants is , in regard to the coefficients , of the degree 6 , which exceeds the limit of the tabulated covariants , the covariant in question has therefore to be now first calculated .
The covariant equations for the cubic and the quartic might be deduced from the formulae Nos. 119 and 142 of my Fifth memoir on Quantics* ; they are in fact the bases of the methods which are there given for the solution of the cubic and the quartic equations respectively ; and it was in this way that I was led to consider the problem which is here treated of .
1 .
The notation ~ ( a , 3 , y. .
) is used ( after Professor SYLVESTER ) to denote the product of the squared differences of ( a , { , y. .
) , and the notation 4( ( a , y. .
) to denote the product of the differences taken in a determinate order , viz. , p , , Y..)=(M--)(-y)(-~). .
( ~3-yX)( -). .
( y-~). .

The product of the differences of the roots of an equation depends , as already noticed , on the square root of the discriminant ; and in order to fix the numerical factors and signs , it will be convenient , in regard to the equations ( a , b , clv , 1)2=0 , ( a , b , c , dcv , 1)3-0 , ( a , b , c , d , eDv , 1 ) =0 , ( a , b9 c , d , e , fv , 1)5=0 , to write as follows : ?
( o , P ) a/ -(4ac-b2 ) =1 / , 2(o , F , y)= -aV/ -(27ad+4ac3+-. .
) =a -o , ( a0 , p y , )= , --~3/ 256aCe'-27a'd4+ =---~ ( 6 ( 3 , y8 )=c/ 3)125(a4:f4+256a e"+ .
- .
= / , where it is to be observed , for example , that writing in the last equation = 0 , and therefore f=O , we have ( os , , y , , 0))=--e4/ 256a3e3+. .
, which agrees with the equation V(al , 7 , l , 0)= j3y3( , , 6)3y , )= ( a , , 7 , 6 ) , if for V(a , , y , S ) we substitute the value given by the last equation but one .
For the cubic equation ( a , b , c , dvV , 1)3=0 ; 3 .
We have to find the equation for d=--(a , 3)=~--3 ; the roots are = -Philo , 0 =y-a , = .
5 .
To apply the method above explained , write y=O , and therefore also d=O ; the roots thus become 01=3- , 0=--c , 0= -P3 , and we have the quadric and linear equations ( 9+o)(X-3)=0 , 0(c-3)=-0 , where ( a , ( 3 ) are the roots of the equation ( , 6 , ci , 1)=0 .
Hence , writing Z=-4ac-b2 , we have and the two equations become 0-a+dV/ -Z-c=O , da-/ --Z=0 ; or multiplying the two equations together , 3Oa2+ 20 +(3ac-b )+ / Z= 0 , which is what the required equation becomes , on putting therein d=O ; the coefficients of the complete equation are seminvariants , and the terms in d are to be inserted by means of this property .
The coefficient 3ac-62 is reduced to zero by the operator 3ab- , +26b , c+cb , it is therefore a seminvariant , and remains unaltered .
The coefficient cV/ -Z is what V/ E becomes ( D being the discriminant of the cubic equation ) on putting therein d=0 , it is therefore to be changed into i/ O. Hence 4 .
For the cubic equation ( a , b , c , dXv , 1)3 the equation for 0(=-(cc , f ) ) is 0= axE V-u x( +1 0 +3 ac +1 0l ) -1 b3 ' For the quartic equation ( a , b , c , d , e ?
v , 1)4-=0 ; 5 .
Here 0= -(C , , Y)= -(--3)(Y)(Y ) , the roots are 1-= -(7 , ) , the signs being in this case and indeed for an equation of any even order ) alternately =4( 7 ) the signs being in this case ( and indeed for an equation of any even order ) alternately positive and negative ; in fact , if the equation is represented by v=-0 , then the roots divided by r(a , j3 , y , b ) should respectively be p 'm , 'p3 , &lt; 'y , ' and this will be the case if the signs are taken as above .
H2 47 Putting now ==0 ( and therefore e=-0 ) the roots become 0 ==3 PIE ( P -Y ) , 2 =ya(y a ) , 8=3 , -p( ) , ?
4-4 where ( a , 3 , y ) are the roots of ( a , b , c , dXv , 1)3-0 .
Let Z denote the discriminant of the cubic function , then j(a3 , r)=v'/ -Z , and we have thus the linear equation ; the cubic equation is II,3{ P(y3 ) }=O , the coefficients of which can be calculated by the method of symmetric functions ( see Annex No. 1 ) .
7 .
The cubic equation being thus obtained , we have the two equations 03 .

-9ad'+ 4abcd--bd + ' d2/ 2 Z =0 =0 ; and multiplying these together , the resultant equation is 04 .

0+ 42 .
a2(9a2d2'+ 4abcd-b3d+ Z ) +d .
( 8a2d+4abc--b)d -/ -Z -dZ -0 , where the coefficients have to be completed by adding the terms which contain e. We have v/ D in the place of d/ -Z , and O in the place of --dZ .
The coefficient -8a2d+4abc-b3 is a seminvariant , and requires no alteration .
The coefficient 9a2d2+ 4abedb d+Z is 9a2d2+ 4abcd -b3d + 27a'2d-2 18abcd+ 4ac3+ 4b3db22 ; that is , +18a2d2 14abed + 4ac3 + 3b3d lb2C2 48 and the terms in e to be added to this , in order to make it a seminvariant , are easily found to be -16ace + 6abe .

Hence , for the quartic equation ( a , b , c , dXv , 1)4 , the equation for 0(==*(a , ,3 , y ) ) is 0= ( a4X a2 a/ Xx / O x ; x +1 .

Hence , for the quintic equation ( a , b , c , d , e , f , Jv , 1)5=0 .
the equation for ( -=( , p3 , 7 , ) ) is Oa6 X0 -125 a3cf2 + 300 a3def -160 a3e3 4+ 50 a2b2f2 +132 a2bde2 -130 a2bcef -120 a2bdf + 40 aec2df + 88 a2c2e2 -117 a2cd2e + 27 a2d4 + 28 ablef 97 ab5ce2 +6 ab2d2e + 62 abc2de + 66 abcdf 18 abcd3 24 abc3f 12 ac4e : +4 ac3d 16 b6df + 18 b4e2 -14 b3cde +4 b3d3 +6 6b32f +3 b2c3e 1 be2C2d2 a3^ Ux -50 a3df +-80 a3e2 +30 a2bef -54 a2bde -36 a2c2e + 27 a2cd2 8 ab3 +42 ab2ce -18 abe 'd +4 ac4 8 b4e +4 b3cd 1 b2c3 Ix t- ... ----'h -15 a'e +6 a2bd +4 ( ae2 5 ab2c +1 54 15 .
As a verification of this result , I remark that , taking for the quintic equation v5+v4-+v'3+v2+-v+1=0 , the roots of this equation are -1 , w , c2 , -2 , -2 , where w is an imaginary cube root of unity ( 2+'-+l=O ) .
We ought to have ( a , , 3 , 8 , e ) ---/ = -36 ; and this will be the case if , for instance , ac , 3 , 7 , , S are respectively -1 , o , g2 , -2 , -- .

The equation in 0 is thus ( 0-6)2(d+12)(d2+108)=0 , or multiplying out it is ( 1 , 0 , 0 , +432 , -11664 , +46656I , 1)4=0 , which in fact ( observing that v/ D=36 ) is what the preceding formula becomes for the equation ( 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , X1v , 1)5=0 .
The analogous verifications for the cubic and the quartic equations are as follows ; 16 .
For the cubic , if the assumed equation is v3+v2+v4-+=0 , the roots whereof are - , i , --i ( i2= -1 ) , then we should have ^(ao , 3 , y)= / -D =4i , which will be the case if a , / , ry=-1 , i , -i , respectively , and the roots y3--y , - , a--3 of the equation in 6 then are 2i , -i+1 , -i-1 , so that the equation in 6 is ( 02+2i--2)(0-2i)=0 , or ( 1 , 0o , 2 , 4i ~0 , 1)3=0 , which ( observing that y/ O =4i ) is what the formula for the equation in d becomes for the equation ( 1 , 1 , 1 , lXv , 1)3=0 .
17 .
For the quartic equation , taking this to be v4+v3+v2+v+1=0 , the roots are &amp; , 2 , c3 , 5 , where w is an imaginary fifth root of unity ( '4+W3+c2+c+1= 0 ) , and putting os , , y3 , , equal to w , 2 , , co4 respectively , we have -V/ O=( , j , r , y)= -5(~+Q4-CJ-W3 ) , giving , as it should do , 0 =125 .
The equation in D is therefore by the formula ( 1 , 0 , 0 , -25W+W4_-w2_-3 , 12501 , 1)4=-0 .
But the roots are d1= ( ^P7r , ) ( -2__3)(~2^_4)(W3_-4)= 2+ a2-23= 2 -X 0= -(r(y , s)= _(-_4)(-3_ )(4-_ )= -1+3w+2 2+ 3= --1+Y , == ~(~ , , 3)=(w'-w)(a'-_)(W -w)=-4-3~-s2 ~=-4-Y , 4=--( , ,y )=-( -2)(-_3)(-2_-3 ) 3+ ww2+2= 3+X , if , for shortness , X-~+2 3 , Y=3q+2-a2+-3 .
The equation in d is therefore ( 2+X)(+ 1 -Y)(d+4+Y)(3 -X)=0 , where the left-hand side is the product of the factors ( 0-2+X)(0-3-X)=02-50+6X-X2=-2-5+10-5(w +,4 ) and ( 0+1Y)(0+4+ Y)=+50+ 43Y-Y2=d2+50+10 5(-2+ 3 ) ; and the equation in 0 is , therefore , as it should be , ( 1 , 0 , ,-25w+4_ 2_--- , 1250d , 1)=0 .
Passing from the denumerate to the standard forms ; For the cubic equation ( a , b , c , d3v , 1)3 =0 , the equation for O(==(i3 , y ) ) is 0ax 9x t-270 x(+0+ ac +1 )3 .

I remark , with respect to the equation in 0 , for the cubic , that it leads at once to the equation of differences .
In fact we have a"23+9(ac-b+)O+/ -27 O =HI{--(c--3 ) } , a2x +1 0( 53 whence changing the sign of 0 , a203+9(ac-b2)d0--27 D-H3{0+(o-- ) } ; or multiplying the two equations and putting u for 02 , u{a1u+9(ac-b2)}2+27 D =-H3{u-(~--I)2 } , that is , the equation of differences is a43-+18(ac--b2)a"2+81(ac--b2)2u+27 El =0 ; but this mode of composition of the equation of differences is peculiar to the case of the cubic .
If in the several equations in d we substitute for the seminvariants the covariants to which they respectively belong , we obtain as follows:22 .
