THE property of numbers , which is the subject of this paper , first presented itself to my attention in the case of the odd squares 1 , 9 , 25 , 49 , &amp;c. ( 2n4 1)2 ; any two adjoining odd squares may be divided ( each of them ) into 4 square numbers , whose roots will have this remarkable relation to each other : two of them will be identically the same ; and as to the other two , one of them will be 2 less , and the other will be 2 more than the roots of the preceding or subsequent odd square ; for example , 25 and 49 may be divided into squares , the roots of which being placed below , will appear thus:25 49 so 49 81 -2,1,4,2 4,1,4,4 0,2,3,6 -2,2,3,8 or thus 0 , 0 , 3 , 4 -2 , 0 , 3 , 6 .
In comparing the roots of the adjoining odd squares , 2 roots ( placed in the middle ) are the same ; of the others , one is 2 more , the other 2 less than the corresponding roots of the other .
The following Table presents the result of a comparison of the roots of all odd squares up to 272 729:1 9 0,0,1,0 -2,0,1,2 9 25 0,1,2,2 -2,1,2,4 25 49 -2,1,4,2 -4,1,4,4 0,0,3,4 -2,0,3,6 49 81 0,2,3,6 -2,2,3,8 81 121 0,1,4,8 -2,1,4,10 -2,4,5,6 -4,4,5,8 -4,0,7,4 -6,0,7,6 MDCCCLIX .
121 169 -2,2,7,8 -4,2,7,10 169 225 0,3,4,12 -2,3,4,14 2,4,7,10 -4,4,7,12 -4,5,8,8 6,5,8,10 -6 , 4,95,6 -8,4 , '9,8 225 289 -4 , 3 , 10 , 10 6 , 3 , 10 , 12-6 , 5 , 10 , 8 -8,5 , 10 , 10 289 361 -2,5,8,14 -4,5,8,16 -6 , 3,12,10 -8 3 , 12 12 &amp;c. &amp;c. [ It is to be remembered , that throughout this paper the root of any square may be assumed to be positive or ?
egative at pleasure , and 0 is considered as an even square .
] This relation among the roots belongs also to the numbers resulting from the addition of any ( the same ) even number to the adjoining odd squares , and within certain limits ( to be noticed presently ) to the numbers resulting from the subtraction of the same even number : thus , 49-4=45 -2 3 , 4 , 4 0 , 0 3 , 6 49-2-47 -3 2 , 5 , 3 49 0 , 2 , 3 , 6 49+2=51 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 49+4=53 0 , 1 , 4 , 6 &amp;c. 81-4=77 -4,3,4,6 -2 , 0 , 38 81--2=79 -5 , 2 , 5 , 5 81 -2 , 2 3 , 8 81+2=83 -3 , 3 , 4 , 7 81+4=85 2,1,4,8 &amp;c. The addition may proceed indefinitely , but the subtraction has this limit : on deducting 30 from 49 , and also from 81 , the numbers become 19 and 51 , which are terms in the series 1 , 3 , 9 , 19 , 33 , 51 , &amp;c. ( 2n2+1 ) ; and any 2 alternate terms of that series will become by continued addition adjoining odd squares .
Any 2 alternate terms of the series may be represented by 2 .
( n-1)2+1 , and 2 .
( }+ 1)2 + 1 , or 2n2-_4n+3 , and 2n2+4n+3 ; add n2_-2 to each , and they become ( 2ne1)2 , and ( 2n+ 1)2 that is , adjoining odd squares .
If , instead of the odd squares , a series of the even squares +1 be assumed , the adjoining terms will have similar properties ; thus , 4+1=5 00 2 , 1 +1 , 0 ) 0 , 2 16+1=17 -2,0 , 2 , 3 -1 , O. 0 4 16+1=17 36+1=37 +1 , 0 , 0 , 4 -11.00 , 6 36+1=37 64+1=65 *-19 , ,4,4 3,2,4,6 And each of these may in like manner be increased , or ( subject to a similar limit ) be diminished ; these , however , are derived from the alternate terms of another series , 1 , 5 , 13 , 25 , &amp;c. ( 2n2+2n+1 ) , ( n.-e2)2+(n-1)2 , and n2+(n+1)2 will represent any 2 alternate terms of the series ; and if to 2n26n+5 , and also to 2n2+2n+l there be added 2n 2-2n , they become 4n2-8n+5 , and 4n2+1 , or ( 2n -"2)2+1 , and ( 2n)2+1 , or , adjoining even squares +1 .
The various examples of these or similar relations among the roots.of the 4 squares into which numbers may be divided are endless ; the increase and decrease of the variable roots is not always by 2 ; it may be by any other number .
But instead of multiplying examples , it will be better to enter on the proof of what has been already stated , which will furnish the means of investigating every instance that can be produced .
The proof depends upon , -1st , a general property of all odd numbers which ( as far as I am aware ) has not hitherto been noticed ; and 2ndly , a general theorem relating to odd numbers in arithmetical progression .
The property of odd numbers is this:-Every odd number may be divided into 4 squares , in such manner that 2 of the roots will be equal , 2 of them will differ by 1 , 2 of them will differ by 2 , 2 of them by 3 , and so on , as far as the number is capable ( from its magnitude ) of having roots large enough to form the difference required The difference may be algebraical , and result from one of the roots being considered as a negative quantity .
For example , there is only one mode of dividing the number 23 ( a number of the form ( 8n+ 7 ) ) into 4 squares ; these must be 1 , 4 , 9 , 9 , and their roots +1 ?
2 +3 , ?
3:3 and 3 are equal , difference 0 , 3 and 3 differ by 6 , 3 and 2 differ by 1 , 2 and 3 differ by 5 , 3 and 1 differ by 2 , 1I and 3 differ by 4 , 2 and 1 differ by 3 .
The differences of the roots may therefore be 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 or 6 ; a greater difference than 6 is ( in the number 23 ) impossible ; the least numbers that would make a difference of 7 would be 3 and 4 , and the sum of their squares would be 25 .
The same form or mode of dividing a number into 4 squares does not always furnish every possible difference ( as in the case of 23 ) ; thus 13 in one form has the roots 0 , 0 , 2 , 3 ; these furnish as differences 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 .
To obtain the difference 4 , the other form of dividing 13 into 4 squares ( viz. 2 , 22 , 22 , 22 ) must be resorted to , and then -2 , +2 differ by 4 : s0 39 has two modes of dividing into 4 squares ; in one the roots are 5 , -here are no equal roots ; but the other mode has the roots 1 , 1 , 1 , 6 , which furnish two equal roots .
Now it is well known that every odd number is of the form a2+b2+2c2 , that is , has 2 of its roots equal* ; also it is easy to prove that every odd number will have 2 of its roots differing by 1 , that is , will be of the form a2+b12+c2+ ( c+ 1)2 .
For any number of the form 4n+1 may be composed of 3 squares ( 4 are not necessary ) ; and as only one of them can be an odd square ( for if there were 3 odd squares its form must be 4n+ 3 ) , 4n +1=4a2+4b2+4c2+4c+l , and n ( any number ) a+ and 2n+1 ( any odd number ) =2a2+2b2+2c2+2c+1=(a ?
6)2+(a-b)2+c2+(e+1)2 ; but if 2 of the roots must be equal , and 2 of them must differ by 1 , it will be shown that all the other differences must exist .
Here I must request permission to introduce a new symbol , in order to denote a number so divided into squares as that 2 of its roots may have a certain difference ; these roots I always make the exterior roots .
I propose to place the index or number denoting the difference above the number to the left hand : thus 425 denotes 25 with roots 0 , 0 , 3 , 4 or -2 , 1 , 4 , 2 ; 725 may be -3 , 0 , 0 , 4 ; 24(2n2+1 ) maybe -n,0,1 , n. In order to complete the proof , I must now call attention more particularly to the properties of the two series already mentioned .
The first is 1 , 3 , 9 , 19 , &amp;c. , general term ( 2n2+1 ) ; it increases by the numbers 2 , 6 , 10 , 14 , &amp;c. , whose sum is ( 2n2 ) .
The second is 1 , 5 , 13 25 , &amp;c. , general term ( 2n2+2n+1 ) ; the increase is by the numbers 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , &amp;c. , whose sum is ( 2n2+2n ) .
The first is the series of the least odd numbers whose roots may differ by the even numbers .
The second is the series of the least odd numbers whose roots may differ by the odd numbers .
This is quite obvious : the number 2g(2n2+1 ) is -n , 0 1 , n ; any other odd number with the same difference of roots must be greater , -(n1 ) , 0 , 1 , n+ -= 2n 2+ 3 ; so ( 2n2+'2n4 1 ) , the difference of whose roots may be ( 2n+l ) ; -n , 0 , 0 , n+1 is the least number that can have that difference of roots .
These two series are mentioned as " the two series " during the rest of this paper .
They may be formed together by increasing from 1 , by the even numbers repeated ( 2 , 2 , 4 , 4 , 6 , 6 , &amp;c. ) ; thus , 1 , 3 , 5 , 9 , 13 , 19 , &amp;c. This series has alternately the terms of each , but 1 belongs to both-as 01 to the one , as 'I to the other .
Putting the symbol I have suggested above and the roots below , the first series will appear thus : 01 23 49 619 &amp;c. 28(2n2+1 ) 0,0,1,0 1,0,1,1 -2,0,1,2 -3,0,1,3 -n 0 1 , n The middle roots are all the same ; the exterior roots increase on the right and decrease on the left , by 1 , at each step .
The other series will appear thus : 11 85 513 725 941 &amp;c. 2f+1 ( 2n2+2n+1 ) 0,0,0,1 -1,0,0,2 -2,0,0,3 -3,0,0,4 -4,0,0,5 -n,0,0 , ( n+1 ) Here also the middle roots are the same , and the exterior roots increase and decrease in the same manner , by 1 , at each step ; but if any odd number have two of its roots equal , it may be the first term of a series of the first kind ; or if any odd number have two of its roots differing by 1 , it may be the first term of a series of the second kind ; any odd number may therefore be the first term of a series of either kind ; thus023 225 431 641 &amp;c. . .
2 ( 2n'2+23 ) +3,1,2,3 +2,1,2,4 +1,1,2,5 0,1,2,6 -(n-3)1,2 , ( n+3 ) or 123 327 535 747 &amp;c. 2ff'(2n2+2n+23 ) +1 , 3 , 3 , 2 0 , 3 , 3,3 -1 , 3 , 3 , 4 -2 , 3 , 3,5 ( n-1 ) , 3 , 3 , ( n+2 ) The middle roots are the same ; the exterior roots increase and decrease in the same way , and the terms of the two series increase by the same numbers , as if 1 were the first term of both ; the difference between any two adjoining terms is the sum of their indices ; if not adjoining , the difference between any two terms is the sum of their indices , plus twice the sum of the intermediate indices ; the roots which compose any odd number to a given index may therefore be found thus:-Let 117 be the given number , and 12 the required index ; then 0a , 2b , 4 6d 8 , lOf , 12117 will represent the series whose seventh term is 12117 : 0+12+2x(2+4+6+8+10)=772 is the difference between a and 117 ; a therefore =117-72 =45 ; and the series with its roots will be 045 247 453 663 877 1095 1o 2117 +2,1,6,2 +1,1,6,3 0,1,6,4 -1,1,6,5 -2,1,6,6 -3,1,6,7 -3,1,6,8 In the same manner 13117 may be discovered by the other series , and the result will be 133 337 545 757 973 1193 1 3117 +2,2,4,3 +1,2,4,4 0,2,4,5 -1,2,4,6 -2,2,4,7 -3,2,4,8 -4,2,4,9 What is stated above of 117 and the index 12 , is obviously applicable to any other odd number and any other index ; and it follows that if every odd number has two of its roots equal , and also two of its roots differing by 1 , it will have other roots differing by 2 , 3 , 4 , &amp;c. , as far as its magnitude will enableit .
There are various other modes of proving the same result .
If it be required to find the roots which make 9117 , begin with 1117 , 3121 , 5129 , 7141 , 9157 ; 157 is 40 more than 117 ; deduct 40 from every term , and the series becomes 177,81 589 9117 +1 , 6 , 6,2 -3,65,6,6 is +1,6,6,2 , and therefore9ll7 is -3,6,6,6 .
Obviously it is easy to throw the proof into a general algebraic form ; the general property of odd numbers above stated may therefore be considered as established .
The theoremalluded to is this:-If any odd number of odd numbers , beginning with 13 ( or any other number ) , be in arithmetical progression with a common difference of 4 [ or any other number ] ( for the purpose of this example let the series be 13 , 17 , 21 , 25 , 29 , 33 , 37 , with a common difference of 4 ) , then if the common difference ( 4 ) be assumed as the index of the difference of roots to the middle term in the series , and the higher terms beyond the middle have as indices of the differences of their roots ( 4+1 ) , ( 4+2 ) , ( 4+3 ) , &amp;c. in succession , and the lower terms have as indices ( 4 -1 ) , ( 4 2 ) , ( 4-3 ) , &amp;c. , the series with the indices will be '13 , 217 , 321 , 425 , 529 , 633 , 737 ; then if the terms less than the middle term be divided into four squares with exterior roots having the differences indicated by the respective indices [ which may be done by the property of odd numbers just proved ] , thus , 113 217 321 4251,22,22.3 2 -1 0 4,2 2,1 4,2 2,0,03 ) ' +1,092,4 0,0,3,4 then the terms greater than the middle term will have this relation to the terms less than the middle term , the two terms next to the middle term will have their exterior roots , -one , less by 1 , the other , greater by 1 , than those of the other .
The two terms next but one will have their exterior roots , - the one , less by 2 , the other , greater by 2 , and so on , increasing as the pairs of terms become more distant from the centre ; and all the pairs of terms ( equidistant from the middle term ) will respectively have the same middle roots ; thus 425 529 633 737 -2,1 , a4,2 0,0,2,5 _-2,2,3 , 4 -2,22 , 5 A~~~~~~~1 01 07 6 Comparing them , the result is as stated above ; the difference between the exterior roots of the respective pairs is half the difference between the respective indices .
The algebraic proof of this theorem is very easy .
Let there be an arithmetic series with n as a middle term and p as a common difference ; then the series with the indices of the differences of roots will be **.P`(n_2p ) , P-1(n-_p ) , Pen P+I(n+ p ) +2(n+2p , &amp; .
and any two terms equidistant from the middle term may be represented by ( n-mp ) , ( n+mp ) , and their indices will be ( p-m ) , ( p+m ) ; then if P-m(n-mp ) have its middle roots r , s , and the first of its exterior roots a , the other exterior root must be a+p -m in order that the difference of the roots may correspond with the index and equal ( p-m ) ; then the corresponding roots of n+mp will be , according to the theorem , ( a-ns ) , r , s , a+p , If the first set of roots be squared , the sum is a2+r2+s2+ ( a+-m)2= a2+r2+2+ ( a+p)2+m2-_ 2am,2pm if the second set of roots be squared , the sum is a2'2an+m2+r2+s2+(a+p)2 , which is 2pm more than the former ; if , therefore , the first sum of squares equals n-mp , the second will equal n+mrp ; therefore the pair of terms that are at the distance ( in ) from the centre will have their middle roots the same , and their exterior roots one less by m , the other greater by in than those of the other .
In this proof p , the common difference , may be odd or even , and n , the middle term , may be odd or even ; thus 22 O36 40 514 618 -1,0,0,1 -1,0,1,2 -2,1,1,2 -2,0,1,3 -3,0,0,3 is a series composed of even numbers , all of which obey the theorem ; but frequently an even number is not so divisible as to form the required difference .
To form every difference is a property which belongs universally to odd numbers only , not to even numbers ; the common difference may be only 1 ; the numbers from 25 to 41 are all ( both odd and even ) divisible into four squares , whose roots conform to the theorem , 33 being the middle term .
-725 -626 -527 -428 -329 -230 -131 032 4,0,0-3 5,0,0 , -i 5,1,1,0 2,2,4 , -2 5,0,0,2 3,2,4,1 3,3,3,2 0,4,4,0 133 0,4,4 !
1 941 840 739 638 537 436 335 234 -4,0,0,5 -2,0,0,6 -1,1,1,6 -3,2,4,3 +1,0,0,6 0,2,4,4 1,3,3,4 -1,4,4,1 To apply this theorem as a proof of the matters stated in the beginning of the paper , all the examples , whether of the odd squares , or of the even squares +1 , or those numbers increased or decreased , may be made terms in an arithmetic series ; 4n2-4n+1 and 4n2+4n+1 ( which represent any 2 adjoining odd squares ) have a difference of 8n , which is divisible by 4 , and therefore they may form terms in an arithmetical series ; thus 4n2-4n+1 , 4n 2-2n+l , 4n2+1 , 4n2+2n+1 , 4n2+4n+1 , the common difference being 2n , and the odd squares will be two places from the middle term ; their exterior roots will therefore be greater and less by 2 .
So any 2 adjoining odd squares , 4n2 and 4n2+ 8n+4 , differ by 8n9+4 , which is divisible by 4 ; and the adjoining even squares , +1 , may in like manner be made terms in an arithmetic series .
I propose now to apply the theorem generally to other instances of odd numbers having 2 roots equal and the other 2 roots differing by any number whatever , the one root being greater , the other less by that number ; for example , the alternate odd squares may be divided into 4 squares in such manner that 2 roots of the one may equal 2 roots of the other , and the differences of the remaining roots will be 4 : 19 949 0,2 2 , 1 -4,2 , 2 , 5 +1 , 0,2 , 2 -3,0 , 2 , 6 so the odd squares taken every third term , as 9 81 +2,0,1,2 -4,0,1,8 25 121 +2,1,2,4 -4,1,2 , L10 present a difference of 6 for the exterior roots .
The theorem affords a solution of all -these and every other instance .
For in the case of any arithmetical progression of odd numbers having an odd number of terms , the terms of which have been indexed as directed ( by making the common difference the index of the middle term , &amp;c. ) , it will be found that all the pairs of terms equidistant from the middle term are derived from 2 terms of one , or other , of the 2 series abovementioned by adding the same even number to both ; if the indices be even , they are derived from terms in the series 1 , 3 , 9 , 19 , &amp;c. ; if the indices be odd , the terms are derived from the series 1 , 5 , 13 , 25 , &amp;c. , and the terms in the series may immediately be found as they are the terms having the same indices as the pair of terms in the arithmetical progression .
Let 05 , 19 , 213 3117 , 421 , 525 , 629 , 733 , 837 be an arithmetic series ( with a common difference 4 and 21 the middle term ) indexed according to the theorem ; place under each term that term in either of the two series which has the index of the term in the arithmetical series ; thus 05 19 213 317 421 525 629 733 837 01 11 23 35 49 513 619 725 833 48 10 12 1-2 12 10 84 Deducting the one from the other , it is obvious that the terms equidistant from 21 are derived from terms of the two series , by adding to them the same number ; if the terms in the 2 series be adjacent , the difference of the exterior roots will be 1 , if alternate , 2 , and so on ; if the terms in the 2 series be m places distant , the differences of the exterior roots will be m : this may be shown generally in an algebraic form , thus .
Let the middle term of an arithmetic series be n and the common difference be an even number 2m , the series with its indices will be 2m-2(n .
6m ) , 2m-2(n.4m ) , 2m-f( ( n-2m ) , 2rn , 2m+l(n+ 2m ) , 2m+2(nf+ 4m ) , 2m+3(nf+ 6m ) , &amp;c. and the terms of the 2 series to be placed under each term will be &amp;c. ( 2m2-4m+3 ) , ( 2 -2-2m+1 ) , ( 2m2+1 ) , ( 2m2+2m+1 ) , ( 2m2+4m+3 ) , &amp;c. ; deducting the one from the other , the remainders will be n-(2M22+5 ) , ( n-(2M2+ 3 ) ) , ( n-(2m2+1 ) ) , n-(2n2+1 ) , n-(2m2+1 ) , n-(2rnW+3 ) , n-(2m2+5 ) , where obviously the remainders equidistant from the middle term are equal to one another .
Now the difference between the adjoining terms of either of the 2 series will always be divisible by 2 , the difference between the alternate terms will be divisible by 4 , the difference between 2 terms that are m apart will be divisible by 2m .
For the nth term of the series 1 , 3 , 9 , 19 , &amp;c. is 2n2+1 , and the ( n+m)th term is 2n2+4nm+2me2+1 , and their difference , 4nm +2m2 , is divisible by 2m .
So in the other series ( 1 , 5 , 13 , 25 , &amp;c. ) the nth term is 2n2+2n+1 , and the ( n+m)th term is ( n+M)2 ?
( n+m+ 1)2=2n2+2n+1 +2m2+4mn+2m ; and their difference , 2M2+4mn+2m , is also divisible by in .
An arithmetical series may therefore always be formed , which will give the required difference of the roots according to the distance of the pair of terms from the middle term .
The general result therefore is , that if any 2 odd numbers be assumed , they will either have this relation to each other of the roots of the 4 square numbers into which they may be divided , or a third odd number may be found , which will connect them together by having that relation to each .
If the 2 odd numbers be the result of an addition of the same even number to any 2 terms of either of the two series , they will have this relation of the roots , and the difference of the exterior roots will depend upon the distance of the 2 terms from each other ; and conversely , if any 2 odd numbers have this relation of the roots , they are derived from 2 terms of the same series by the addition of the same even number to both ; but if the 2 odd numbers have not this relation of their roots to each other , then a third odd number may be found having that relation to each of them .
Assume any 2 odd numbers as 13 and 105 , deduct 12 from each of them so as to reduce the smaller to 1 , and the other to 93 , the next term in either series less than 93 is 85 , 85+8 93 .
Select that term in the series to which 85 belongs , which by the addition of 8 becomes a term in the other series , this is 25 , 25+8=33 , and 33 is the number which connects 1 with 93 ; for 01 and 833 0,0,1,0 -4,0,1,4 have the relation which appears from their roots , and 733 and 1393 -3,2,2,4 -6,2,2,7 -2,0,2,5 -5,0,2,8 have a similar relation in two ways ; then add 12 to 1 , to 33 , and to 93 , and 13 , 45 and 105 will have this relation among their roots : 013 845 745 131O5 +2,1,2,2 -2,1,2,6 -3,2,4,4 -6,2,4,7 0,2,3,0 -4,2,3,4 -2,0,4,5 -5,0,4,8 -1,2,2,6 -4,2,2,9 MDUccLIx .
I It is obvious , that what is done with these numbers may be done with any other odd numbers , and it would be superfluous to give an algebraic proof This relation of all odd numbers to each other has not ( as far as I am aware ) been remarked before ; but it has occurred to me that possibly it may form part of the " mysteries of numbers " alluded to by FERMAT in that remarkable passage in which his theorem of the polygonal numbers was announced in a note to an edition of Diophantus , published after his death , p. 180 The mysterious properties of numbers referred to by FERMAT must ( of course ) be connected with the theorem he was announcing ; indeed he expressly refers to them as the source of his demonstration .
POSTSCRIPT.-May 20 , 1858 .
Since this paper was sent to the Society , some other theorems of a similar kind have occurred to me , in which the terms of a series ( not arithmetical of the 1st order ) have a similar relation with regard to the roots of the 4 squares into which they may be divided , that is , those which are equidistant from the middle ( if the number of terms be even ) , or from the middle term ( if the number of terms be odd ) , have the middle roots the same , and the exterior roots have an arithmetical relation to each other , varying with the distance from the centre , viz. the one being less and the other greater by the same quantity .
Thus , if any number of terms ( exceeding 3 ) of either of the 2 series above-mentioned , viz. 1 , 3 , 9 , 19 , &amp;c. ( 2n2+1 ) , or 1 , 5 , 13 , 25 , &amp;c. ( 2n 2+2n+1 ) , and , beginning with the ist term , the successive differences of the terms be added " i inverso ordine , " a new series will be obtained possessing the property in question ; thus the first seven terms of the Ist series are 01 , 23 , 49 619 , 833 , 1051 , 1273 ; the differences are 2 , 6 , 10 , 14 , 18 , 22 ; if the differences be added " inverso ordine , " beginning with 22 instead of 2 , the series becomes 1 , 23 , 41 , 55 , 65 , 71 , 73 , each term of which may be divided into 4 squares , whose roots will be as follows:01 223 441 655 865 1071 1273 0,0,1,0 +1,2,3,3 0,3,4,4 -3,1,6,3 -2,3,4,6 -3,2,3,7 6,0,1,6 +2,0,1,6 -1,2,5,5 0,0,1,8 +1 1 , 2,7 Here obviously the result is as stated above ; 55 is the middle term ; the terms equidistant from it have the same middle roots , and the difference between the other roots increases according to the distance from the middle term being 2 , 4 , 6 .
If 8 terms be so treated , there is no middle term ; the result is similar , but the successive differences are 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 .
The other series , 1 , 5 , 13 , 25 , &amp;c. , gives a similar result .
The reason of these results is that the equidistant terms are always equal to the original corresponding term in the series , increased by the same number ; thus , 41 and 65 =9+ 32 and 33 + 32 respectively .

There are certain numbers , which , added to the terms of the series in its ordinary state , convert it into a series whose differences have been added " inverso ordine .
" If the number of terms be 3 , add 040 If 4 , add.0 880 If 5 , add.0 12 16 12 0 If 6 , add.0 16 24 24 16 0 If 7 , add.0 20 32 36 32 20 0 If 8 , add.0 24 40 48 48 40 24 0 &amp;c. &amp;c. The law of the formation of these numbers is obvious .
These numbers apply to both series , and to any consecutive terms in either ; that is , [ e. g. ] 0 , 12 , 16 , 12 , 0 , added to any 5 consecutive terms of either series , converts them into 5 terms whose differences have been added " i inverso ordine ; " and what is still more remarkable , the middle roots of the first eight ( or indeed n ) terms having their differences added " inverso ordine , " are the middle roots which answer for any eight [ or n ] consecutive terms , whose differences have been added " inverso ordine " through the unlimited extent of the whole series .
Thus if the first 8 terms be formed with the differences added " inverso ordine , " 15 13 25 41 61 85 113 add 0 24 40 48 48 40 24 0 1l 329 553 773 989 11101 13109 '5113 0,0,0,1 0,2,4,3 -2,2,6,3 -10,6,6 -2,0,6,7 -5,2,6,6 -5,2,4,8 -7,0.0,8 +2,0,0,5 -1,0,6,4 +1,2,2,8 0,2,2,9 -4,0,6,7 -3,0,0,10 +1,0,4,6 -2,0,4,9 +2,0,0,7 -1,0,0,10 the indices and the roots of the squares will be as above .
Now take the 8 consecutive terms , beginning with 181 : 181 221 265 313 365 421 481 545 add 0 24 40 48 48 40 24 0 19181 21245 23305 25361 27413 29461 3`505 33545 -9,0,0,10 -9,2,4,12 -11,2,6,12 -10,0,6,15 -11,0,6,16 -14,2,6,15 -14,2,4,17 -16,0,0,1 -7,00,14 -10,0,6,13 8,2,2,17 9,2,2,18 -13,0,6,16 -12,0,0,19 8,0,4,15 -11,0,4,18 7,0,0,16 -10,0,0,19 the middle roots are the same for both .
These last matters add weight to the suggestion already made , that the properties of numbers referred to are connected with the " mysterious and abstruse ' " properties alluded to by FERMAT , as enabling him to prove the theorem he announced of the polygonal numbers .
