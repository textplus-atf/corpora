On the Difference in the Magnetic Properties of Hot-Rolled and Cold-Rolled Malleable Iron , as regards the power of receiving and retaining Induced Magnetism of Subpermanent Character .
By GEORGE BIDDELL AIRY , Astronomer Royal .
Received April 22 , -Read May 15 , 1862 .
IN reflecting on the differences exhibited by different iron-built ships in the change of their subpermanent magnetism , it has often occurred to me as a subject worthy of experimental investigation , whether a portion of this difference might not depend on the temperature at which the plates of iron are passed through the rollers in the last stage of their manufacture .
No favourable opportunity of making these experiments presented itself until , in the course of the last winter , I became aware that Mr. FAIRBAIRN had been engaged in experiments on the difference of the strength of plates of malleable iron , according as they had been rolled at a high or at a low temperature .
I immediately requested Mr. FAIRBAIRN'S kind offices for procuring for me bars adapted to magnetic experiment , divided into the four classes of-1 .
Hot-Rolled , with the length of the bars parallel to the direction in which the rolling had lengthened the iron , or parallel to the direction of fibre ; 2 .
Hot-Rolled , with the length of the bars transverse to the direction of fibre ; 3 .
Cold-Rolled , with the length of the bars parallel to the direction of fibre ; 4 .
Cold-Rolled , with the length of the bars transverse to the direction of fibre ( which classes will hereafter be described by the words , 1 .
Hot-Rolled Longitudinal ; 2 .
Hot-Rolled Transversal ; 3 .
Cold-Rolled Longitudinal ; 4 .
Cold-Rolled Transversal ) .
Upon Mr. FAIRBAIRN'S application , the bars which I requested were promptly and gratuitously furnished by RICHARD SMITH , Esq. , Superintendent of LORD DUDLEY'S Iron Works at the Round Oak Works near Dudley .
The number of bars was 24 , namely , 6 in each of the four classes above described .
Each bar was 16 inches long , 4 inches broad , and about ?
inch thick : the aggregate weight of the bars in each class was , --st , 28 lbs. 8 oz. ; 2nd , 28 lbs. 10 oz. ; 3rd , 27 lbs. 10 oz. ; 4th , 27 lbs. 8 oz. The manufacture of the bars is described to me in substance as follows:-The hot-rolled and cold-rolled bars were all manufactured in the same way up to the stage of producing sheets of iron of the desired thickness ; the last rollings having commenced with large bars at a welding heat , and having terminated with the bars ( now converted into sheets ) at a dull red heat .
Then the sheets to be cold-rolled were allowed to cool to a perfectly cold state , and in that state were rolled afresh between other rollers .
After this , the experimental bars were cut out of the sheets .
Each set of six bars was packed in one box , with the maker 's inscription on every bar reading forward in the same direction in all .
The bars when received by me , after resting some days in a room , were all placed upright in the same direction relatively to the direction of the maker 's inscription , and the distinctive number of the bar was painted on the upper end of each ; the end on which it was painted being that which is called " the Lettered End .
" The bars rested thus for several days , with the lettered end upwards .
The following apparatus was prepared for the experiments:-A wooden frame was constructed about 111 feet in length ; and this length , in the use of the frame , was placed very approximately in the direction of magnetic E. and W. Its ridge was 21 feet N. of the old front , or 13 feet N. of the new front , of the anteroom of the Magnetic Observatory .
The upper and essential part of the frame consisted of two planes , each about 2 feet broad ; of which one was very approximately in the position transverse to the direction of dip at Greenwich ; and the other , at right angles to the former , included in its plane the direction of dip .
These are called " Equatorial Plane " and " Dip Plane " respectively .
Ledges of wood were attached to the planes , for the support of flagstones resting on the planes and lying parallel to them .
And whether the wooden surface or the stone surface was employed , a frame of laths was placed upon it , which retained the length of each bar in the position nearest to the vertical , and prevented one bar from touching another .
In this position the bars were struck with a hammer .
If they were upon the equatorial plane , any induced magnetism was instantly struck out of them ; if upon the dip plane , they became powerfully magnetized , the lower end having the same properties as the marked end of a compass-needle , or being charged with austral magnetism .
For testing the magnetism , a vertical wooden rod was provided , carrying two horizontal planes or stages , also of wood .
The upper stage supported a prismatic Kater 's compass , with which a well-defined mark ( the ball-mast ) was viewed , and its apparent azimuth was read .
The lower stage supported the bar under experiment , which was placed in a horizontal position below the compass , at the distance of 5 inches , as nearly as could be conveniently measured , between the centre of the compass-needle and the centre of the bar .
The reading of the compass-card under view increases as the card turns in the direction opposite to that of the sun 's diurnal motion .
From this it will appear that when the end of a bar , which has been downwards on the dip surface , is placed eastward on the lower plane , the austral magnetism of that end will attract the needle 's south end towards the east , and will cause the card-reading to increase .
The bars were numerated as follows : ( Hot-Rolled Longitudinal ) Nos. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ( painted in white ) ; ( Hot-Rolled Transversal ) Nos. 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 ( painted in black ) ; ( Cold-Rolled Longitudinal ) Nos. 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ( painted in red ) ; ( Cold-Rolled Transversal ) Nos. 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ( painted in blue ) .
In the conduct of the experiments , the following rules were uniformly followed : The bars of the different classes were systematically intermixed , the same order being preserved in the whole series of experiments .
Thus the order in which they were placed upon either plane ( equatorial or dip ) , and the order in which their effects in disturbing the compass were observed , was always the following : Order of Order of Order of position , or No. of bar .

They were always placed on the experimental stage under the compass in the order 1 to 24 of the " Order of Position , or Experiment .
" A printed skeleton form had been prepared , and the entries in it of the compass-readings were made without the slightest risk of confusion .
The lettered end of the bar was always in the first instance placed towards the east ; and , as soon as the compass-card was read , the bar was reversed in length , and its lettered end placed towards the west , and the compass-card was again read .
The difference between these two readings ( which has been carefully verified by examination , and by collateral formation and difference of sums of readings ) is the number recorded in this paper .
The zero , or card-reading when no bar was near , was usually taken at the beginning and at the end of each experiment , merely to enable me to detect erroneous readings , but no further use was made of it .
In two instances in Experiment 13 , the presumption of error of 5 ?
( undetected at the proper moment ) was so strong , and the uncertainty as to the side on which the error was made was so great , that I judged it best to omit them , and to multiply the result for four bars by -- , in order to produce the result for six bars .
The " Diff. readings " in the following Tables denotes the excess , with its proper algebraical sign , of the compass-reading when the lettered end of the bar is East above the compass-reading when the lettered end is West , and is taken as measure of the intensity of magnetism of the bar .
When the bars have been struck with the lettered end downwards , the " Diff. readings " is positive .

2p2 275 The sign of the magnetism in this experiment is opposite to that which would have been given by terrestrial induction upon the bars in the position in which they had been standing for many days .
It appears therefore that the magnetism had been produced by some circumstance in the manufacture , and that the terrestrial action upon the bars in a quiescent state had not reversed or destroyed it .
The bars were deposited on the flagstones of the equatorial plane , lettered end upwards .

The magnetism , it appears , had very slightly diminished .
The bars were returned to the equatorial plane .
Experiment 3 , February 7 , 1h .
Each bar as it lay on the flagstones of the equatorial plane , lettered end upwards , was struck with three rather heavy blows , from the unlettered to the lettered end .
The hammer used was a geological hammer , weighing ( with handle ) about 23 lbs. , and it fell in the blows about 2 feet .
The bars were immediately examined .

Upon the whole , the antecedent magnetism is destroyed , and a small amount of magnetism of the opposite kind is left , but it is distributed very capriciously among the bars .
It seems to have no relation to the former magnetism .

If the first reading was correct ( which there is no special reason for doubting ) , it would appear that the bar lost one-fifth part of its magnetism in a few minutes .
The bars were returned to the dip plane , lettered end upwards .
On March 27 , 1h , they were moved to the equatorial plane , lettered end upwards .

The bar No. 20 does not appear to have undergone any further change in its magnetism .
After this , the apparatus was dismounted , and the bars were packed up in the same order as at first .
I shall now proceed to exhibit the principal results deducible from the details above .
For abbreviation , I shall sometimes use the expression " tendency 0 " to denote that the operation on the bars has been performed while they were lying on the equatorial plane ; " tendency + " to denote that the bars were lying on the dip plane , with lettered end downwards ; " tendency - " to denote that they were on the dip plane with lettered end upwards .

, and this requires a heavy blow ; but it is nearly or quite indifferent whether the bars are supported on stone or on wood , and whether the blow is given by an iron hammer or a wooden mallet .
This amount of magnetism , the bars lying with tendency 0 , is diminished in one or two days by about one-fifth part , and is scarcely diminished further in thirty days .
The loss of magnetism is not greater when the bars , instead of lying with tendency 0 , are placed in a tendency opposite to the magnetism with which they are charged .
When the charge of magnetism is smaller than the maximum , the diminution in a day or two is nearly in the same proportion .
It appears also that the effect of violence on the bars while lying with tendency 0 is not completely to destroy the magnetism ; and that sometimes the magnetism is actually increased by the violence .

It also appears that the cold-rolled longitudinal takes a heavier charge than the cold-rolled transversal .
The departures from this result , in Experiments 8 , 9 , 10 , 14 , are confined to small charges of magnetism , in which accident might have greater play .
They are also confined to magnetism of + character ; of this , perhaps , the following is the explanation .
The bars when received from the manufacturer had + magnetism ( see Experiments 1 and 2 ) .
It would seem therefore that the hot-rolled bars differ from the cold-rolled bars in this particular , that the hot-rolled bars retain rather more of their primitive magnetism , under all changes , than the cold-rolled bars retain .

The observed deviations are small , and a trifling accidental error may materially disturb the results .

would lead to a different conclusion ) , that there is a real difference in the retentive powers for magnetism among the different classes of bars ; and that the cold-rolled bars , under the circumstances of the experiments , lose less magnetism , spontaneously , than the hot-rolled bars lose .
If , instead of comparing the absolute losses of magnetism , we had compared the proportions for loss of magnetism in each class to entire magnetism in that class , the difference would have been still more remarkable .
