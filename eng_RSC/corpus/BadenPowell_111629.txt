In a series of papers inserted in the Philosophical Transactions ( 1835 , 1836 , 1837 ) , a 'd afterwards , in a more correct a'id complete form , in miiy Treatise I Oii the Undtilatory Theory applied ; o the Dispersion of Light ' ( 1841 ) , I endeavoured to investigate the great problem of the explanation of the uneqial refrangibility of light on the principles of the ua:dulatory theory , as proposed by M. Cauchy about 1830 , by nunierical comparison with the indices observed , morcespecially in cases of the monst highly dispersive media then examiiied .
The general result then arrived at was , that while the theory applied perfectly through aui extensive range of media of low and moderate dispersive power , it did not apply well to those of higher ; and to the highest in the scale ( which of course formed the true test of the theory ) it did not apply within any allowable limits of accuracy .
Since that time little has been done towards prosecuting the subject .
In the experinentalt part of the inquiry , about 1849 , T had observed the indices for a few new media : ; but these were not high in the scale ; yet though perhaps thus of little importance , I have now thought it as well to go through the calculation for them : the results are of the same general character as just described .
Soon after , finding that my friend , the Rev. T. P. Dale , F.R.A.S. , was desirous to carry on somiie researches of this kind , I placed at his disposal the apparatus with which I had determined all may indicest .
In 1850 that gentleman conrimunicated to the Royal Astronomical Society a short general account of his observations T relative to some substanices not very high in the scale .

a valuable series of determinations , evincing highly interesting results relative to the change of refractive power in various substances under different temperatures .
None of these umedia being high in the scale , they have little bearing oln the main object of my inquiries .
In two cases ( viz. water and alcohol ) the inidices agree so closely with miine , that it was not worth while to recalculate them .
In two other cases I have carried out the n-merical cormpariscon which afords a good agreement with the theory .

observations on several other media , especially phosphorus , a substance at the very summit of the scale , for which I had long been extremely desirous to obtain some determinations of indices * .
Among these results only two sets are in a form in which they can be made available for comparison with theory .
These are the indices for the standard rays in bisulphide of carbon , and for solution of phosphorus in that medium , which I have now calculated theoretically .
The results ( given in the sequel ) in both cases indicate discrepancies between theory and observation too great to be due to any reasonable allowance for error ; and we are confirmed in the conclusion before arrived at , that , for highly dispersive substances , the theory , IN ITS PRESENT STATE , is defective .
But these comparisons are all made by means of the same formula employed in my former researches , viz. that derived from Cauchy 's theory by Sir W. R. Hamilton , which he communicated to me , and which I explained in a paper in the Philosophical Magazinet .
Considering the unsatisfactory condition in which the questionl was left when tried by the test of the higher media in my former inquiries , it is a matter of some surprise that in the long interval since the publication of those results no mathematician has been induced to revise the theory .
Some criticisms indeed were advanced by Mr. EarnshawT , and others by Prof. Mosotti and the Abbe ' Moigno ?
, bearing on the general principle .
Sir W. R. Hamilton 's formula in particular was founded on certain assumptions confessedly but approximate .
It remains then a promising field for inquiry to analysts , whether a better formula might not be deduced , or other improvements made in the general theory , by which a method applying so well to lower cases miight be made equally successful for the higher .
Results of calculation , for Ether , Hydrate of Phenyl , Oils of Spikenard , Lavender and Sandal-wood , Benzole , Bisulphide of Carbon , and Solution of Phosphorus in that medium .
Three indices assumed from observation , viz. MB ' MF , and P. , give the medium constants , viz. D / F MB ' DI = IB + p. 2/ A , The values of the wave-length constants A and B for each ray , independent of the medium , are takeln from my Treatise ( Undulatory Theory applied to Dispersion , &amp;c. , Art .
270 ) .
Combining these , we obtain AD and BD ' for each ray in the medium .
Thence Sir W. R. Hamilton 's formula ( ib. Art .
237 ) gives for any ray , P= rF ?
( AD+BD ' ) ; the upper sign being used for rays above F , the lower for those below .

It may be owing to this circumstance that the assumption of that index may have occasioned the discrepanicy betweeni theory and observationl .
In oil of spikenard the accordanice is good .
In benzole the discrepancies are too great .

In the second case it is yet more clearly apparent that the theory is defective .
The ray C was not observed ; but the theoretical index is evidently in error to a large amotunt , as it is evren lower than that of B. The inidices for D and C are perhaps withini the litnits of error ; btut that of E is too nyiucil in defelt to be allowed .
