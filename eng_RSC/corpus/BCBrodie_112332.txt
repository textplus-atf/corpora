Received June 18 , 1863 .
( Abstract .
) In a former notice published in the 'Proceedings of the Royal Society ' ( vol. ix .
p. 361 ) , an announcement was made of the discovery of a new group of organic combinations , the peroxides of the radicals of the organic acids-bodies which in the systems of the combinations of these radicals occupy the same relative position as is held by the peroxides of hydrogen , barium , or manganese in the systems of the combinations of those elements .
An account was given of the mode of preparation and properties of two members of this group , the peroxides of benzoyl and of acetyl , C,1 H1o 0 and C4 H6 04 .
The present paper contains an extension of this inquiry .
In it is given an account of several other peroxides of monatomic radicals , the peroxides of nitro-benzoyl , of cumenyl , of butyl , and of valeryl , and also an inquiry into the action of the peroxide of barium on the bibasic anhydrides .
The nitro-benzoic peroxide is formed by the action of fuming nitric acid on the peroxide of benzoyl .
It stands to peroxide of benzoyl in the same relation as anhydrous nitro-benzoic acid stands to anhydrous benzoic acid , and may be regarded as derived from that peroxide by the substitution in it of two atoms of peroxide of nitrogen for two of hydrogen .
The formula of the substance is C,4 Hg ( NO2)2 0 .

38-33 332 100-00 100-00 The peroxide of cumenyl is procured by a process strictly analogous to that by which the peroxide of benzoyl is formed ; it has the constitution C20 I22 04 .
The peroxides of butyl and valeryl are prepared by the action of hydrated peroxide of barium on the anhydrous acid .
It is only necessary to mix in a mortar equivalent quantities of the two sub1863.J 655 [ June 18 , stances .
The peroxide is separated by solution in ether from the water in which it is dissolved and suspended .
These substances are dense oily fluids , exploding slightly when heated , but not so readily decomposible as the peroxide of acetyl .
The analysis of the peroxide of butyl , dried by chloride of calcium , gave results corresponding with the formula C8 HE1 O0 .

31-44 202 100-00 100-00 The mode of formation of these peroxides is given in the equation 2R , O0+Ba , 02=2Ba RO+R2 02 .
These substances are decomposed as well as formed by the action of the alkaline peroxide , according to the equation R2 02+ Ba202 =2 BaRO 1+0 , , giving a striking example of those consecutive actions referred to in a former paper as the cause of certain catalytic decompositions .
The action of the bibasic anhydrides on the alkaline peroxides is of special interest .
When anhydrous succinic acid , lactide , or anhydrous camphoric acid is mixed with an equivalent of hydrated peroxide of barium , a solution is obtained possessing the most powerful oxidizing properties , which bleaches indigo , evolves chlorine with hydrochloric acid , and oxidizes the protosalts of iron and manganese , but which does not discolour permanganic acid , or give with chromic acid the blue colour formed by peroxide of hydrogen .
When boiled , the solutions evolve oxygen , and afterwards contain a salt of the acid employed-in the case of succinic acid , giving a crystalline precipitate of succinate of 656 1863 .
] barium , and in the case of camphoric acid , giving with acetate of lead a precipitate of camphorate of lead .
These solutions are in a state of continual decomposition .
Only in one instance , that of camphoric acid , was it found possible to analyse the substance , and that only by indirect processes .
The oxygen contained in the organic peroxide was estimated in a measured portion of the solution by means of a standard solution of iodine ; the camphoric acid formed on boiling was determined by precipitation with acetate of lead in another measured portion ; and in a third portion the barium was estimated as sulphate .
The results of these determinations are given below , the camphoric acid being assumed as correct .
They lead to the conclusion that the solution contains the elements of one equivalent of anhydrous camphoric acid , one of oxygen , and one of baryta .

That the substance formed is to be regarded as the baryta salt of the peroxide of camphoryl , and not as the camphorate of the peroxide of barium , is proved by the reactions of the solution , which does not give peroxide of hydrogen when decomposed by acids , or a precipitate of the hydrated peroxide of barium when heated with a solution of baryta .
The organic peroxides constitute a new and peculiar group of chemical substances characterized by reactions never hitherto found in any compound of carbon , and which materially extend our views of the possible properties of the so-called organic combinations , and of their analogies to inorganic substances .
They are the organic representatives of chlorine in the same sense as the oxides of the compound ammoniums are the representatives of potash , and in a yet closer sense than ether and alcohol resemble the oxide and its hydrate , or than ethyl or marsh-gas are analogous to hydrogen .
This analogy is of a profound character , not consisting merely in the analogy of symbolic form , but in the absolute identity of reactions .
657 The admitted analogies of the peroxide of chlorine have as it were their maximum in the organic peroxide .
Not only is chlorine represented in the peroxide , but hydrocloric acid is represented in the organic acid , and a series of parallel equations may readily be constructed , showing the identical character of the reactions of the two classes of substances .
Both bleach a solution of indigo , oxidize the protosalts of iron and manganese , decompose water under the influence of sunlight , and evolve oxygen with an alkaline peroxide , forming the salt of the corresponding acid .
