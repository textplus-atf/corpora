C On Furfuraniline and Furfurtoluidine .
" By JOHN STENHOUSE , LL. D. , F.R.S. Received May 19 , 1870 .
In an epistolary communication to Mr. H. Watts *I stated that " The most abundant and economical source of furfurol is in the preparation of garancin by boiling madder with sulphuric acid .
If the wooden boilers , in which garancin is usually manufactured were fitted with condensers , furfurol might be obtained in any quantity without expense .
Furfurol is also produced by boiling any kind of madder with solution of sulphate of aluminium .
Crude furfurol , whether obtained from madder , bran , sawdust , or any other of its usual sources , is always contaminated with another aromatic oil , which I called metafurfurol .
This has a higher boiling-point , and oxidizes more readily than furfilrol , so that by repeated rectification almost the whole of it is converted into a brown resinous matter , which remains in the retort .
It is owing to the presence of this impurity that crude furfurol so rapidly changes its colour when kept , the metafurfurol not only being itself decomposed , but superinducing the oxidation of the furfurol .
A much simpler and more effective method , however , of purifying furfurol from this substance consists in digesting it for some hours with very dilute sulphuric acid , to which small quantities of acid potassium chromate are added from time to time ; this effectually destroys the metafurfurol and other impurities , so that the furfurol which distils over after being separated from the water and dried over fused chloride of calcium has a constant boiling-point of 161 ?
C. It has a much more agreeable odour than before , is nearly colourless , and may be exposed to the air under a layer of water for months , without any considerable increase of colour .
Its refractive index for the D line at 20 ?
C. is 1'520 t. Action of Fue furol on Aniline Furfuraniline .
Twenty years ago +I stated that when aniline was added to furfurol , the mixture acquired a rose-red colour , which it communicated to the skin , and likewise to paper , linen , and silk , but that these rapidly lost their colour , becoming of a brownish yellow , even when light was excluded .
I was unable , however , to obtain this red substance in a crystalline state .
In 1860 the subject was again examined by M. Jules Persor ?
, who dissolved aniline in acetic acid , and then added an excess of aqueous solution of furfurol ; after some time a deep red viscid mass was deposited on the sides of the vessel , which communicated to silk and wool a fine but very fugitive red colour .
Ile was not more fortunate than I had been in obtaining this substance in a crystalline state .
A few months ago I resumed the investigation of this subject , and although I was unable to obtain definite compounds either by the action of furfurol on aniline itself or on its salts when in a pure state , yet when furfurol was added to a strong alcoholic solution of aniline hydrochlorate containing an excess of aniline a deep red colour was produced , and in the course of a few minutes the mixture solidified to a crystalline mass of a fine iridescent purple colour .

tI am indebted to the kindness of Messrs. T. acnd I. Smith , of Edinburgh , for the greater portion of the furfurol employed in this investigation .
This firm has long been in the habit of manufacturing it for preparing furfurine for medical purposes .

Dr. J. Stenhouse on 538 [ June 16 , Furfuraniline hydrochlorate.-The best method of preparing this salt was to dissolve 46 parts aniline and 65 parts aniline hydrochlorate in 400 parts of warm alcohol , and then add 48 parts furfurol , likewise dissolved in 400 parts spirit ; after the solutions were thoroughly mixed , they solidified in the course of a few minutes to a mass of crystals of the salt .
When cold , these were thrown on to a filter , freed from the mother liquor by means of a vacuum filter , and washed with a small quantity of coloured spirit .
They were then readily obtained in a pure state by recrystallization from boiling spirit .
The substance analyzed was dried in vacuo .

It is soluble in boiling spirit , and crystallizes out on cooling in small needles of a fine purple colour , which acquire a metallic lustre on drying .
The crystals are permanent in dry air when light is excluded , but are readily decomposed when boiled with dilute acids or alkalies .
Furfuraniline nitrate.-This is prepared in a manner similar to that employed for the hydrochlorate : 23 parts aniline and 39 of nitrate were dissolved in 200 parts warm spirit , and 24 parts furfurol in 200 of spirit added .
The mixture , on being allowed to stand some time , became a semisolid crystalline mass , which was purified in the same manner as the corresponding hydrochlorate .

59-13 5051 12-17 23-19 100-00 TL 59'28 6'04 This nitrate is therefore C , 1118 N2 O , NO3 tI .
It resembles the hydrochlorate in its properties , but is much more soluble in boiling spirit , and forms larger crystals .
Furfuraniline sulphate.-When 23 parts aniline and 35 of its sulphate were dissolved in 3000 of boiling alcohol , and 24 parts of furfurol in 200 of boiling spirit added , the mixture became deep red , and on cooling deposited minute purple needles of the furfuraniline sulphate , contaminated , however , with colourless crystals of aniline sulphate .
When an attempt was made to separate these by crystallization from alcohol , the furfuraniline salt was mostly decomposed , with formation of aniline sulphate , which crystallized out .
Furfuraniline oxalate.-When aniline oxalate of aniline and furfurol were dissolved in spirit , as in the preparation of the salts above described , the solution became of a deep red colour , but did not yield crystals of oxalate of furfuraniline , only oxalate of aniline and a dark red tarry matter being produced .
Furfuraniline .
In order to obtain this base , a salt of furfuraniline ( the hydrochlorate or nitrate ) was ground up to a paste with water and strong aqueous ammonia added , the whole being intimately mixed until the purple colour disappeared , giving place to a pale brown .
Warm water was then added until the liberated base became soft and plastic , so that it could be needed in successive quantities of warm water , in order to remove the ammoniacal salts and free ammonia .
The base , as thus prepared , has much the pale brown glossy appearance of stick lac , and , like it , can be drawn out into strings when soft .
It is insoluble in water , but very soluble in ether and alcohol , and when hydrochloric acid is added to a strong spirituous solution it becomes deep red , and solidifies in a few moments to a mass of the purple crystals of the hydrochlorate .
The base decomposes , however , very rapidly when exposed to the air , or when boiled with alcohol , and will then no longer yield crystalline salts with acids .
The same effect takes place , but more slowly , in a vacuum .
Action of FuSfurol on Toluidine Furfurtoluidine .
When alcoholic solutions of toluidine and furfurol were mixed , there was no immediate change ; but after standing some time they acquired a red colour : asin the corresponding reaction with aniline no crystalline sabstance was produced .
Furfurtoluidine hydrochlorate.-The method employed to obtain this salt was similar to that used in preparing furfuraniline hydrochlorate : 12 parts toluidine hydrochlorate and 9 parts crystalline toluidine were dissolved in 150 parts hot spirit , and 8 parts of furfurol dissolved in 150 parts spirit added ; the mixture acquired a deep-red colour , and on cooling became a mass of minute acicular crystals closely resembling in appearance the furfuralinine salt .
It was purified by recrystallization from boiling alcohol , dried in vacuo , and analyzed .

Furfurtoluidine nitrate.-This was prepared in a manner similar to the hydrochlorate , substituting the equivalent proportion of toluidine nitrate : 14 parts toluidine nitrate and 9 parts toluidine were dissolved in 100 parts hot alcohol , and 8 parts furfurol in an equal quantity ( 100 parts ) of spirit added ; after standing some time the nitrate crystallized out in deep purple needles .
When purified and analyzed it gave the following numbers : I. '160 grm. substance gave 355 grm. carbonic anhydride and -098 grm. water .

373 100-00 It has therefore the composition C11 H22 N , NO , I-I .
Furfurtoluidine.-The salts of furfurtoluidine , when treated with ammonia solution , were decomposed in a manner similar to that already described under the head furfuraniline , but not quite so readily .
The crude free furfurtoluidine , when digested with ether , dissolved , and on filtering the solution , distilling off the ether , and drying the residue in a vacuum over sulphuric acid , the base was obtained as a brown amorphous mass , which is brittle and easily reduced to powder .
It is not as fusible as furfuraniline , and is far less readily decomposed .
A carbon and hydrogen determination of the freshly prepared base , purified by ether and dried in vacuo , gave the following results : I. '243 grm. substance gave -660 grm. carbonic anhydride and '159 grin .

Both furfuraniline and furfurtoluidine resemble rosaniline in giving beautifully coloured salts , whilst the bases are nearly colourless , or of a pale brown colour .
Furfurnaphthylamzine.-VWhen an alcoholic solution of furfurol was added to a similar solution of naphthylamine it immediately became of a red colour , which is as fugitive as the one obtained from aniline , but much duller .
Several attempts were made to prepare crystalline salts of this compound , but without success , only dark-coloured resinous substances being obtained .
Several other typical bases were also tried , but without any results .
These were quinidine , coniine , sparteine , and theine .
It appears , therefore , from these experiments , that it is only the bases of the aromatic series which combine with furfurol to yield these peculiar-coloured salts in a crystalline state .
I cannot conclude this paper without acknowledging the very efficient aid I have received from my assistant , Mr. Charles Edward Groves , in the preceding investigation .
