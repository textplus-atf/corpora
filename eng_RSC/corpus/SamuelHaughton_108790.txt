tPsw The brilliancy of a metallic surface depends on the coefficient of refraction , and there is , doubtless , some sensible quality , not yet clearly defined , which corresponds to the coefficient of reflexion , which indicates the power of the surface to form elliptically polarized light from incident plane-polarized light .
This quality might be provisionally named lustre .
It is very remarkable that gold , silver , and copper , which from time immemorial have pleased the eye of man , and been used as coins , should head the list of bodies possessing a high coefficient of reflexion .
Mercury , which has so brilliant a surface , and therefore heads the list in Table LXXXII .
, occupies a comparatively low place in Table LXXXIII .
, probably owing to its being a liquid , and its surface , therefore , in a less favourable condition than that of a solid for imparting elliptic polarization to an incident beam .
M. JAMIN has examined optically several of the substances mentioned in the preceding s2 123 On the Beflexion of Polarized Lightfrom , Polished Surfaces , Transparent and Metallic .

Introduction .
AMONG the experimenters who have made the reflexion of polarized light the object of their researches , there is no one to whom science is more indebted than to M. JAMIN , whose accurate observations are a model for subsequent observers .
His first paper on this subject was published ( 1847 ) in the 19th volume of the 'Annales de Chimie et de Physique , ' 3rd series , p. 296 , on Metallic Reflexion .
In this remarkable paper M. JAMIN verified many of the previous observations of BREWSTER , and added many of his own .
He employed two distinct methods in these experiments,1st .
The method of Comparative Intensities-by observing the relative intensities of the same beam of light reflected from a polished surface , composed partly of glass and partly of the substance to be examined .
2nd .
The gmethod of MuAltiple Reflexions , previously known from the researches of BREWSTER .
The optical constants used by JAMIN in this paper are(a ) The angle ( i , ) of maximum polarization .
( b ) The angle ( A ) whose tangent is the ratio of I to J , the square roots of the intensities reflected in the plane of incidence , and in the perpendicular plane .
( c ) The coefficient ( s ) used by CAUCIY , which is connected with the other two constants by means of theoretical equations .
By the first method of observation , M. JAMIN determines the constants i , and s for the following substances:1 .
Steel , 2 .
Speculum metal ; and by the second method of observation , he determines i , and A for 3 .
Silver , and i , for 4 .
Zinc , and gives the details of experiments on 5 .
Copper , from which the optical constants may be found .
next paper on Metallic Reflexion appeared in 1848 , in the Annals de Chim .
et de Phys. 3rd series , vol. xxii .
p. 311 .
In this paper he makes use of the second method of observation , by multiple reflexion , and gives valuable tables of the results of his experiments with the various colours of the spectrum on the seven following metallic substances : 1 .
Steel .
2 .
Speculum metal .
3 .
Silver .
4 .
Zinc .
5 .
Copper .
6 .
Brass .
7 .
Bell metal .
From these Tables the constants i , and A may be inferred .
In 1850 M. JAMIN published his well known paper " On the Reflexion of Light at the Surface of Transparent Bodies , " in the Ann. de Chim .
et de Phys. 3rd series , vol. xxix .
p. 263 .
In this series of experiments he used a new method of observation , founded on the Quartz Compensator of BABINET .
In this elaborate and important paper he publishes the details of his experiments on the following substances:1 .
Fire Opal , 2 .
Hyalite , 3 .
Realgar , 4 .
Blende , 5 .
Diamond , 6 .
Fluor-spar , 7 , 8 .
Two kinds of glass , and , in addition , gives in a Table at the end of the paper the constants of many other transparent bodies .
M. JAMIN has also published , in 1851 , in the Ann. de Chim .
et de Phys. vol. xxxi .
p. 165 , a memoir " On the Reflexion of Light at the Surface of Liquids , " in which he determines the optical constants of many liquids .
It occurred to me that the method of observation employed by JAMIN for transparent bodies might be advantageously used in the case of metals ; and I was thus led to commence the series of experiments the results of which are recorded in the following pages .
In these experiments I have added many metallic substances to JAMIN'S list , and have re-examined the metals observed by him by a different method .
In transparent bodies I have examined a few not experimented on by JAMIN , and investigated in detail the form of the reflected ellipse , under varying conditions of incidence and azimuth .
In the course of my paper I have employed for the second optical constant one more 82 readily determined than those usually employed , but which is readily deduced from the constants A and k of JAMIN .
At the close of the paper I shall give a Table containing a comparison of the constants found by JAMIN and myself for all the bodies which we have both examined .
Some years ago , in making observations on polarized light , I found that by adjusting properly the azimuth of the incident polarized beam , and allowing it to fall at the angle of principal illcidence , I could obtain a reflected beam of circularly polarized light .
On repeating the experiment with different polished surfaces , I found that the coefficient of refiexion , or whatever property it is that gives a surface a metallic reflexion , might be conveniently expressed by the cotangent of the azimuth at which an incident beam of plane-polarized light should be placed so as to give , on reflexion at the principal incidence , a reflected beam of circularly polarized light .
The following paper contains an account of my experiments on many substances , and a Table of their Coefficients of Reflexion and Refraction , determined with as much accuracy as I was able to attain with the instruments at my disposal .
The apparatus used by me consisted of a large graduated circle ( horizontal ) , provided with two moveable arms , each furnished with graduated circles ( vertical ) ; and the large horizontal circle was capable of being hung vertically , so as to allow of experiments being made on liquids as well as solids .
The substance to be examined was placed on a stage provided with adjusting screws , so as to bring the surface exactly into the centre , or intersection of the axes of the polarizing and analysing arms .
These arms were mounted with Nicol prisms , made for me by DUBOSCQ of Paris , and without sensible deviation .
The light employed was generally sunlight , but I sometimes used a mode:rator lamp with colza oil .
I employed the quartz compensator described by M. JAMIN* , for the purpose of converting the elliptically polarized reflected light into plane-polarized light , before allowing it to pass through the analyser .
The instrument used by me in making my observations on the reflexion of polarized light , was made by Mr. GRuBB of Dublin for the late Professor MCCULLAGH , and was presented to me , shortly after MCCULLAGI 's death , by his brother .
It is substantially the same as that described by M. JAMIN in vol. xxix .
Ann. de Chim .
et de Phys. ser. 3 .
I procured from M. DUBOScQ SOLEIL , of Paris , a compensator of JAMIN'S pattern , and had it adapted to my own apparatus .
In making my observations I used the following precautions:1 .
The zero of both polarizer and analyser was determined by direct observation with red sunlight , reflected at the angle of polarization of several glasses found to give a reflected beam capable of being completely cut off by the Nicol prism .
2 .
The Nicol prisms themselves were carefully tested and found to have no deviation .
3 .
Each of my recorded observations is the mean of four or five ; and when these differed from each other by more than 20 ' , I took the precaution of repeating them again , on another day , with my eye fresh and unfatigued , before I finally adopted my mean .
4 .
I frequently repeated the observations , with the incident light polarized at an equal angle , at the opposite side of the plane of incidence ; and also reversing the polarizer and analyser , so as to read the opposite sides of their scales .
The following definitions will explain the sense in which I use certain terms .
The Azimuth of a beam of plane-polarized light is the angle which its plane of polarization makes with the plane of incidence .
The Index of Refraction is the ratio which the sine of the angle of incidence bears to the sine of the angle of refraction .
The Coefficient of Refraction is the tangent of the Principal Incidence .
The Principal Incidence is that angle of incidence at which rays polarized in any azimuth have the major axis of the reflected elliptic light in the plane of incidence ; or at which the components of the reflected beam , in and perpendicular to the plane of incidence , differ by 90 ?
in phase .
This angle is nearly the same as BREWSTER'S Angle of Polarization or Maximum Polarization .
The Coefficient of Reflexion is the Cotangent of the Azimuth of an incident beam of plane-polarized light , which after reflexion at the principal incidence becomes circularly polarized .
The Principal Components of the incident and reflected light are the components in and perpendicular to the plane of incidence .
The following preliminary investigation will serve to show the principles on which I have tabulated the results of my experiments : Let the elliptically polarized reflected beam be represented , as in the annexed figure , inscribed in a rectangle , whose sides are parallel to OI and O P , the plane of incidence and perpendicular plane .
i Let 0x be the diagonal of the circumscribed rectangle , and Oy the axis of the ellipse ; it is required , from the difference of phase of the light in the planes 01 and O P , / and knowing the direction of the line 0 x , to find the direction of 0y and the ratio of the axes of the ellipse.:1 The angle x0 I== a ' is the azimuth of the reflected beam , measured by the analyser , after it has lost its elliptic polarization in the compensator ; and the difference of phase of 01 and 0P is measured in the compensator itself , by the displacement necessary to reduce the elliptically-polarized to plane-polarized light .
We may imagine , to aid our conception , but without hypothesis , that a material point traverses the ellipse , and that its coordinates are Z=A sin ( kt+e ) , ,=B sin ( kt+e ' ) , where e'-e is the difference of phase between the beams 0I and 0 P , and A , B are the lines 01 and 0 P. 84 Eliminating t , we find 5+ --2 cos(e'-e ) in2( ... .,. .
( l In this ellipse , the angle q made by the axis with the plane of incidence is found from the well-known expression 2E tan 2=--D_F belonging to the ellipse Dx22Exy+Fy2const .
Substituting for D , E , F their values from ( 1 .
) , we find tan 2p=tan 2 'cos(e'-e ) ; ... ( 2 .
) c denoting the angle yO I , and o ' the angle xO 1 .
But if a and b denote the axes of the ellipse , it can be proved that h2 ( D +F ) +(D -F)sec2 &lt; p -(D + F)(D-F ) sec 2p ' or substituting from ( 1 .
) and ( 2 .
) , ,= , / -cot ( + K ) cot ( j ' ) ... ... ... . .
( 3 .
) a=-/ --tan ( + ) tan( -i ' ) From equations ( 2 .
) and ( 3 .
) , I calculate the position of the elliptic axes and their ratio .
The angle c ' is obtained by direct measurement with the analysing prism ; and e'-e may be found , as follows , from the compensator .
In the compensator made for me by M. DUBOSCQ , I find that 39 43 represents the zero , i. e. the position in which the compensator affects equally the light in and perpendicular to the plane of incidence ; the number of graduations corresponding to a difference of half a wave ( 180 ?
) I found to be Red lamplight ( colza oil ) ... .
15'43 Red sunliglt ... ... 1537 White lamplight ( colza oil ) ... 13*29 If , therefore , C denote the reading of the compensator in any experiment , the difference of phase of the two principal beams will be expressed for red sunlight , in degrees , by the expression 1800 ( C39-43)X 15.37 and by a corresponding formula for the other kinds of light .
The angle thus measured by the compensator is not the difference of phase between the principal components of the reflected light until it is increased by 180 ?
, because experiment ' shows that in the act of reflexion there is this constant difference between 85 the two components , in addition to the varying difference of phase , depending on incidence , azimuth , and nature of polished surface .
We therefore use the formula '-e=180 ?
+ ( C-39 43 ) X 0 , ... ... . .
( 4 .
) where i denotes the interval corresponding to 180 ?
for the light used .
In tabulating my experiments , I give the original measurements of the analyser and compensator , and use the equations ( 2 .
) , ( 3 .
) , and ( 4 .
) to calculate the other columns .

The last column of this Table is thus found : Let the principal components of the incident polarized beam , in and perpendicular to the plane of incidence , be cos a and sin a ( unity denoting the incident beam ) ; and let I and J denote what a unit of light becomes after reflexion , in and perpendicular to the plane of incidence respectively ; then the principal components of the reflected beam are I cos c and J sin a , and therefore Y=tan ' cot ; ... ... ... .
( 5 .
) and the angle tan-'( ) may be found from this equation without any difficulty .
According to the theory of FRESNEL , J cos ( i+r ) I=cos ( i-r ) ' an expression which vanishes at the polarizing angle ( i+r-90 ?
) , and therefore tan- ' ( J ) ought at this angle of incidence to vanish also ; but we find , not only in this experiment , but in those which follow , that it does not vanish , but only reaches a minimum , the tangent of which is sensibly equal to what I have called the Coefficient of Reflexion * .
In fact , let x denote the angle whose cotangent is this coefficient .
Then I cos , J sin X are the principal components of the reflected light , which by definition is circularly polarized , and therefore I cos X=J sin X , and cot x=-I The coefficients of Refraction and Reflexion , as determined by this experiment , are therefore Coefficient of Refraction=tan 54 ? ?
