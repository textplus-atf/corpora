In the first stage of natural labour , the involuntary muscles of the uterus contract upon the fluid contents of this organ , and possess sufficient force to dilate the mouth of the womb , and generally to rupture the membranes .
I shall endeavour to show , from the principles of muscular action already laid down , that the uterine muscles are sufficient , and not much more than sufficient , to complete the first stage of labour , and that they do not possess an amount of force adequate to rupture , in any case , the uterine wall itself .
In the second stage of labour , the irritation of the foetal head upon the wall of the vagina provokes the reflex action of the voluntary abdominal muscles , which aid powerfully the uterine muscles to complete the second stage by expelling the foetus .
The amount of available additional force given out by the abdominal muscles admits of calculation , and will be found much greater than the force produced by the involuntary contractions of the womb itself .
The mechanical problem to be solved for both cases is one of much interest , as it is the celebrated problem of the equilibrium of a flexible membrane subjected to the action of given forces .
It has been solved by Lagrange ( Mecanique Analytique , p. 147 ) in all its generality .
In the most general case of the problem , the following beautiful thereom can be demonstrated:-Let T denote the tensile strain acting in the tangential plane of the membrane , applied to rupture a band of the membrane 1 inch broad ; let P denote the pressure resulting from all the forces in action , perpendicular to the surface of the membrane , and acting on a surface of one square inch ; and let p , and p2 denote the two radii of principal curvature of the membrane at the point considered .
Then we have the following equation:-P-Tx ( + - ) .
Pi P2 If the surface , or a portion of it , become spherical , the two principal curvatures become equal , and the equation becomes p 2T P In the case of the uterus and its membranes , the force P arises from hydrostatical pressure only , and is therefore easily measured , and the supposition of spherical curvature is approximately admissible .
It is evident from the form of the gravid uterus , that its curvature is greatest near its mouth ; and the equation shows that for a given hydrostatical pressure the tensile strain is proportional to the radius of curvature ; hence this strain will be greatest at the fundus of the uterus , in which part , accordingly , we find the muscular coat thicker than elsewhere .
If we assume the shape of the uterus to be that of a prolate ellipsoid , whose longer diameter is 12 inches , and shorter diameter 8 inches , its mean curvature will be that of a sphere whose diameter is 9'158 inches .
The volume of the gravid uterus is found from the expression 4 Volume =ra b2 ; in which a and 6 are the semiaxes , and xr is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter ; substituting for a and 6 their numerical values , we find the contents of the uterus to be 402 i3 cubic inches .
The surface of the gravid uterus may be found from the equation Surface =2 ( sin-e-keV/ e2 ) ; e in which e is the excentricity of the generating ellipse .
If the numerical values be substituted in this expression , it will be found that the surface of the uterus is 270'66 square inches * .
Some highly interesting conclusions may be drawn from the preceding calculations , combined with the weight of the total muscular tissue of the uterus .
Heschl estimates the weight of the uterine muscles at from 1 lb. to 1'5 lb. , M[ontgomery found the muscles of the gravid uterus to weigh 15 lb. , and Levret estimates them at 51 cubic inches , which , with a specific gravity of 1'052 , I find to be equivalent to 1'93 lb. Taking the mean of these estimates we have : Weight of Muscular Fibres of Gravid Womb .

Poppel estimates the contents at 300 cubic inches , , andi the surface at 210 square inches , If we suppose a ribbon , one inch in width , to be formed from the wall of the uterus , its thickness will be 0 1519 inch ; and as each square inch of cross section of muscular fibre is capable of lifting 102'55 lbs. , we find for the greatest tensile force producible by the contraction of the uterine muscles : Tensile strain of uterine 102 55 X0 1519 15577 lbs wall per inch ... ... J Substituting this value of T in the equation p 2T P and for p its mean value 9'158 inches , we obtain the maximum hydrostatical pressure inside the gravid uterus that can be produced by the contraction of its muscular fibres : Maximum hydrostatical pressure 2x 15577 _ 3.402 lbs. produced by uterine contraction J 9-158 This pressure , applied to a circular surface of 41 inches in diameter , is equal to 54'106 lbs. One hundred experiments were made by Duncan and Tait upon the hydrostatical pressure necessary to rupture the membranes which contain the liquor amnii , which are recorded in Dr. Duncan 's book* ( pp. 306-311 ) .
The greatest pressure observed was 3'10 lbs. , and the least was 0-26 lb. ; and I find that the mean rupturing pressure of all their experiments was 1*2048 lb. Combining this experimental result with the calculation already given , of the amount of pressure producible by the muscular tissue of the womb , we may conclude that the uterine muscles are capable of rupturing the membranes in every case , and possess , in general , nearly three times the amount of force requisite for this purpose .
In the second stage of labour , the voluntary action of the abdominal muscles is called into play to aid the expulsive efforts of the uterine muscles .
I have attempted to calculate the force available from the contraction of these muscles as follows .
The abdominal muscles are four in number , viz. rectus abdominis , obliquus externus , obliquus internus and transversalis .
The last three muscles form curved sheets , acting upon the corresponding muscles of the opposite side by means of tendinous aponeuroses which meet in the linea alba , and form the sheath of the vertical rectus abdominis muscle .
From the arrangement of all four , it is plain that the tensile force of muscular contraction in the curved wall of the belly , from the xiphoid cartilage to the symphysis pubis , is to be measured by the sum of the united forces of all the muscular sheets .
If we knew the force of each muscle , and the principal curvatures of the belly in the middle line , we could calculate , by Lagrange 's theorem , the hydrostatical pressure inside the abdominal cavity and available to expel fseces , urine , or a foetus .

In order to ascertain the force of the muscles , I measured carefully their average thicknesses in three subjects , of whom one was a young woman who had borne children , and the others were men of ordinary size and appearance .
The results obtained were the following : Thicknesses of Abdominal Muscles .

It has been ascertained by careful observations , that we must add 50 per cent. to the weights of muscles in the dead subject in order to bring them to the living weights ; this correction gives us 1*3035 inch for the mean thickness of the muscles causing tension in the central line of the belly , where the forces of all the muscles come into play together .
Multiplying this thickness by 102'55 lbs. , or coefficient of muscular contraction , we find T= 1*3035 x 102-55-= 33-67 lbs. This is the tensile strain producible by the contraction of the abdominal muscles along the curved central line of the belly .
It remains now to ascertain the principal curvatures of the abdominal surface , and to use the equation PT(1 +1 ) pi v so as to determine P , the hydrostatical pressure per square inch inside the cavity of the belly , and available , either in whole or in part , for the expulsion of the foetus during the second stage of labour .
In order to ascertain the curvature of the belly , I made experiments on three young men placed lying on their backs upon the floor , and made them depress and raise the abdominal wall as much as possible .
The result was as follows:-Taking a straight line from the upper part of the symphysis pubis to the xiphoid cartilage as the fixed line of comparison , it was found possible to depress the navel one inch below this fixed line and to raise it two inches above it .
When the belly was distended to the utmost by the action of the abdominal muscles , I measured the longitudinal and transverse curvatures by measuring the sagittas corresponding to a given length of tangent , with the following results : Nuimber..Diameter of Diameter of longitudinal curvature , transverse curvature , in .

4*0596 This amount of expulsive force per square inch is available , although not usually employed , to assist the uterus in completing the second stage of labour .
If we suppose it applied to the surface of a circle 4 ?
inches in diameter ( the usual width of the pelvic canal ) , we find that it is equivalent to 523*65 lbs. pressure .

In order to determine by actual experiment the expulsive force of the abdominal muscles , I placed two men , of 48 and 21 years of age respectively , lying on a table upon their backs , and put a disk measuring 1*87 inch diameter just over the navel ; weights were placed upon this disk and gradually increased until the extreme limit of weight that could be lifted with safety was reached ; this limit was found to be in both cases 113 lbs. As the circle whose diameter is 1 87 inch has an area of 2'937 square inches , the pressure perpendicular to the abdominal wall produced by the action of the abdominal muscles was P 11 .
_ 3847 lbs. per square inch , 2'937 a result which differs little from that already found by calculation from the actual measurements of the muscles and curvatures .
