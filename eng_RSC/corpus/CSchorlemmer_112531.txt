On the 2relation between Boilingpoint and Chemical Struicture .
It is from researches published only during last year that we have obtained a more definite klnowledge of the chemical structure of some of the hydrocarbons of the above series , so that we are enabled to explain the mode in which the carbon atoms are uinited .
This has been achieved by obtaining these hydrocarbonls by synthesis from other compounids , the structure of which is perfectly well known .
Thus Frieclel and Ladenburg* prepa-red , by acting upon methylehlor[CH3 acetol , C{ CH3 , with zincethyl , the hydrocarbon C7 II1 , , which they call CI3 carbdimetliyldiethyl , and which has the structure CC Ci5 .
Butlerow t lC 15 replbced in tertiary butyl alcohol the group -10 by hydrogen , and obtainied an isomer of diethyl to which he gives the nam-e trimetfi-Ylormen , 0 113 a cu3 .

to the Society I described di-isopropyl and amylisopropyl , and poiined out their constiutioi 3 ' Fiirther , Erlenmeyer has shown that ainvl alcolhol an-id butyl alcohol florumed by fermlenltation h3ave the following ' structur et : Btityl alcoliol .
Amiiyl alcolhol 0113 01-3 0H13 c 3.\ / K/ c 1 ?
C011 CH 20 H c~~~ 12011T U-H2 UH These two compounds contain , therefore , the group isopropyl , C0(C01)2 , which also must be present in the hydrocarbons derived from these alcohols .
All hydrocarbons of known structure may be arralnged in four groups ; the members of each group , which are liquids at the mean t6mperature of the air , exhibit a very regular increase in the boiling-point for each increase of CH1 , ist .
group .
Hydrocarbons in which each atom of carbonl is united with not more than two other carbon atoms , or in which the carbon iatoms are arranged in a single chain .
T'o this group belong the three lowest members of the series C0l 1-12 , +2 , of which lno isomers e.xist , as w , ,ell as ' diethyl , 04 11 , hebexyihydride , C - , , , derived from suberic acid 1 , and heptylhydride , C7,111G from azelic acid ? .
Ily reasolns for considering that the two last ones belong to this grouip are : ( 1 ) They boil at a hiigher temperature than their isomers of known structure ; and we fiuld that the simpler the mainier in , which the carbon atoms are combined , the hihler the boiling-point .
Thus we have , Di-isopropyl boils at 58 ?

CH3 C013 1132 CH 3 ( 2 ) The formationi of these hydrocarbons points out that they milust have a very simple constitution .
The acids from which they are derived arctl obtained by the splitting up of comiipoulnds containing , a large number of carbonI atoms , and from these acids they ( hydrocarbonis ) are derived by a fulrther scparation of carbon The difference in the boiling-points of hexvlhydride and heptyllhydride is 31 ?

100 53 The hydrocarbon C.H01 , , founid in American petroleum appears to be i(lentical with that prepared from suberic acid .
The higher specific gravity which the hexyilh dride from rock-oil shows , as observed by Cahours and Pelouze and by me , is occasionied by impurities .
As I iave shortly mentioned in my last commnrnication , I have stuidied the action of nitric acid upon this hydrocarbon .
On oxidizing in this way about 120 grms. , of which the boiling-Point was 67 ' to 695 and the specific gravity 0-6 709 , at 150 , about 10 grms. were left unattacked , which certainily must have been very pure .
This remaining portion boiled at 70 ' , and had the specific gravity 0-6651 ] at 1 6'5 .
The he-xy lby1Ddride which Erlenmeyer and WValnklyn prepared from mannite * also exhibits in its boiling-point and specific gravity a close agreement with the hydrocarbonl from suberic acid , and appears to be the same , Boiling-point .

-The members of this section are trimethylformen , amylhydiide , ethylbutyl , ethylamyl , and the bydrocarbon C8 , " '18 which I have prepared from the caprylalcohol , obtained from castor oil t. Trimethylformen boils at about 1Ia C. ; the other members are liquid at common temperature , and show the same difference in their boiling-points as those of the first group , namely 31 ? .

C:H3 CH3 4th group .
Hiydrocarbons in which one atomn of carbon is combinied with four other carbonl atoms.-Of this group only one member is known , namely carbdiinethyldiethyl , which boils at 860 .
It thus appears that from the boiling-point of a hvdrocarbon of the series C"H2n+2 conclusions may be drawn concerning its constitUtion , just as in the series of aromatic hvdrocarboris .
Further researches must show whether the law which I have pointed out in this paper is a general one .
