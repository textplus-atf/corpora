An account of experiments to determine the acceleration of the Pendulum in different latitudes .
By Captain EDWARD SABINE , of the Royal Regiment of Artillery , F.R. S. and F.L.S. Read March 8 , 1821 .
THE clocks and pendulums used in these experiments are the property of the Royal Society , and were prepared by their direction under the immediate superintendence of Captain KATER ; who , in a manuscript account presented to the Society , of the instruments furnished to the Expeditions on Northern discovery , has described them as follows : " The clocks were made by SHELTON , and are the same which accompanied Captain COOK round the world : for each clock a pendulum was cast in one piece of solid brass : this was furnished with a knife edge of hard steel perfectly strait , and finished by drawing the edge longitudinally two or three times on a soft hone , so as to take from its sharpness , and thus preclude any alteration from wear ; the back of the knife edge bore firmly against a stout cross piece , and the heads of the screws securing it , were sunk below the surface , and concealed by brass pins , to prevent their being removed : the knife edge was carefully adjusted , so as to be at right angles to the direction of gravity : a very firm support of brass was screwed to the thick plank which forms the back of the clock case ; in this were imbedded two pieces of agate , which were ground into portions of hollow cylinders , finished in their places to receive the knife edge of the pendulum : parallel to the agates a small level was fixed in the direction of the cylinders , by means of which they could be placed truly horizontal : an arc divided into degrees and tenths , but which might be read off by estimation to hundredths , was attached to the back of the clock case at the bottom of the pendulum , to give the arc of vibration .
Each clock was furnished with a triangular support of wood contrived by Dr. WOLLASTON , and so firmly arranged , that there appears no reason to apprehend any motion in the point of suspension ; and it is sufficiently obvious that no change can take place in the length of the pendulum , but such as may arise from a variation in temperature .
For the purpose of distinction , the two clocks and the two pendulums , are marked respectively No. i and No. 9 .
" To this description it may be added , that the clocks were cleaned and oiled by Mr. ARNOLD , in March 1818 , previous to the commencement of the experiments , and that these operations have not been needed subsequently .
The oil which was used was prepared by Dr. WOLLASTON .
The preparation consisted in submitting it to a low temperature , when the part which remained fluid was separated by a gentle pressure from that which had become solid ; the oil had undergone this process in the year 1803 , and had been laid by since that time .
The experiments , of which the account is now presented to the Society , were made in the course of two voyages of discovery in search of a North-west passage ; one in the summer of 1818 , and the second in the years 1819 and 1820 .
In the first of these voyages , the clock and pendulum marked No. 2 , were alone employed , No. i , being sent at the same time to Spitzbergen with Mr. G. FISHER ; but both the clocks being disposable when the second expedition was fitted out , they were both embarked , with a view of obtaining double and corresponding results .
It is designed to detail , in succession , the proceedings at each station , where an opportunity was afforded of landing and setting up the clocks ; and to conclude , by recapitulating the number of vibrations made by each pendulum in the different latitudes in which it was tried ; and by stating the deductions regarding the figure of the earth , which follow from the accelerations which were thus determined .
FIRST VOYAGE .
Island of Brassa , Shetland .
The ships having anchored in Brassa Sound on the goth of April 1818 , for the purpose of procuring a supply of fresh provision , and their stay , although designed to be very short , being understood to depend in some measure on the wind , the clock was landed , and , by the kindness of WILLIAM MOUATT , Esq. was set up in a lower room at Gardie House , i65 on the Island of Brassa .
It happened unfortunately , that in the interval between the goth of April and the 3d of May , on which morning the clocks were re-embarked to proceed on the voyage , the state of the weather was such as to prevent the use of the transit instrument .
The rate of the clock was therefore ascertained at this station by comparison with a chronometer , the accuracy of the result being of course dependent on the steadiness with which the chronotneter maintained its accustomed rate .
No. o104 of EARNSHAW , selected on this occasion , had been received on board on the 15th of April , with an assigned rate of gaining one second daily , founded on a trial of several weeks .
The longitude of Brassa is not ascertained with sufficient correctness to determine , by a knowledge of the error of the watch on mean time whilst there , the rate since the 15th ; but on the gth of June , being the first good opportunity of lunar observation which occurred subsequently , the Greenwich time obtained by the mean of several sets of distances taken by different observers , and with different instruments , agreed within four seconds of that shown by 1024 , with its rate for the interval of 56 days applied .
It may be also stated , as affording an inference that the rate had been particularly maintained during the early part of this interval , that a second chronometer of Mr. EARNSHAW'S , No. 815 , had been sent on board , also on the i5th of April , with a rate gaining o",54 daily , determined by a similar trial to No. 1024 ; on the ist of May 1024 had gained on 815 since the 15th of April 6,3 seconds , being only 6-tenths of a second less than the difference of their respective rates .
The latitude of Mr. MOUATT'S house 60 ?
o9 ' 42 " N. was ascertained by a mean of meridian altitudes observed in November 1818 , with a sextant and artificial horizon , by Captain PARRY , who on this and on all occasions most kindly studied to render me every assistance in his power , consistent with the due performance of his own duties .
The house being close to the sea , the height of the clock above low water mark was ascertained by direct measurement 24 feet .
In the subjoined table is given an account of the going of the clock , as compared with No. o124 ; the clock was set up on the afternoon of the 3oth of April , but the account was not commenced until time had been allowed for the pendulum to acquire the temperature of the room .
The temperatures and arcs of vibration are a mean of frequent observations in the times to which they correspond ; and as these were of irregular duration , the corrections due to the several means have been givenl an influence on the general correction , proportioned to the length of their respective periods .
The correction for the arc is the number of vibrations lost by the pendulum in 24 hours , from its vibrating in a circular , instead of a cycloidal arc ; the arcs being less than two degrees , the time of a vibration in a circular arc , whose radius is r : the time of a vibration in a cycloid whose axis is I r : : 1+ a : ' , ( a being the versed sine of the arc ) , and the errors arising from the greater length of the vibration in a circular arc being nearly as the square of the arc , when the number of vibrations lost by the pendulum at each station in 24 hours by vibrating in an arc of i degree has been ascertained , the corrections due to the arcs in which the pendulum did actually vibrate are obtained by multiplying the square of these arcs by the loss for one degree .
The correction for temperature is the reduction of the mean temperatures to 50 degrees , assumed as a convenient standard at which to compare the observations of the first voyage with each other , it being nearly the mean at which they were made ; the correction has been computed from the change in the length of the pendulum due to differences of temperature , the expansion of brass being considered +-oo220 inches per foot in 180 degrees of FAHRENHEIT .
The correction for the height above the sea , is the part of a vibration lost in 24 hours by the pendulum in vibrating at such elevation instead of at the level of the sea , the force of gravity increasing inversely as the square of the distance from the centre of the earth .
The differences of latitude being considerable between the stations at which the clocks have been set up , and the elevations being small , and differing but little from each other , it has not been deemed necessary to diminish this correction , by taking the geological character of the different stations into consideration ; the character is however noted wherever it was not previously well known .
The correction for the buoyancy of the atmosphere has been computed in the manner explained by Captain KATER , in his Account of Experiments for determining the length of the Seconds Pendulum , published in the Philosophical Transactions for i818 ; the specific gravity of the pendulum being considered 8,4 .

London .
No other opportunity of pursuing these experiments presented itself during the remainder of the voyage ; the ships having returned to England in the autumn of 1818 , the clock was disembarked to have its rate in London ascertained .
Mr. BROWNE having kindly permitted the observations for this purpose to be made at his house in Portland-place , the clock was set up in a room adjoining the one in which Captain KATER'S Experiments for determining the length of the seconds pendulum had been made ; the latitude , as stated by Captain KATER , being 51 ?

11 / I I:0 , SECOND VOYAGE .
It has been already noticed that both clocks were employed on the second expedition ; they were placed in my charge early in 1819 , to afford time for the determination of their rates in London previously to their embarkation .
The observations , of which the details are given in the subjoined Tables I. and II , were made , by Mr. BROWNE'S permission , in the room already described in Portland-place ; the rate of the chronometer with which the clocks were compared being supplied , as before , by Mr. BROWNE : the temperatures are corrected to 450 , being the mean to which all the observations of the second voyage are reduced ; On the return of this expedition to England in the autumn of the following year , 1820 , it was judged proper to repeat these observations , for the purpose of ascertaining whether any injury producing an alteration of rate , had been sustained by either of the clocks or pendulums during the voyage ; they were accordingly once more set up in Portlandplace , and their going compared with Mr. BROWNE 's excellent clock by CUMMING , the rate of which , losing o , l ' per diem , was furnished by Mr. BROWNE ; the details are comprised in the following Tables III .

Melville Island .
Only one opportunity presented itself in the course of the second voyage of setting up the Pendulum clocks ; this was during the detention of the ships at Melville Island , in the Polar Sea , in the winter of 18191820 .
The time aflbrded for the observations at this station was limited by the nature of the climate alone ; they were accordingly continued until the rates of the clocks were obtained with much accuracy : it has been thought proper , therefore , to give a more circumstantial detail of the proceedings at this station , than at those of the former voyage .
As soon as the harbour was determined in which it was purposed to secure the ships for the winter , and whilst a canal was cutting to admit them through the ice by which it was already occupied , its shores were carefully examined , with a view to select a suitable spot for an observatory .
The land was found of little elevation , and generally level , except where intersected by ravines , being the courses in which the winter 's fall of snow drained on dissolution to the sea .
The soil , which appeared by the banks of these channels to be many feet in depth , consisted of sand intermixed with small stones , being the debris of the sandstone rock of which the island is composed ; it was at this time consolidated by the frost , and was harder than the original rock , but much the greater part bore evident marks of being swampy at times ; and even the more elevated spots afforded little prospect of a solid foundation for the clock-stands on the return of summer .
However , as no preferable situation could be found within 177 such distance from the ships , as it would have been convenient , or indeed prudent , to venture , one of these was fixed on ; and it was hoped that by sinking the legs of the stands a few inches into the frozen soil , and by commencing the experiments as early in the ensuing year as the season should admit , they might be completed before the ground should be affected by a thaw .
It was desirable therefore to be thoroughly prepared before the severity of the winter should set in ; accordingly when the ships had been secured , and a party of men could be spared for the occasion , an observatory house was commenced .
The hlouse was built of the store plank and boards carried by the ships , care being taken to cut or injure them as little as possible ; the walls were weather-boarded , lined , and filled in between with moss ; the roof was protected by a tarpaulin covering : it was divided into two rooms , whereof the inner , being designed for the reception of the clocks , was warmed by pipes proceeding from a stove placed in the outer room ; the floors were boarded , and the walls furnished on the inside with Russia matting .
The house was finished and the clocks moved into it before the end of October .
If any hope had been entertained of being able to do more during the winter than merely to prepare for the return of more favourable weather , it was ended by the severity of cold , far exceeding expectation , with which November set in .
From this date until the close of March , the highest degree registered by a thermometer , suspended in the air , was + 6 ?
of FAHRENHEIT , and in no one of these five months did the mean temperature rise above -18 ?
; under such circumstances , an attempt to raise the temperature of the house , sufficiently to carry on the experiments , and to keep it up during their course , with the requisite steadiness and uniformity , must have altogether failed .
It may not be amiss to remark , that notwithstanding the house was as effectual for the purpose as the utmost liberality in the supply of materials , with no labour spared in their application , could produce , a very little wind with so low a temperature abstracted the heat with such rapidity , that the influence of the stove was scarcely felt beyond its immediate vicinity ; and a thermometer placed in those parts of the inner room where the clocks would have stood , could not be kept above zero , with such fire in the stove as it would have been prudent to maintain .
The clocks were therefore suffered to remain unpacked during the winter in the inner room , whilst the outer served a variety of useful purposes , which could not have been conveniently effected on board ship .
On the 24th of February , the matting with which the walls of the outer room were covered accidentally caught fire , and notwithstanding the endeavours of the persons who were present , the fire was communicated rapidly to the roof ; it was at length fortunately extinguished by the exertions of the officers and men from the ships , before the clocks or any part of their apparatus had received injury ; the packing chest alone of one was slightly scorched : the only personal sufferer on the occasion was an artilleryman , who had accompanied me on the voyage , and who , in his anxiety to place the instruments out of danger , exposed his hands incautiously , and was in consequence so severely frost-bitten , as to render necessary the amputation of three fingers of the left hand , and two of the right .
The house was speedily repaired , the outer room being reduced in size to a porch sufficient to contain the stove : ; and the inner room , which had scarcely been touched by the fire , remaining as before .
Towards the end of April the sun had influence to keep the thermometer a few degrees above zero for some hours of the day .
The clocks were now unpacked and set up : the flooring being removed , the legs of the stands were placed on sleepers sunk some inches into the frozen ground in grooves which were excavated by crow bars .
It may be worthy of remark , that when the boxes containing the thermometers which accompany the clocks were opened , the mercury was observed to be retired into the bulbs and frozen , although the temperature of the air had not been so low as the freezing point of mercury for several weeks .
The thermometer boxes were enclosed each with the pendulum to which it belonged , in a stout case of oak ; and these again were contained in chests holding each one clock with its apparatus complete .
The thermometers had been thoroughly cooled in their cases by the long continued severity of the winter ; but the warmth had not yet made its way through such a multiplicity of enclosures .
It may be also mentioned , in proof of the slowness with which such a mass of solid brass as constituted the bob of the pendulums conforms to the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere , compared with the mercury in the thermometer tubes , that several hours had elapsed , after the pendulums were taken out of their cases , ( when it is presumed they also may have been at -4o ?
) before they ceased to cause a deposit of moisture from the air of the room , which was about the same number of degrees above zero : the mercury in the thermometers , on the other hand , took up the temperature of the room within half an hour after their exposure .
The clocks were put in motion on the goth of April , and the account taken up on the 4th of May , the room having been kept at about the temperature of +45 ?
for the preceding three days and nights .
It proved however an erroneous supposition , that a sufficient interval to complete the observations would occur between the first return of mild weather , and the thorough breaking up of the frost : it was not indeed until the third week in May , that the weather became sufficiently settled or warm , to commence them to any purpose : during the first fortnight strong northerly winds prevailed with heavy snow drifts , preventing the reference to a meridian mark , and occasionally burying the house altogether beneath the drift snow ; when the only access to it was by digging down to the window of the room in which the clocks were going .
It was desirable to keep the temperature of the room at about the same degree as in the experiments in London , namely , about 45 ?
; but the mean height of the thermometer in the air during this fortnight was not more than +6 ? .
The walls of the house had been hung round with a double folding of canvass , and were well banked up with snow on the outside ; nevertheless , it was necessary to introduce the stove into the same room with the clocks to effect so great a difference of temperature , and even to place it not far distant from them .
It will readily be imaginedthat a forced temperature of such amount , and under such circumstances , must have been liable to incessant fluctuation and uncertainty , as indeed it was .
The thermometers were suspended in the clock cases in such manner that their bulbs were on a level with the bobs of the pendulums , and as near them as the extent of their arcs of vibration would admit : it is probable , therefore , that each thermometer was an index to the variations in temperature to which the principal-part of its pendulum was subjected ; but other thermometers , placed one or two feet higher in the clock cases , so far from corresponding , frequently differed many degrees from the lower one .
Every gradation between the temperature of the external air and that of the stove , might be remarked at the same time by thermometers placed in different parts of the room ; nor was it possible to provide against effects which changed with the situation of the sun and the direction of the wind .
The thermometer was registered frequently in the hour , but the result was necessarily very unsatisfactory .
Moreover , in consequence of the introduction of the stove into the room , the ground beneath the nearest legs of the stand were softened , and the levels affected , which might not have been the case could the room have been sufficiently heated by pipes .
The mean height of the thermometer in the air during the second fortnight in May was between 24 ?
and 25 ?
; it is probable that the registry of the temperature of the clocks became then an approximation to the truth ; but this is by no means certain , as there was yet very much inequality between the heat of the days and of the nights , the latter being still very cold ; but the effects of the heat acquired by the land were now becoming manifest every where , and advancing with great rapidity .
It was soon found impracticable to keep the levels in any thing like adjustment ; and by the end of the fortnight , the thaw prevailed to such an extent as to oblige the abandonment of the house , before any satisfactory conclusions had been obtained .
Towards the middle of June , the land was tolerably clear of snow in the neighbourhood of the harbour ; the mean temperature of the air had become but little less than that at which it was desired to carry on the experiments ; and the range of the thermometers in the course of the twenty-four hours had greatly diminished .
An elevated and dry spot was now chosen , and the earth being removed for nearly two feet in depth ( it having thawed above one foot ) , a foundation for the stands was made with as large stones as could be brought for the purpose , filled in with sand ; the clocks were then set up , and protected by a marquee , pitched , as at Hare Island , within a laboratory tent , a stove being placed at the door of the marquee with pipes leading through the tent .
The clocks were going on the 18th of June ; but a heavy gale of wind continuing through the two following days , forced the pegs and other fastenings of the tent on the weather side ( it being bad holding ground ) , and bore it down on the marquee , until relief was sent from the Ilecla , when the tent was permanently secured by ice anchors .
Whilst the marquee sustained the weight of the tent , the inner walls were unavoidably pressed in several places against the clocks and stands , which were shaken thereby ; one of the clocks was also stopped for the purpose of putting its pendulum in safety .
Thisdifficulty being passed , no other interruption took place to the success of the experiments .
The foundation subsided a little at first , but soon became sufficiently firm and steady ; a fire was generally required in the stove at night , but only occasionally during the day , the ternperature being very regular and satisfactory ; a thermometer suspended in the marquee on a level with the dial plates of the clocks , rarely differing more than one or two degrees at farthest from those within the cases .
In the following tables , [ A. B. C. ] an account is given of the going of the clocks from the 2oth of June to the 14th of July , when it was conceived that a sufficient number of results had been obtained , exclusive of those before the foundation had settled , which are omitted .
The times of transit were noted by a very steady going chronometer , No. 259 of Messrs. PARKINSON and FRODSHAM .
The distance being small between the tent and the observatory , the chronometer could be carried from one to the other , without inconvenience , as often as was required , by which means the comparison of intermediate watches was avoided .
The mark to which the transit instrument was adjusted previously to every observation , was about three hundred yards distant , being as far as could be distinctly seen at all times ; other marks were fixed in the prolongation of the same line at distances of one and a half , and three miles , by which the position of the first was occasionally verified .
The clocks were compared with No. 259 , ist .
At every revolution of twelve hours by the chronometer , the daily rate of which was less than two seconds ; the time of comparison was , whenever No. 259 showed seven hours , or more precisely of clock i , one minute before , and of clock 2 , one minute after seven hours ; the sun 's transit having preceded the comparison within half an hour .
The rate of g59 on mean time from one noon transit to the next , and from one midnight transit to the next , being added ( as the rate was always gaining ) to the gain of each clock on,59 in the corresponding interval , showed the gain of the clocks respectively on mean time , as deduced from transits of the sun .
end .
Clock 1 was compared at nine minutes , and clock 2 at eleven minutes , after a star had been observed to pass the middle wire of the transit ; the gain of 259 between the transits of the star being applied , as before , to the gain of the clocks on the chronometer , their rates were obtained in the intervals of sidereal time .
The temperatures were registered every hour , and the arcs of vibration every third hour : the temperatures were occasionally noted by the serjeant of artillery , the arcs always by myself .

The elevation of the clocks above the sea was ascertained i185 by a theodolite , the telescope of which being placed on a level with the pendulums , and adjusted horizontally , the height on the ship 's mast cut by the middle wire was carefully noted : this height was thirty-four feet six inches above the low water mark on a graduated tide pole , which was moored to the bottom near the ship .
The measurement was repeated with the magnetic transit instrument , and gave precisely the same result .
The distance between the station and the ship being about seven hundred yards , the true height may be considered thirty-four feet , the six inches being omitted in compensation of the distance .
The corrections due to this elevation are for clock 1 , +0,1413 , and for clock 2 , +0,1415 , making the final results 86466,4793 and 86571,858 vibrations in a mean solar day , in vacuo , at the level of the sea ; the temperature being 45 ? .
It has been noticed , that previous to the embarkation of the clocks on the voyage , they had gone for a few days in London with the pendulums interchanged , with a view to ascertain the comparative influence of the maintaining power of the , clocks , on the number of vibrations made by each pendulum .
The preceding observations having been concluded at Melville Island on the i4th of July , at which time there appeared no immediate prospect of putting to sea as no water was yet visible , a second series was commenced with the pendulums placed in the clocks marked differently from themselves ; the ships did not quit the harbour until the 1st of August , which afforded sufficient time for the completion of this series also ; and thus four results were obtained , instead of two , towards the deduction of the acceleration of the pendulum at Melville Island .

B b Results of the preceding operations .
It remains to recapitulate the results which have been detailed , and to state the deductions thereupon .
The acceleration of the pendulum between the stations visited in the first voyage has been already mentioned , viz. 83,107 vibrations between London and Brassa ; 32,1316 vibrations between Brassa and Hare Island ; And 65,2386 vibrations between London and Hare Island ; The following Table presents in one view , the results of the four series of observations , by which the acceleration between London and Melville Island has been determined .

It will be seen , however , that a mean of the results of either clock separately , coincides within a tenth of a vibration , with the mean result in the foregoing table .

I would also avail myself of this occasion , to express my personal obligations to those Gentlemen , for the opportunity which I have enjoyed of conducting these experiments ; and for which I am sensible that I am chiefly indebted to the statement they were pleased to make , of my competency to fulfil the purposes which the Society had in view .
