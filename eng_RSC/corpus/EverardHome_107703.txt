arrived at a like excellence in the use of the microscope ; for certainly POLI ( however splendid his plates ) cannot be put in competition with either of them .
When SWAMMERDAM died , and no one found himself equal to succeed him , a report was raised that his microscope was of a peculiar kind , and the mode of using it was lost at his death ; so it is now with BAUER .
Many applications are made to the mathematical instrument makers for a BAUER'S microscope , by those who are not willing to believe it is their inability , and not the fault in the microscope , that prevents their arriving at his excellence .
In all the insect tribe I have examined , the brain is formed upon the same general principle , but very different from that of fishes ; the brain is in one mass ; it is too small to admit of a particular description , but contains globules ; and from the readiness with which it dissolves upon exposure , there is no doubt of there being a fluid contained in it .
Besides this , which is admitted to be the brain of the insect , there is another substance connected to it by means of two chords .
This second part has been , I believe , usually called the first ganglion , but , when accurately examined , it is similar in its texture to the brain : the two chords which unite them are not properly nerves , since they are upon their first exposure turgid , but soon collapse .
These two substances with their uniting chords form a circle , and surround the oesophagus ; from the upper mass go off the optic nerves , those to the tentacula , tongue , &amp;c. From the lower mass go off the nerves to the upper extremities .
I shall therefore consider the upper as the brain , the lower as the medulla spinalis .
Below this is a regular line of ganglions , properly so called , being made up of a congeries of nerves , as the ganglions in the human body are now admitted to be .
The brain appears to be made up of two lobes .
The mass I call medulla spinalis , is also made up of two portions , united together by the two lateral chords .
The ganglions down the body of the animal are united -together by a double nerve .
The annexed drawings show this structure better than can be explained by verbal description .
Among the insect tribe the brain of the Humble Bee stands first , as being largest in proportion to the size of the body of the insect .
SWAMMERDAM has given a representation of the Bee : ; it is in general correct , but not so in respect to the optic nerves .
The Moth and Caterpillar have the same kind of brain , medulla spinalis , and series of ganglions , as in the Bee : the parts in the Caterpillar are nearly of the same size as in the Moth , but in both they are smaller than in the Bee .
SWAMMERDAM has given a correct representation of these parts in the Caterpillar of the Silk-worm , but none of the Moth .
The Lobster is similar in the structure of all these parts to the Bee , and although they are smaller in proportion to the size of the animal , they are still so large as to be readily seen , and explain what is not so distinct in the smaller insects .
The Earth-worm has a brain and nerves formed upon a smaller scale , but made up of the same parts .
In the Garden Snail , the brain and medulla spinalis are upon the whole larger in proportion to the size of the animal than in the Bee ; but in this animal , there are no ganglions , which may account for those parts being so large .
6 The clear and distinct representations which Mr. BAUER has given of these very minute objects , has made it unnecessary for me to take up the time of the Society in giving detailed descriptions of the different parts ; indeed any thing that is to be said , had better be stated in the explanation of the drawings , than connected with the general remarks which form the Lecture itself .
The Snail having a brain of the same kind as the Bee , and the medulla spinalis having a similar structure , while the series of ganglions is wholly wanting , forms one of the most curious parts of this investigation .
Having ascertained that , in all the animals , the structure of whose nervous system has been explained in the present Lecture , the brain is a distinct organ , varying in size it is true , till at last it is scarcely distinctly visible to the naked eye , but when examined in the microscope , found to consist of globules and elastic transparent matter , and more or less of a fluid , similar to the brain of animals of the higher orders ; that there is also at some distance from the brain , a second substance of similar structure , connected with the brain by two lateral chords ; and that this second part gives off the nerves that go to the different muscular structures of the body ; I consider myself borne out in the opinion that this part answers the same purpose ao the medulla spinalis .
The ganglions which form a chain connected so beautifully together by a double nerve , must be considered to have the same uses , whatever they are , as the ganglions in the human body , being equally composed of a congeries of nerves .
These are facts , which if they are allowed to be clearly made out , form an addition to our knowledge , and give confirmation to opinions not before satisfactorily established .
7 Here I shall conclude the present Lecture , neither Mr. BAUER'S time nor my own having admitted of our proceeding farther in this curious and interesting anatomical investigation , which I am not without hope , in the course of another year , of our rendering as complete as microscopical observations admit of , by examining the nervous system of a class of animals in which the existence of a brain has not been ascertained .
Till that is done , I must postpone any physiological remarks connected with the subject , all the facts belonging to it not having been determined .

The brain and nerves of the humble bee ; magnified ten diameters .
The brain is of a truncated oval form ; it gives off the nerves to the eyes and feelers ; its internal structure made up of globules .
The substance , corresponfding in its uses to that of the medulla spinalis , is nodulated on its external surface , connected to the brain by two long chords , which differ from nerves in collapsing soon after being exposed ; these I shall call crura cerebri : the lower portion of this nodulated structure corresponds to the medulla spinalis , and , in its internal structure , resembles the brain .
The two nerves that go down , connected at certain distances by small nodules , are different from nerves in being more pulpy , and the nodules themselves are composed of congeries of nerves , similar to the ganglions in the human body , of which there are many excellent representations before the public , which makes it unnecessary to show their structure upon this occasion .
Fig. 9 .
The brain and nerves of the garden snail ; magnified four diameters .
In this animal the brain is made up of two apparently equal portions .
As the appearance at the termination of the two large horns resembles eyes , and SWAMMERDAM has attempted to delineate the different parts of the organs : Mr. BAUER has shown the two nerves in different states .
The medulla spinalis forms a larger mass than the brain , but equally made up'of two distinct parts .
From the upper edge of this mass , there is an azagos branch going directly upward to the muses of thetongue , beyond which are the glandsof the mouith , -tndthe oesophagus cut through .
This nerve , so similar to the recurrent in the human'body , bily differing in being single , justifies me in having given the riafiie of spinal mrroi w to the part that gives it off Fig. io .
The point of one of the large horns , magnified fifty diameters ; to show thtit the external point of its termination in no respect 'resembles a cornea , but consists of five bundles of-nerVus filaments , the terminations of the branches of the lirve .

'n Fig. i , 2 , 4 , and 5 , the ganglions , as well as the brain and spinal marrow , are upon too small a scale to admit of acedrate examination , but in 'a large lobster , the distinction I have made between the brain and spinal marrow and the ganglions , was satisfactorily confirmed , and even in the earth worm it was sufficiently distinct .

I. The Croonian Lecture .
On the internal structure of the Human Brain , when examined in the microscope , as compared with that of Fishes , Insects and Worms .
By Sir EVERARD HOME , Bart. V.P.R.S. Read November 20 , 1823 .
AT the time this Lecture was instituted for the discovery of the principle on which muscular motion depends , the principle was supposed to be inherent in the muscular fibre itself : the numerous dissertations , therefore , which are registered in the Philosophical Transactions , are in general so many investigations into the properties of muscular fibres .
This part of the subject may be considered as completely exhalsted , although the principle on which the motion depends is not yet made out .
This leads me to believe that we must extend our enquiries to the structure of the brain and nerves before we can arrive at it .
It is now , I trust , universally allowed by physiologists , that muscular motion cannot take place in living animals without the aid of the medullary structure of which the brain and nerves are composed .
Every enquiry into the more minute parts of the brain and nerves , as well as their ganglions , must be carried on upon the field of the microscope , and Mr. BAUER , in consequence of the many valuable discoveries which have been made by his skilful use of that instrument , has too much zeal for science to withdraw himself from such pursuits .
Considerable advance has been already made in this enquiry by Mr. BAUER'S observations on the component parts of the blood , the formation of the embryo of the chick , and the component parts of the brain .
These observations are registered in the Philosophical Transactions , and the communications have been of so recent a date , as not to require that I should do more in this place than refer to them .
In the present Lecture , it is intended to pursue still farther the anatomy of the human brain , and to compare it with that of fishes , insects and worms ; in the hope that by the establishment of such a series of facts , we may throw light on the connection between the action of the nerves and the motion of the muscles .
The following circumstances explain the difficulties that are met with in the examination of the structure of the human brain .
The transparent elastic matter readily dissolves in water , and when in solution the globules become one confused mass .
The cortical substance containing serum , when it coagulates , is different in density from the medullary structure , and readily separates from it ; the serum also in drying cracks into regular figures , giving it an appearance of a net work which is artificial .
The globules and elastic substance being in different proportions in different parts of the brain , have an influence upon the appearance put on by the coagulum , which is a source of deception , and makes the coagulum tear more readily in some directions than others , as if fibres in those directions existed , which is not the case .
The parts not being of one uniform density , makes it impos sible for the sharpest knife to cut evenly ; some of the globules must therefore be displaced , while others are not .
When the brain is immersed in alcohol and rendered solid , all these deviations from the natural appearance must be increased in a greater degree , since the elastic substance is rendered opaque by coagulation , and all appearance of globules lost .
To obviate these sources of error , I requested Mr. BAUER to examine a small portion of the human brain in a recent state , composed of cortical and medullary structure , which had been immersed in distilled water : the surface of the elastic substance it is true , was dissolved , but what remained completely preserved its transparency ; the appearance the surface put on when magnified twenty-five times , is seen in the annexed drawing , rows of globules from the circumference of the cortical substance are passing unbroken in straight lines into the substance of the medullary portion , which could not have been detected in any other mode of investigation .
I shall not prosecute farther this part of my subject on the present occasion , but proceed to the consideration of the brain .
of fishes , ( that of quadrupeds and birds being in its structure so similar to the human brain , as not to require any notice of its peculiarities to be taken ) .
In the representation of the brain of the Tench , which is annexed , there is evidently a smaller quantity both of medullary and cortical substance in proportion to the size of the animal than in the bird , and its form is less compact , being made up of spherical nodules , medullary on the surface , and internally cortical : the basis of the brain is also nodulated , and in the centre is an oval cavity .
The nodules are upon so small a scale that their internal cavities are not to be distinguished , but in the squalus maximus they are very conspicuous .
I am now to point out the peculiarities of the brain in insects and worms ; but cannot tread upon the same ground on which SWAMMERDAM has preceded me , without paying a tribute of praise to that great man , who , labouring under such disadvantages as he must have done , in the age in which he lived , has performed so much , and in many instances has left nothing for those who follow him , but to bear testimony to the correctness of his representations and judgement .
There are some points in which lie gave way to public opinion , and did not disbelieve what every one said must be true .
I allude to his attempt to represent the eye of the garden snail at the point of the horn , which does not exist .
He found black retemucosum , which he mistook for nigrum pigmentum , and a pellucid part which he took for cornea .
To show this fallacy , I have annexed Mr. BAUER'S representation of these parts .
SWAMMERDAM has given a faithful representation of the nerve , which might have undeceived him , it having no resemblance to other optic nerves , but being like those commonly met with going to tentacula .
It is curious , that long as has been the intervening period of time between SWAMMERDAM and BAUER , no one has
