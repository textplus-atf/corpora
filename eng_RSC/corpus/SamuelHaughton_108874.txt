INTRODUCTION .
IN the Philosophical Transactions for 1858 , I have given an account of the Joints of the Old Red Sandstone of the co .
Waterford , and demonstrated in it the existence of the following Systems of Joints ( page 348):A. .

( Mag. ) 9§ 30 ' E. of N. , Since the publication of the foregoing account , I have found the system ( A , C ) in Donegal , Morn , Cornwall and elsewhere , and have reason to believe it to be the most important of all the joint-systems of Waterford .
I shall therefore call it the Primary System of Conjugate Joints , and the systems ( A ' , C ' ) and ( A " , C " ) I shall call 3o2 A " C " .
A " ' C ' .
correlated Secondary Systems of Conjugate Joints , as I believe that they can be shown to be simple mechanical consequences of the Primary System ( A , C ) .
Neglecting for the present the system ( A " ' , C " ' ) , the whole of the Joints of Waterford may be represented by the following diagram ( fig. 1 ) , to which I shall frequently have occasion to refer .
Fig. 1 .
It will be observed that the Primary angle between ( A ' ) and ( A " ) .

PART I.-ON THE JOINT-SYSTEMS OF THE CO. DONEGAL .
The following Tables give the bearings of all the joints observed , arranged according to their azimuths , together with the locality , and a statement of the rock in which the joint was observed .
In each locality several joints of the same bearing were measured but only one is recorded .

A very remarkable system of trap dykes pene\ trating the granite is exhibited in the railway cuttings from the Goragh Wood station to Slieve Gul^ lion , in the Newry Mountains .

It appears evident from\ / / \ the Table that they are all reducible to four systems , / two of which have directions closely corresponding with the joint-systems ( C ) and ( C ' ) already found .

404 The following notice of the Joint-Systems is founded on my own observations , with the exception of the two sets of observations made by Sir H. DE LA BECHE and Mr. N. WHITLEY , which I was permitted to copy by tracing from the diagram deposited in the Museum of the Geological Society of Cornwall , in Penzance .
Sir H. DE LA BECHE and other observers have noticed the relation between the directions of the lodes and of the joints in Cornwall .
This relation is even more intimate than they supposed , and extends to the Secondary Joints , which are well represented in the mines by theaunter Lodes , while the Cuonjugate Joints are represented by the Cross Courses .

The relation between the directions of the lodes and joints in Cornwall has been long known .
I was desirous of testing it in the Cam Brea district , and therefore asked permission of the officers of Carn Brea , Dolcoath , and North Roskear Mines to make use of their maps for the purpose ; .
the permission was readily granted , and I have here tabulated the results of my investigation .

This Table discloses a very interesting and unexpected result , viz. that , in Waterford , Donegal , Morn , and Fermanagh , the angle between the Primary and First Secondary Joint-Systems ranges between the narrow limits of 27§ 5 ' and 32§ 24 ' , and that in Waterford , Morn , and Cornwall the angle between the Primary and Second Secondary Joint-Systems ranges from 27§ 28 ' to 37§ 11 ' .
I hope to be able to show that this important result of observation is an easy consequence of the mechanical theory of Joints ; but before doing so , I shall prove by the following Table , that the theory of Conjugate Joints used in my paper on the co .
Waterford applies equally well to the other districts examined by me .

PART TI.-MECHANICAL THEORY OF ROCK JOINTS .
Rock masses are always arranged in sheets , whose dimensions in two rectangular directions are much greater than in the third direction at right angles to the first two .
Hence , when a system of forces acts upon such a mass , its first effect will be to produce a system of fissures at right angles to the plane of the resultant force .
When other forces are subsequently applied to the rock mass , already divided into bands by the parallel fissures , their effect upon these rock bands will be different according as they have a large vertical or large horizontal component .
In the first case the bands of rock will simply bend and break across along new fissures at right angles to the original fissures .
This cause produces the phenomena of conjugate joints , which have been described and accounted for by several writers , and have been fully discussed by myself in the paper , " On the Physical Structure of the Old Red Sandstone of Waterford , " so often referred to by me .
410 shall therefore direct my attention at present to the phenomena of Secondary Joints , which have been shown to take place along directions inclined at about 300 , on each side of the primary direction of the original joints .
Let xy , xy ' be the directions of two primary parallel joints , g , and let a force P , acting horizontally , tend to produce , a fracture in some unknown direction , ab , making an y ' angle 0 with the directions xy , x'y ' ; if the band of rock were capable of bending , this direction would be at right angles to the direction xy ; but if , from the'pressure of superincumbent rock masses , or other cause , it be prevented from bending , it will fracture along the line ab , which is the plane of easiest fracture , and whose direction 0 is thus found .
Let K denote the coefficient of cohesion of the rock , I the length of ab , and h the perpendicular distance between xy and x'y ' , and let = tan x denote the coefficient of friction of the rock .
The mechanical condition of equilibrium is evidently as follows : P cos 8=KI+pP sin 0 , or P cos -=-s +PP sin 0 ... ... ... ( 1 ) Differentiating this equation , regarding P as a minimum and therefore dP=O , we find Kh cos -Psin 0=-sin i +P cos ... ( 2 ) Equating the values of P deduced from ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we find sin 6 ( sin D+-p cos 0)=cos 0 ( cos --p sin 0 ) ; from which follows cos 20=p sin 20 ... ... .(3 ) or cot 2-= tan X ; and , finally , 20+= 90 ?
... ... ... ... ... .
( 4 ) The values of X , determined for various kinds of rock , limestone , sandstone , and slate , vary from 30 ?
to 38 ?
, thus giving for 0 corresponding values from 30 ?
to 26 ? .
These values agree very well with the angles between the systems of Primary and Secondary joints determined by the preceding observations in different localities ; and I believe that the mechanical cause I have assigned is the true cause of these joints .
From this it follows that a single hypothesis as to the direction of a system of forces is sufficient to account for the existence of three conjugate systems of joints , involving six directions ; and it also explains the rudely hexagonal jointing of many rocks , if the coefficient of friction be such as to render the angle d nearly 30 ? .
Many other consequences flow from the preceding investigations , into which I have not time to enter , but which may be readily found and tujned to practical use by the field geologist who prefers one hypothesis to many .
