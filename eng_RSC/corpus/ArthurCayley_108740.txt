TuE present memoir is intended to be supplementary to that " On the Double Tangents of a Plane Curve."* I take the opportunity of correcting an error which I have there fallen into , and which is rather a misleading one , viz. the emanants Ul , U2,. .
were numerically determined in such manner as to become equal to U on putting ( xi , y , z1 , ) equal to ( x , g , z ) ; the numerical determination should have been ( and in the latter part of the memoir is assumed to be ) such as to render HI , HI , , &amp;c. equal to II , on making the substitution in question ; that is , in the place of the formulae U1= ' 1 ) ( l ?
.+ylb+Zl.)2U , &amp;c. , there ought to have been U , = 'n(X2J ( $lal+Yl8+z la+)U5 U_**w &gt; eel ( Ya+M+ Za)2B &amp; v ( n-2)(n-3 ) y &amp; The points of contact of the double tangents of the curve of the fourth order or quartic U=0 , are given as the intersections of the curve with a curve of the fourteenth order 11=0 ; the last-mentioned curve is not absolutely determinate , since instead of HI=0 , we may , it is clear , write II+MU=0 , where M is an arbitrary function of the tenth order .
I have in the memoir spoken of HEssE 's original form ( say II , -O ) of the curve of the fourteenth order obtained by him in 1850 , and of his transformed form ( say 12=0 ) obtained in 1856 .
The method in the memoir itself ( Mr. SALMN 's method ) gives , in the case in question of a quartic curve , a third form , say 113=0 .
It appears by his paper " On the Determination of the Points of Contact of Double Tangents to an Algebraic Curve , " t ' that Mr. SALMON has verified by algebraic transformations the equivalence of the last-mentioned form with those of HESSE ; but the process is not given .
The object of the present memoir is to demonstrate the equivalence in question , viz. that of the equation IIH , = with the one or other of the equations 11=0 , 12=O0 , in virtue of the equation U-0 .
The transformation depends , 1st , on a theorem used by HESSE for the deduction of his second form 11T , = from the original form rIJ=0 , which theorem is given in his paper " Transformation der Gleichung der Curven 14ten Grades welche eine gegebene Curve 4ten Grades in den Beriihrungspuncten ihrer Doppeltangenten schneiden , " Crelle , t. lii .
pp. 97-103 ( 1856 ) , containing the transformation in question ; I prove this theorem in a different and ( as it appears to me ) more simple manner ; 2nd , on a theorem relating to a cubic curve proved incidentally in my memoir c " On the Conic of Five-pointic ContactSat any point of a Plane Curve " , * the cubic curve being in the present case any first emanant of the given quartic curve : the demonstration occupies only a single paragraph , and it is here reproduced ; and I reproduce also HESSE'S demonstration of the equivalence of the two forms II==0 and 2==0 .
Let U-=(*X3 , y , z)4 be a quartic function of ( x , y , z ) ; ( a , b , c , f , g , 7 ) its second differential coefficients ; ( A , B , C , F , G , H ) the reciprocal system ( bc-f 2 , ag2 , ab-h2 , gh-af , hf--bg , fg-ch ) .
And let H be the Hessian of U , or determinant abc-afo2--bg2-ch2+-2fgh ( H is of course a sextic function of x , y , z ) ; ( a ' , b ' , c , f ' , g ' , h ' ) the second differential coefficients , of 1H ; ( A ' , ' , C ' , ' , G ' , H ' ) the reciprocal system ( blc't-f 2 cla ' --2 , ab_ h'1,2 gh'--a f ' , ?
I-bg ' f 'g'-Ch ' ) .
Then TJ= 0 being the equation of a quartic curve , the equation of the curve of the fourteenth order which by its intersections determines the points of contact of the double tangents of the quartic curve , may be taken to be ( HESSE'S original form ) n,1=(A , B , C , F , G , nbH , 3H , -H , H)2--3H(A , B , C , F , G I , , by , a , )2H=0t .
Or it may be taken to be ( HESSE'S transformed form ) 11 , =5(A , B , C , F , X , G ( , xH , B , H , ,H)2-.3(A ' , B ' c ' , F ' , G , H'CxU , bU ; , BTU)2=0 .
And moreover , if U1-= ( x , a+yayz+ , ,)U , and if H1 be the Hessian of U , , and ( a " , b " , c ' , f " , g " , h " ) the second differential coefficients of H-3HI , where in the differentiations ( x , , yi , z , ) are treated as constants but after the differentiations are effected they are replaced by ( x , y , z ) , and if ( A " , B " , c ' , Fr " , " , H " ) be the reciprocal system ( b6"c flf 2 , c"a " -g al"b"'_ h " g"l " -a"f1 , h'f " --b " g fg -c h " ) , then the equation of the curve of the fourteenth order may be taken to be ( SALMON'S form ) A3II=(A " , B " , c " , U " , Gll , " H U , U , bU , , U)y=0 .
I have preferred to write the three equations in the foregoing forms ; but it is clear that the terms ( A , B , C F , G , nXa , , ) , a , )2H ; ( A ' , B ' , C ' , F ' , H , ' a , , )2U might also have been written ( A , B , c , F , Xa , H3a ' , , f ' , 2 ' , 2h ' ) ; ( A ' , B ' , , F ' , G ' , n'3(a , b , c , 2f , 2g , 2 ) .
As already noticed , it has been shown by HESSE ( and his demonstration is to be here reproduced ) that the two forms II=O0 and II-= 0 are equivalent to each other .
And the object of the memoir is to show that the third form 113=0 is equivalent to the other two .
The equivalences in question subsist in virtue of the equation U=O , that is , the functions II , , II2 , 113 are not identical , but differ from each other by multiples of U. Demonstration of HESSE'S Theorem .
Let ( a , b , c , f , g , h ) , ( a ' , b ' , c , f ' , g ' h ' ) be any systems of coefficients of a ternary quadratic function ; ( A , B , c , F , G , H ) , ( A ' , B ' , c ' , F ' , Ga ' , H ' ) the reciprocal systems as above , ( x , y , z ) arbitrary quantities .
Consider the function a =(a , b , c , f , g , hXx , y , z)2 .
( A ' , B ' , c ' , F , G ' , H'a , 6 , c , 2f , 2g , 2h ) -(A ' , BI , c ' , G ' , H'Jax+hy+gz , hx+by+fz , gx+ fie +cz)2 .
The term involving A ' is a(a , b , c , f , g , hXx , y , z)2--(ax+hy+gz)2 , which is =(ab-h2)y2 + ( ac--g2)2+ 2(af-gh)yz =Cy2+Bz -2Fyz ; and the term involving 2F ' is f(a , b , c , f , g , h)~x , y , z)2-(hx+by+fz)(gx+ fie +cz ) which is ( af-gh)x +(f bc)y + ( fgch)zx+(hfbg)xy -FxAyz+Hz x+ Gxy ; and the entire expression for O is thus A'(Cy 2+B z2-2Fyz ) + B'(A2+Cx-2Gzx ) + C'(Bx +Ay--2Hxy ) +2F ' ( -F2 x-Ayz+Hzx+Gxy ) +2G'(Gy2 -Bzx +Fxy + Hyz ) +2H'(-Hz2 Cxy +Gyz+Fx ) ; or what is the same thing , o =(BC'+B'C-2FF ' , CA'+C'A-2GG ' , AB'+A'B-2HH ' , GH'+G'H-AF'-A'F , HF'+H'F-BG'-B'G , FG'+F'GCH'-C'H(x , y , z)2 , which is really the fundamental theorem .
It is however used as follows ; viz. the righthand side being symmetrical in regard to the two systems ( a , b , c , f , g , h ) , ( a ' , 6 ' , ' , f ' , g ' , h ) , the left-hand side , which is not in form symmetrical as regards the two systems , must be so in reality ; or if O ' is what D becomes by interchanging the two systems , then O'= ; or substituting for O and O ' their values , we have ( a , b , c , f , g , hXx , y , ) .

If in particular ( a , b , c , f , g , h ) are the second differential coefficients of a function ^=(*(X , y , yz ) , )and ( a ' , b ' , c ' , f ' , g ' , h ' ) the second differential coefficients of a function u'=(*](x , y , z)P ' , then the equation becomes p ( p -1)u.( ( A ' , c ' , ' , G , H')6 , a3 , a , )2 --(p 1)2(A , B ' , C , F ' , G ' , n')au , ayu , a2)2.(_p'I)U'.(A , B , C , F , a , GIH -a b_Vl)2qu ( p _ )2 ( A I , B , C , F , I , GI:(ZbxU yc , a6 c)2 and if for u , u ' we take the quartic function U and the sextic function H , its Hessian , we have 12U.(A ' , Bi , C ' , ' , G ' H , 'b , b , , ) )U9(A ' , B , C ' , F ' , ' , H'aU , ,U , a , U)2 =30H.(A , B , c , F , G , H3a , , a a , )2H-25(A , B , c , F , G , H3u6 , H , aYH , aZH)2 ; and if in this identical equation we write U=0 , then from the resulting equation and the equation I , =-3H(A , B , c , F , G , Ha X , a , a)2H +(A , B , c , F , , , H(H , BH , BH)2 we may eliminate any one of the three terms ( A ' , Bf , C ' , F ' , G ' , HI ' ) aU , b , U , dZU)2 , H.(A , B , C , F , G , H a , ,ay , Z)2H , ( A , B , C , F , G , H 3d , H , YH , d , H)2 ; and in particular if the second term be eliminated , we obtain the equation I,2=5(A , B , c , F , H , HXa , H , yH , abH)23(A ' , B ' , C ' , F ' , GH'aU , ayU , -U)2 , and the equivalence of the two forms IT , =0 and I12=0 is thus established .
But HESSE'S theorem leads also to the demonstration of the equivalence of the third form 113= 0 .
To use it for this purpose , I remark that if ( a " , 6 " , c " f " , qg " , h " ) are the second differential coefficients of H3H1 , where after the differentiations x , , yl , z , are to be replaced by ( x , y , z ) , then the theorem gives 12U.(A " , B " , C " , F " , Gi " , Hi"ra , , a B)2U9(A , B " , c " , GF , G " , H"a , U , a , u , a , u)2 =(a " , " , c " , f " , g " , h~"x , y , Z)2.(A , B , c , F , G , HIIa , a , , aZ)2(H3 , ) -(A , B , F , cH , Hlax+h"y+_g"z , h"x+b"y+f"z , " x+f"y+c"z)2 .
But on putting ( x , y , z ) for ( x , , y , , z , ) we have ( since H is a homogeneous function of the order 6 , and H , before the change is a homogeneous function of the order 3 in ( x , y , z ) ) a"x+h"y+g"z=5b , H-3 .
2B , H=56 , H-3BH ( since , on making the substitution , HH but 3 , Hi-xH)=2 H ; and thus ( a"x+h"y+g"z , / " x+by+'f"z , g"x+f'y+c"z)=(2aH , 2aH , 2a , H ) ; and similarly , on making the substitution , ( a " , b " , c " , f , g"I , h"6x , y , z)=6 .
5H-3.3.2H , -(30-18)H=12H .
Hence writing therein U=O , the foregoing equation becomes -9(A " , B " , " , C " t , G , t11 " " X , U , B , U)2 =12H.(A , B , C , F , G , GHIl , Ha , a)2(H-3Ml ) -4(A , B , C , F , G , H)a , U , yu , bzU)2 , which may also be written -9(A " , if , c ' , p " , 't , GH"'b , U , ' , U , axu)2 =12H.(A , B , C , F , G , lI , , , a3H -4 ( A , Bn C F , G , r , G , H3U , aU , aU)2 , where ( x , , y , , z , ) are ultimately to be replaced by ( x , y , z ) .
The second line in fact vanishes , which I show as follows : Demonstration of my Theoremfor a Cubic Curve .
Let U-(* , Ix , y , z ) be a cubic function ; it may by a linear transformation of the coordinates be reduced to the canonical form x'+y'+3-3+6-lxyz , and we then have ( A , B , c , F , G , HiX ) , a , a)2H +6 ( yz-"x2).-61'x + ( zx-l 12 ) .
-612y + ( xy-l2ez).-612z +2(12yz lix ) .
( 1+213)x + 2(lzxly2 ) .
( l -+ 213)# +2(12xy-1 ).(1+21)z =1812iyz +614 ( 3 +y3 +z3 ) +612(l+-213)xyz--21(1 +213)(X3-+y3+z3 ) = ( -12 +12Pz)+ y2xyz+(+ + 2l1)(x3 +y3+z3 ) = 2(+ 14)(x3+y3 +z3+ 6 lz ) .
Or since -1+-4 is equal to the quartinvariant S , and the equation is an invariantive one , we have for any cubic function whatever ( A , B , C , F , G , GaH , , a , d , )2H 665=2S .
U , which is the theorem in question .
There is a difference of notation , and consequently a 361 different numerical factor in the theorem , as stated in the memoir on the conic of fivepointic contact , referred to above .
If , as above , U is a quartic function ( *Xx , y , z)4 , and U-=xIl-+y-lIy+-zla)U , then UJ1 is a cubic function , and we have ( Al , B1 , c1 F , , C , ,F HlJ , , a , a)2H , +65=2S .
U1 , where it is to be noticed that S1 denotes a quartic function in the coefficients of U , , and consequently a quartic function in ( ,5 y , , zJ ) , the coefficients being quartic functions of the coefficients of U. On writing ( x , y , z ) in the place of ( x , , y , , z1 ) , S1 becomes a quartic function of ( x , y , z ) , which is in fact a quarticovariant quartic of U. If in the foregoing equation we write ( x , y , z ) in the place of ( x , , y , , z1 ) , then U , becomes equal to 2U ; and consequently , if U=0 , the right-hand side of the equation vanishes .
Moreover ( a , , b , , c , , f , , g , , h , ) ( the second differential coefficients of U , ) become equal to ( a , b6 , c , f , g , h ) , and consequently the coefficients ( A , , B , , c , , Fi , G , ) become equal to ( A , B , c , F , , ) .
Hence , assuming always that U=O0 , the equation becomes ( A , B , C , F , H , I[ , a , )2H , =0 , where after the differentiations ( x , , y , , z , ) are replaced by ( x , y , z ) .
This is the form which is required for the present purpose .
Returning to the foregoing expression of 9(A " , BN " c " , Fr , G " I , l"HTax a , aU)2 , this now becomes -913=--9(A " , B " , C " , t " , o " , H"l ' 'U , B , U , B , )2 =4 3H .
( A B , c , F , G , 7a , H a , , a)H--(A , B , c , F , G , Hi U , U , a U)2 } , so that the equation 113=0 gives H , =-(A , B , C , F , G , HJ)U , U , B_U)2-3H.( , B , c , F , G , n3 , , B , a , )2YH=0 , and the equivalence of the equations II , =0 and 113=0 is thus established .
