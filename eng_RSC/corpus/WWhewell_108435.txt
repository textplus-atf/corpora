Researches on the Tides.-Fourteenth Series .
On the Results of continued Tide Observations at several places on the British Coasts .
By the Rev. W. WHEWELL , D.D. , F.R.S. Received October 24 , 1849 , -Read January 31 , 1850 .
TIDE observations made at several different parts of the British and the neighbouring shores , and in some instances continued for a considerable period , have been discussed by Mr. D. Ross of the Hydrographer 's Office , with great labour and perseverance ; and as the results which his labours afford may be of use to mariners , I offer to the Royal Society a brief statement of these results .
The discussions at present referred to relate to the height of high water , and the variations which this height undergoes in proceeding from springs to neaps and from neaps to springs .
It is found , by examining the observations at 120 places and throwing the heights into curves , that the curve is very nearly of the same form at all these places .
Hence the semimensual series of heights at any place affords a rule for the series of heights at all other places where the difference of spring height and neap height is the same .
For instance , Portsmouth , where the difference of spring height and neap height is 2 feet 8 inches , is a rule for Cork , Waterford , Inverness , Bantry , Boucout on the A French coast , and other places .
/ And the Tables of the height of high water at one of these places suffice for all the others , a con\s stant being of course added or subtracted according to the position of the zero-point from which the heights at each place are measured .
The series of heights of high water for a semilunation also agrees very exactly , as to the form of the curve , with the equilibrium theory .
The following construction gives this curve .
With centre C and radius CA ( half the difference of the height at spring and neaps ) , describe a circle ; and in AC produced take CD to CA as 12 to 5 .
Divide the circumference of the circle into twelve hours , representing the twelve hours of moon 's transit ; and join D with each of these divisions .
De The lines thus drawn to the hours will give the heights of high water for each hour of the moon 's transit ; a constant quantity being , as before stated , added or subtracted in order to refer the height to the proper zero .
According to the theory , the Oh or 1211 hour-points would be at A ; the ratio of DC to AC would be that of the lunar to the solar tide ; and the distances of the hourpoints from D would be the heights of high water above mean water .
But all these properties are , in the actual cases , modified in a manner which must be noticed .
The tides in these discussions are not referred to the transit of the moon immediately preceding , but to some earlier transit , namely , the second , third , fourth or fifth preceding transit ; it being found that in this way the accordance with the theory becomes more exact .
Thus in the British Channel the tides are referred to the third preceding transit ; and this extends also to Ireland and to the west coast of England and Scotland .
On the east coast of England , in the northern parts , as at Shields , Sunderland , Scarborough and Hull , the fourth preceding transit is used ; at Harwich , Sheerness and London , thefifth ( see Table B ) .
But this reference to an earlier transit does not make the highest tide correspond exactly with the hour of transit oh or 1211 : and it is found , in the cases which have been included in the present exatnination , that a displacement of the 0h point about fifteen minutes from A will best make the theoretical and the observed curves agree with each other .
The ratio of DC to AC is , as has been said , 12 to 5 ; and this , according to the theory , would be the ratio of the lunar to the solar tide .
If this were the case , the spring tide measured above mean water would be 17 , and the total spring tide above spring tide low water would be 34 .
The neap tide in this case would be 7 above mean water , and therefore 24 above spring tide low water .
Hence the difference of springs and neaps would be to the height of neaps above low water springs as 10 to 24 , a ratio constant for all places .
But in fact , this ratio of the excess of springs to the total height of neaps above low water springs is different at different places : and the observations now under consideration show in some measure the law of this difference .
The ratio is smaller when the tide is smaller .
This appears from the observations at different places , as arranged by Mr. Ross in the annexed Table A. We have there the following results , taking the means of groups of places according to the amount of tide .

If the ratio just spokenl of were constant , we should be able to find the 1height of mean water by knowing the excess of springs above neaps : the excess being 10 , the mean water would be 7 below the neap high water .
But it appears that in general the mean water is lower than this : and the excess of springs being 10 , the mean water is from 14 to 19 below neap high water at various points on the coast of Great Britain and France .
In consequence of the law of the high waters , given alike by the theory and by the observations , the spring high waters are above the mean high water for a longer period than the neaps are below it .
For it is evident that if DE and DF be each equal to DC , the heights are greater than the mean DC through the arc EAF , which is greater than a semicircle .
And it is evident that the excess of AE above a quadrant will be an arc of which the sine is gC or E ; or 12 ?
nearly .
Hence the two DC or Y4 portions of the semicircle will be , in time , 3h 24m and 2h 381n ; and the tides will be above the mean during 6h 48m of lunar transit , and below the mean during 51 12m ; and this is found to be very nearly the case at all the places examined ; thus confirming the identity of the rule of different places one with another , and with the construction given above .
229 Additional Note on the Tides of the Bristol Channel .
Mr. Ross has traced the modification which the semimensual inequality of heights undergoes in ascending the Bristol Channel from Pembroke to Bristol .
This modification is shown in the accompanying figure .
It appears from the diagram which 0123456789 10 11 12 Feet .

__J Mr. Ross has drawn from the observations , that the difference of springs and neaps increases gradually from Pembroke to Llanelly , Weston , Cardiff , and finally Bristol , the difference being 5 ft. 6 in .
at the first place , and 10 ft. 6 in .
at the last ; and the curve which represents the change from day to day being at all the places of the same form , namely , of the form described in the preceding paper .

For the places not otherwise marked in these Tables , the tides were referred to the transit immediately preceding , as giving sufficient exactness for general maritime purposes : but observations received at the Admiralty since the above laws were discovered , have been referred to the third , fourth , or fifth preceding transit , according to their place in Table B. The Devonport tides discussed some years ago , apart from those of neighbouring places , appeared to give the greatest exactness with the fourth preceding transit , which has accordingly been used in the Admiralty Tables .
There can be no doubt at present that the third preceding transit is Inore correct for this port ; but the labour of recalculating new Tables would be great , and the difference of the result would never be more than one minute in the time and one inch in the height .
