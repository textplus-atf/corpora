" By Sir FREDERICK POLLOCK , M.A. , F.R.S. &amp;c. Received February 23 , 1854 .
The object of this paper is in the first instance to prove the truth of a theorem stated in the supplement to a former paper , viz. that every odd number can be divided into four squares ( zero being considered an even square ) the algebraic sum of whose roots ( in some form or other ) will equal 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , &amp;c. up to the greatest possible sum of the roots .
" The paper also contains a proof , that if every odd number 2n +1 can be divided into four square numbers , the algebraic sum of whose roots is equal to 1 , then any number n is composed of not exceeding three triangular numbers .
The general statement of the method of proof may be made thus : two theorems are introduced which connect every odd number with the gradation series , 1 , 3 , 7 , 13 , &amp;c. , of which the general term is n+ n0 +1 or 4p'2+ 2p +1 ( that is , the double of a triangular number + 1 ) , each term of which series can be resolved into four squares , the algebraic sum of the roots of which , p , p , p , p+l , orp-l , p , p , p may manifestly be = 1 .
By these theorems it is shown that every odd number is divisible into four squares , having roots capable of forming as the sum of the roots 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , &amp;c. up to the greatest possible sum of the roots .
As the four square numbers which compose an odd number must obviously be three of them even and one odd , or three odd and one even , the differences of the roots among themselves must be the first odd and the third even , or vice versed ; and therefore these roots must have the sum of the first and third differences an odd number ; the middle difference may be either odd or even .
''he first of the theorems referred to , called by the author " ' Theorem P , " is in substance this : Let r , s , t , v be the roots the squares of which compose any odd number N , such that r+-s t+v= , and let each of these roots be increased by m ; then r+m , s+m , t+m , v+m will be the roots of the odd number N+ 2m(2m+ 1 ) ; and m-r , m-s , m-t , m-v the roots of the odd number N -2m(2m--1 ) ; the sum of the roots in the first case being 4m+l , and in the second 4m-1 .
So that giving to m successively the values 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , &amp;c. in the general form N+ 2m(2m+ 1 ) , a series will be formed in which the sums of the roots will be 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , &amp;c. , and the sums of their squares N , N +2.1.1 , N +2 .
1.3 , N+2 .
2 .
3 , N +2.2.5 , N+2 .
3.5 , N+2.3.7 , N+2.4.7 , &amp;c. ; or N , N+1.2 , N+ 2.3 , N+3 .
4 , N+4.5 , N+5 .
6 , N+6.7 , N+7 .
8 , &amp;c. So that if p be the distance of any odd number in this series from N , the number will be N+p(p+ 1 ) , and the sum of its roots will be 2p+ 1 .
The conclusions to be drawn from this theorem are then stated:1 .
The greatest sum of the roots of the squares into which any odd number can be divided may be obtained : for let 2n +1 be any odd number , and 2p +1 the odd number to which the algebraic sum of its roots is required to be equal ; then if p is such that p(p + 1 ) is less than 2n + 1 , the number 2n +1 can be resolved into squares the sum of whose roots is 2p +1 ; otherwise it cannot .
2 .
The form of the roots of 2n+ 1 may be found of which the algebraic sum is any possible odd number 2p+ 1 except 1 , provided all the odd numbers less than 2n+ 1 possess the property of having the algebraic sum of their roots =1 .
For if from 2n+ 1 , p(p+1 ) be taken , there will remain an odd number ( N in Theorem P ) such that , according to the condition stated , the algebraic sum of its roots = 1 ; and in the series of roots and odd numbers formed from these roots according to theorem P , p terms from N will be found the number 2n+ 1 composed of squares the algebraic sum of whose roots is 2p+ 1 .
It thus appears that any odd number 2n+ 1 can be divided into squares the sum of whose roots will equal 3 , 5 , 7 , &amp;c. ( any possible odd number except 1 ) if the odd numbers below it can be divided into squares the sum of whose roots =1 ; and if it can be shown that its roots in some form will equal 1 , then the theorem M will be true for that number and for every number below it .
This is illustrated by an example , and then another theorem , called " Theorem Q , " is stated .
In this a series of roots and odd numbers is formed by making the 1st and 3rd differences of the roots constant , but reversed every alternate term , and increasing or diminishing the middle difference by 1 each term ; -or the middle difference is made constant and the 1st and 3rd vary .
The sums of the roots thus oecome constant in every term of the series , but the sums of the squares of the roots increase , as in theorem P , by the even numbers 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , &amp;c. , so that the increase at any number of terms p is p(p + 1 ) , or the double of a triangular number .
By the application of these theorems to a variety of examples , it is shown how any odd number may be composed of four squares , such that the algebraic sum of their roots may equal 1 .
The theorems P and Q , it is considered , connect every odd number with every other odd number , so as to make it impossible if one odd number be composed of four squares , but that every other odd number should likewise be so .
It is pointed out in what manner every possible combination of numbers which can furnish the differences of the roots of any squares , not exceeding four , which can make an odd number , and the sum of which roots = 1 , can be derived from the gradation series , that is from 4p ' + 2p + 1 .
The combined effect of the theorems P and Q is therefore to prove that every odd number must be composed of not exceeding four square numbers .
The author goes on to show that every number is composed of not exceeding three triangular numbers , by proving that if every odd number 2n +1 can be divided into four square numbers the sum of whose roots = 1 , then n will be composed of not exceeding three triangular numbers .
This is done by taking the differences of the roots of 2n l , the algebraic sum of which roots is one , and diminishing the middle difference by theorem Q until it reaches a number nearest to half the sum of the first and third differences .
The difference between 2n +1 and the number thus obtained will be the double of a triangular number =-2T .
By the next step , the extreme differences are reduced until they are of the form m , m+ 1 ; and the difference between 2n+ 1--2T and the number thus obtained will again be the double of a triangular number =2T1o The differences last obtained give the double of a triangular number +1 =2T " +1 So that we find 2n +1 =2T + 2Tt + 2T " + 1 .
Consequently n= the sum of three triangular numbers , if all the three operations be necessary ; if not , to two or one triangular number only .
