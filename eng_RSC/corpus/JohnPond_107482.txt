n the parallax of a Aqui ! .
By John Pond , F. R. S. Astronomer Royal Read April 16 , i818 .
iHE telescope erected for the investigation of the parallax of a Aquilae , exactly resembles in its construction that which was employed for the observations of a Cygni .
It has an achromatic object glass of ten feet focal length , and four inches diameter .
I had at first selected 3 Canis minoris , as a proper star to be compared with a Aquilae ; but I found upon trial that it could not be seen in the day time , except under such favourable circumstances as could seldom be expected .
I considered this at the time as a great disappointment ; but I now find that the star ( I Pegasi ) which I have substituted for it , is much better situated for the purpose .
It has often been proposed to examine the parallax of a large star by comparing it with a smaller one ; but to do this by meridian observations is very difficult , and in most cases impossible , from some peculiar practical difficulties which I am about to state .
For example : in the present case of a Aquila , the smaller star must have very nearly the same polar distance .
If it follows the larger star within three hours of right ascension , it cannot be employed for this purpose , because in winter time it will pass the meridian before sun set ; should the smaller star differ four hours or more in right ascension from the larger , it will ' in the summer pass the meridian after sun rise , apd be equally invisible .
It is seldom that a star can be found within these very narrow limits ; but relatively to a Aquil , it fortunately happens that I Pegasi is so situated as to be very advantageously employed .
Not being yet perfectly satisfied with respect to the stability of the instrument , I have only computed those observations in which each star has been observed on the same day .
In so short an interval as three hours , I cannot conceive any sensible change of position in the telescope can possibly affect the observations .
Notwithstanding this precaution , they are far inferior in exactness to those of M &amp; Cygni .
I can only attribute this to the effect of accidental refraction .
From the table * which accompanies this paper , it appears that 54 observations from the s5th July to g9th December , I817 , divided into four equal series , give the following results .

149 , ot I can discern no appearance of parallax in the above observations ; and indeed I have long considered it as a hopeless task to establish its existence by observations on a star so far from the zenith .
After so many fruitless attempts to establish the existence of sensible parallax , I was much disposed to abandon all farther prosecution of this subject , when my anxiety vas again renewed by the paper lately communicated to the Society by Dr. BRINKLEY .
The arguments and observations which it contains , are such as no doubt require very attentive consideration ; but I think some of Dr. BRINKLEY'S doubts have arisen from my not having myself been sufficiently explicit as to the details of my own observations , and the precautions I have used .
However this may be , it seemed to me more than ever desirable to institute some new process of investigation , to which none of Dr. BRINKLEY'S objections could possibly apply ; and it has occurred to me , that perhaps the observations made with the new transit instrument might be sufficiently exact for this purpose , though taken under very unfavourable circumstances .
This was a question to be easily determined by inspection , and I have the satisfaction to state , that I find the observations of a Aquila , already made , quite sufficient to establish this important point ; namely , that the parallax of this star is either an insensible quantity , or is so extremely small , that it cannot possibly have had any share in producing the discordances observed by Dr. BRINKLEY.* made with a fixed telescope.* Observed Difference rerfl- ; t , &lt; i- , i PI Pl tel oI nn.rl * &lt; r1 1e &lt; Rev.
