Additional Note to the Eleventh Series of Researches on the Tides .
By the Rev. W. WHlEWELL , B.D. F.R.S. , Fellow of Trinity College , Cambridge .
Received February 7 , -Read April 2 , 1840 .
THE tide observations which I recorded and discussed in my eleventh memoir on that subject , were laid before the Royal Society , because , though the different series of observations were both brief and imperfect , the features of the tide phenomena as there exhibited were novel ; and it appeared desirable to put them on record with a view to future comparison with other places .
I have now to notice other observations which I have received from another region , and which display similar features in a still more remarkable manner .
These , with the results of a few other sets of observations , which may , I trust , hereafter be of use , I beg to lay before the Society , as an Appendix to my eleventh memoir on the subject of the Tides .
The principal tide observations which I now bring forward are those for which I am indebted to the Russian Admiral LIUTKE .
These observations were made in 1827 and 1828 by the officers and men of the Seniavine corvette , commanded by the ( then ) Captain LUTKE .
From the account given me of the mode of observing , it appears that they were made with proper apparatus and with great care and perseverance , as is indeed sufficiently shown by the observations themselves .
At one place ( Petropaulofsk in Kamtchatka ) the height of the surface was carefully observed every ten minutes day and night ; and when near its maximum , every two minutes .
And it is proper to remark , that this great care and labour , which would have been superfluous at most places , was necessary in this instance .
If the observations had not been thus continued , they would not have enabled us to detect the very curious laws of the phenomena which I have now to describe .
I shall first state the peculiar features of the tide phenomena shown by these observations ; and I shall aftervwards add such portions of the registers and calculations as seem requisite to confirm and illustrate what I shall state .
1 .
Petropaulofsk , in the Bay of Avatcha , peninsula of Kamtchatka , latitude 530 .
1 N. , longitude 158ยง 44 ' E. Observations made in October 1827 , June 1838 , October and November 1828 .
On laying down these observations , in our usual manner , in curve lines , it appeared ( as at Bassadore , already noticed in this memoir , ) that the high water is affected in its time by a very large diurntal inequality , while the height is only slightly affected by an inequality of that kind .
This diurnal inequality of the time reaches the enormous amount of above four hours ; thus the intervals ( between moon 's transit and high water ) on October 11 and 12 , 1827 , were as follows : 5h 3811 , 1h 39m , 5'1 2011 , Oll 56m ; on June 23 and 24 , 1828 , they were 711 9 , 3h 9 " , 7h 21 " , 2h 51 " ; on October 15 and 16 , 1828 , they were 5h 13m , 2h Om , 6h 71 , 2h 466 " ; showing an alternate increase and diminution to the extent I have mentioned .
The greatest alternate inequalities of the heights of high water during the series of observations which I have mentioned , were something more than a foot .
But when we examine the observations of low water , we find the case marked by additional features , which render it still more curious .
For , in the low waters , the diurnal inequality of the times appears indeed , but is neither so large nor so regular as the inequality of the times of high water ; it amounts at some periods to one hour , but not often to more .
The diurnal inequality of the height of low water , on the other hand , is much larger than that for high water , reaching the amount of three , or even four feet ; and this , in a tide of which the whole irise , from the lowest to the highest , rarely exceeds five feet .
The diurnal inequality depends , as is well known , upon the moon 's declination ; and its maximum and its disappearance have been found , at most places hitherto examined , to follow at a short interval ( one or two days ) the maximumr and the vanishing of the moon 's declination .
If we examine the Petropaulofsk observations with regard to this point , we find that the greatest and most regular of the diurnal inequalities which I have noticed , the inequality of the time of high water and of the height of low water , correspond with the moon 's declination ; they have their maximum when the declination is greatest , whether north or south , and pass from positive to negative on the very day on which the moon crosses the equator .
Using the phrases which have previously been employed on this subject , the epoch of the diurnal inequality is zero , and the effect of the moon 's declination reaches Petropaulofsk without any delay or retardation .
But this view of the laws of the tides at this place , which might otherwise be accepted without difficulty , is extremely perplexed and interfered with by the other parts of the diurnal inequality , the inequality of heights at high water and of times of low water .
For though these inequalities are not so large or so regular as the others , still they are sufficiently marked and steady to allow their laws to be seen beyond doubt .
And it appears , not only that the epoch of these parts of the inequality does not agree with that of the others , but that these two inequalities alternate with the other two , vanishing when the other reach their maxima , and showing their maxima when the others vanish .
This is a very perplexing circumstance ; for we cannot doubt that the diurnal inequality depends upon the moons not moving in the equator ; and therefore , how this inequality should affect the height of high water and the time of low water most , at that period at which the moon is in the equator , it is difficult to conceive .
As the series of observations upon which my inferences are founded are but short ( three series of a few weeks each ) , it imight be doubted perhaps whether they are sufficient 162 to establish so curious a rule as this .
I think no one looking at the observations thrown into the form of culves , will doubt that in them a rule of this Mkind really prevails ; but I quite agree with the opinion , that in order to fix the rule with exactness a larger series of careful observations is requisite .
In order that the reader may judge for himself , I annex the figures given by the observations for June 1828 .
Petropaulofsk Heights .
June , 1828 .

91 10 12 13 J I ) AI shall proceed to point out a few additional inferences which offer themselves as resulting from the Petropaulofsk tidal phenomena , before I proceed to the observations made at other places .
Single-Day Tides.-The tides of Petropaulofsk show more clearly than any that have yet been examined , the manner in which the diurnal inequality may be so large as to lead to the appearance of only one tide in the twenty-four ( lunar ) hours .
This will be very readily seen , if we follow the motion of the surface of the water for a few days , which is done in the accompanying figure .
17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 8 10 / I 12 13 14 The vertical lines in this figure represent the es he heights of the surface , and the horzontal space measures the time , each ( livision being a day .
It will be seen that there are on each day two high waters , excepting the 21st , when the second high water passes over to the 22nd , in consequence of the lunar being larger than the solar day .
The heights of the high waters are alternately greater and less ; as are also , in a still Y2 163 greater degree , the heights of the low waters .
And thus some of the high waters are depressed , and some of the low waters elevated , till there is little vertical distance between the two .
On the 17th of June the rise from low to high water in the afternoon was only eight inches , although the rise in the forenoon had been four feet .
In the same manner , the fall from high to low water in the forenoon of June 22 was only two inches , and in the forenoon of June 23 only one inch , although the intermediate fall in the afternoon of those days was above four feet .
And these movements of the surface in the forenoons of those days , which we have called a fall from high to low water , are in fact more simply conceived as a Imere temporary check in the rise of the water from the preceding low to the succeeding high water .
And accordingly on June 24 the movement plainly assumes this character ; the ascent is checked , but no descent takes place .
In the register of the observations it is stated that " from 6h to 81 the surface remained stationary , so that we may say there was no low water .
" And thus one of the two half-daily tides being obliterated , we have at this period only one tide in the twenty-four hours .
This phenomenon , or an approximation to it , has already come under our notice in the tides of Sincapore , of the Keeling Islands , and of Bassadore ; and has been noticed by others in other places .
It is to be recollected , however , that this reduction of the two half-day tides to a single-day tide takes place only at a particular period of each lunation , depending upon the declination of the moon .
When therefore a traveller has such a phenomenon brought under his notice , he should recollect that by pursuing his tide observations for a few days with assiduity , he will find the single-day tide resolve itself into the usual case of two daily tides .
" The establishment " ceases to be applicable.-The diurnal inequality affects the time of high water at Petropaulofsk to a very large amount , as we have seen ; and hence the interval of moon 's transit and high water , whether taken at the syzygy or at any other time , may vary very much from one tide to another .
I have already noticed cases in which these intervals were alternately Ih and 511 , 2 and 6h , 3h and 7b .
Now this being the case , what do we mean by the Establishment of the place ?
Supposing such observations as those just mentioned to be made at the syzygy , which of the two numbers of hours is to be taken as the establishment , in the common sense of the term ?
There is no ground for preferring either to the other , and therefore we cannot with any propriety deduce the establishment from either .
Perhaps it will be said that we may take the mean of two , or of an even number of successive high waters ; and thus obtain an approximation to the establishment , such as it would be if not affected by the diurnal inequality .
But even if a mean establishment were so obtained , it could not be applied .
Thus if it appeared that the lunitidal interval for the time of syzygy , cleared of diurnal inequality , were five hours , still , as the cycle of thie diurnal inequality is entirely different from the time between syzygy and syzygy , the interval at syzygy may not be affected at all by the inequality , or it may be affected by the greatest positive , or by the greatest negative value .
It 164 may thus be five hours , or seven hours , or three hours .
And this uncertainty deprives the establishment of all utility in such cases as the one before us , except we also take into account the diurnal inequality .
If , after laying down the lunitidal intervals as ordinates , we draw a line cutting off the diurnal inequality , according to the method which we have previously employed , we find that the semimenstrual line gives intervals oscillating between the ( mean ) values of 3h 39 " and 51 25m .
HIence the mean lunitidal interval or corrected establishment ( using terms explained in former memoirs ) is 411 32m : and the maximum amount of the semimenstrual inequality ( positive and negative ) is 53m , and its total variation during a semilunation is 10611 ; which is larger than the variation at most places .
Hence we see of what very wide changes the lunitidal interval at Petropaulofsk is susceptible .
If we take the maximum of the diurnal inequality ( positive or negative ) at two hours , the lunnitidal interval may vary from 1h 39m to 7h 25n ; and thus the constancy of the establishment is quite obliterated .
And even in this statement , we have not taken account of the effects of the parallax of the moon , and the effect of her declination upon the diurnal mean .
Diurnal Tide Wave.-As I have shown in former memoirs , we may represent the usual diurnal inequality at any place as the effect of a tide wave arriving at the shore once a day and superimposed upon the semidiurnal tide wave .
We are naturally led to ask whether such a mode of representation is applicable to the tides now under consideration .
The features which the diurnal inequality exhibits at Petropaulofsk are not , for the most part , inconsistent with such a representation .
Thus , that the inequality should affect high water and low water very differently , is easily explained .
Nor is there any difficulty in accommodating the hypothesis of the diurnal wave to one of the most curious of the laws which we have discovered ; namely to this , that the inequality affects in the largest degree the time of high water and the height of low water .
It is perhaps worth while to show this .
In order to simplify the case as much as possible , I shall state and prove the following proposition .
If the maximum of the diurnal wave coincides with the minimum of the semidiurnal wave , there will be a diurnal inequality of the time of high water , and of the height of low water , depending upon the proportion of the maxima of the two waves ; but there will be no diurnal inequality in the height of high water or in the time of low water .
Let t be any time measured in ( lunar ) half-days from a given high water ; then the height ( above mean water ) of a semidiurnal tide may be represented ( omitting inequalities ) by a cos 2X t. This gives high water when t is 0 , 1 , 2 , or any whole number , and 13 low water when t is , T ' , or the half of any odd number .
On the same supposition a diurnal tide might be irepresented by b cos X t , which is a maximum when t is 0,2 , 4 , and a minimum when t is 1 , 3 , 5 , &amp;c. But since the maximum of the semidiurnal and of the diurnal tide do not necessarily coincide , the latter may be represented 165 more generally by b cos ( z t 3 ) , which , when 3 is a quadrant , becomes 6 sin X t. In this case the maximum of the diurnal wave coincides with the minimumI of the semidiurnal : and the compound wave is a cos 2rt+b sin r t. In this case it is proposed to find the diurnal inequality .
For high and low water we have , by the rule for maxima , 2a sin 2tt+b cos rt= 0 , or b cos rt =4 a sin x t. cos r t. Hence b cos rt= 0 , or sin rt= -aThe former value gives for t the values,2 ' - , &amp;c. , which belong to the time of low water , and show that the time of low water is not altered by the diurnal wave .
The other value gives for ta certain fraction x , and also the numbers 1 x , 2+ x , 3 x , &amp;c. ; these belong to the time of high water , and show that the time of high water is affected by a diurnal inequality , of which the maximum , positive and negative , is x. The height of low water is obtained by substituting , for t , the values - ' , '- , &amp;c. which give the depressions , a 6 , a+ b , a 6 , &amp;c. , showing that the height of low water is affected by a semidiurnal inequality , of which the maximum is b positive and negative .
The height of high water is obtained by substituting , for t , x , 1 x , 2+ x , b2 3 x , all which give the values a cos 2rx+b sin r x , or a+ ~-a ; showing that there is no diurnal inequality of height in the high water .
If the maximum of the diurnal wave do not coincide either with the maximum or the minimum of the semidiurnal , the compound wave will be a cos 2Xt+b cos ( 5r t O3 ) ; and there will be inequalities both of time and of height , both for high and low water .
And the inequalities at high and low water will bear certain proportions depending upon ( and a ; and conversely , if the proportions of the high-water and low-water diurnal inequalities of time and height be known , the quantities 3 and may be found .
But all this is applicable so long only as the inequalities of high and of low water coincide in their cycles , reaching their maxima and vanishing together ; and as we have seen that , instead of doing this , they reach their maxima and vanish alternately , we are compelled to give up ( in this instance ) this mode of representing the diurnal inequality by means of a diurnal wave .
tnder the present aspect of the subject , I do not conceive that we can pursue this examination further with advantage , till we possess a longer series of careful observations of the Petropaulofsk tides .
The singular laws which the tides there follow makes it a matter of interest to science to have these laws still further established 166 and analysed ; the knowledge that the case does thus deserve further inquiry , we owe to the very great exactness and perseverance with which the observations were made by Admiral LUTKE in 1827 and 1828 .

Porit of Novo-Arkhangelsk , Isle of Sitkhce , Norfolk Sound , on the north-west coast of America , latitude 57ยง 2 ' N. , longitude 135ยง 18 ' west of Greenwich .
Observations made in July 1827* .
The Isle of Sitkhce is nearly in the same latitude as Kaimtchatka , on the opposite side of the Northern Pacific , the distance of the two coasts being in that part about 66 degrees of longitude .
Tile Idifferences which have been found to prevail in the phenomena of the tides even in places almost adjacent , leave us without any good ground of expectation that the tiles of these two coasts will be found to resemble each other , even in their general features .
It is found , however , that some of the most curious of the circumstances which mark , the Petropaulofsk tides , appear also in those of Novo-Arkhangelsk .
The Sitkhoe tides exhibit a very great diurnal inequality both in the heights and in the times .
The amount of this inequality at high water reaches an hour ( half an hour positive and negative ) ; at low water it is somewhat less .
The diurnal inequality of the height of high water is two feet and a half ; at low water its maximum effect amounted to five feet , the greatest iise frosm low water to high water being about fifteen feet .
Thus we see that at Sitkhbo , as in Kamtchatka , there is a very large diurnal inequality which affects the time of high water more , and the height less , than those of low water .
The motion of the surface will be in its general features the same in this as in the former case , although it does not appear , so far as the observations before us can show , that one of the two semidiurnal tides is ever obliterated .
I may add , that it appears also , so far as we can judge from a short series of observations , ( a month , with interruptions , ) that the maxiinum and zero of the hig ?
hwater diurnal inequalities alternate with those of low water , which we have already noticed as so perplexing a circumstance at Petropaulofsk .
The diurnal inequality being allowed for , we obtain a semimenstrual inequality of the mean tide at Sitkhoe , which is tolerably regular .
According to our discussion , the greatest and least lunitidal intervals are 12h 10 lO , and 13h 25m from the lunal transit of the preceding half-day the Inean on the corrected establishment being 12h 49m , and the total amount of the sernimenstrual inequality 75m .
Urtder these circumstances we cannot doubt that the tides of Kamtchatka and Sitkhoe are to be explained in the same way , whatever the explanation may be ; and probably the same features extend in some measure over the whole of the North Pacific .
Port de la Coquille , Isle of Ualan , Caroline Archipelago , latitude 5ยง 21 ' N. , longitude 163ยง 5 ' east of Greenwich .
Observations made in December 1827 .
These observations were made for about nineteen days , with interruptions .
They exhibit some of the same features as the two preceding places ; a very large diurnal inequality , both of the heights and times , and both at high and low water .
In this case the inequality of the heights appears to be greatest for high water .
Also its maximum appears to alternate with the maximum of the inequality for low water ; but the series of observations is too short and incomplete to determine this point with certainty .
Having allowed for the diurnal inequality , we obtain a very large semimenstrual inequality .
The lunitidal intervals appear to oscillate from 3h 30m to 6h 16m .
These very wide changes may throw suspicion upon the exactness of the observations ; yet the changes are so regular and continuous , as greatly to remove such suspicions .
According to these results the mean lunitidal interval or corrected establishment is 4h 5311 .
4 .
Port Lloyd , Isle Bonine-Sinma , latitude 27ยง 5 ' N. , longitude 142 51 west of GIreenwich .
Observations made May 1828 .
Port Lloyd has a very large diurnal inequality , affecting both the times and the heights ; it affects most the high-water times and the low-water heights .
In the inequality of the heights , the maxima for high water and low water appear to alternate ; in the times , this is more obscure ; but we cannot expect clear evidence on this head , the observations including only nine days .
For the saine reason it is impossible to state with any precision the establishment of this place .
The maximum lunitidal interval ( cleared of diurnal inequality ) is 8 " 42m ; and from the course of the curve which represents the observations , it appears certain that the semnimenstrual inequality of times is large .
If this inequality be two hours , the mean lunitidal interval will be 7h 42m .
The observations sent by Admiral LUTKE contained an account of the Establishment of several other places in the North Pacific ; but , as I have already stated , the term establishment becomes in the highest degree vague , and almost unmeaning , when applied to seas in which the phenomena of the tides are such as are described in the present paper .
P.S. From the account of Admiral FREYCINET'S voyage , it appears that at several places in the North Pacific , the tides , as observed in that expedition , exhibit features similar to those here noticed .
