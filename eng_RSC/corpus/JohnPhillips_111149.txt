" Experiments made at York ( Lat. 53ยง 58 ' N. ) on the Deviation of the Plane of Vibration of a Pendulum from the meridional and other vertical planes .
" By John Phillips , Esq. , F.R.S. Received June 3 , 1851 .
The following is the author 's account of these experiments .
The experiments , of which the following is a notice , were made partly in the nortli-western Tower of the Minster , and partly in a room of my residence .
The latter attempts have only within a few days acquired sufficient method and consistency to deserve reporting ; nor have the trials in the Minster been uniformly successful .
Mr. Thomas Cooke , al able optician of York , began the experiments in the Minster .
On the 30th of April , Mr. Gray and myself observed the vibration of his pendulun , and found it so accurate as to justify the belief that it might not only indicate the direction , but measure the angular value of the deviation of the pendulum plane from the meridian .
Computing this value for an hour to be 12 ?
+ , we watched the result and found the are passed over to be 13 ? .
When this observation was recorded , the pendulum was supposed to have commenced its vibrations on a north and south line ; but that was an error ; it was really swung from east to west .
In repeating this experiment , I have been more anxious to vary the conditions , in a few arranged observations , than to accurnulate many similar results .
We have observed in four azimuthal planes ; one of our balls weighed eight pounds , the other twenty pounds : one was an oblate , the other a prolate spheroid ; suspension was effected at first by thoroughly softened catgut , afterwards by untwisted silk : we have compared small and large arcs , counted the periodical times of vibration in three planes , noted the direction of motion in the elliptic path of the pendulum , and estimated the length of its minor axis .
We have recorded results when no ellipticity was remarked , and others in which its injurious effect was manifest .
The pendulum performs one complete vibration in 8 ' : from which its length is deduced =52t+ feet .
The chord of the arc of vibration was usually taken at 14 , feet , but was on some trials reduced to 7 feet .
The graduated circle was 12 feet in diameter .
Great care was used in starting the ball , which did not rotate , but presented the same face to the same quarter of the room , in whatever direction it was swung .
The apartment was subject to air currents ; the floor from which the suspension was effected though strong was large ; and there was no method of securing exact verticality in the iron tube which carried the flexible catgut or silk .
From one or all of these causes it happened that ellipticity in the path was noticed in almost every experiment , and it might exist in all , and be unobserved if the minor axis did not exceed one-fourth of an inch .
After abandoning several trials in which the minor axis was observed to increase rapidly , it was thought desirable to determine by experiment the effect of this elliptical swing on the angular movement of the pendulum plane ( see exp .

1 'mean 12 0+.For obvious reasons the force maintaining the pendulum plane being greatest in the beginning of the sweep ( when the versed sine of the arc is greatest ) , and the action of the elliptical swing then least the deviations in the first portions of the hour appear likely to be more correct than the average of the whole hour .
The suspension was now changed from softened catgut to untwisted silk .
From some disarrangement connected with this change it happened that ellipticities were generated in every experiment , and nearly all were abandoned as useless on account of the great dimensions of the ellipse , which , growing as the arc of vibration lessened , sometimes acquired a minor axis of above three inches .
Whatever the direction of the movement in the ellipse , its effect was to rotate the pendulum plane in the same direction ; thus augmenting the deviation when the motion in the ellipse was to the right , and diminishing it when it was to the left .
In most azimuths the elliptical motion was to the left .
In the following example its effect was followed for an hour to the right .

When this experiment was recorded I had but slight expectation of being able to apply a correction to results which were so largely influenced by elliptical motion .
While making it my attention was mainly directed to the rather difficult task of correctly estimating the minor axis of the ellipse ( the most important of the elements for determining its rotatory effect ) , and I only twice recorded the length of the major axis , viz. at its origin , 14 feet , and , after the expiration of rather more than half an hour , 7 feet .
The Astronomer Royal , to whom the experiment in the state here set down was communicated , having kindly furnished me with an appropriate formula , I have resumed the consideration of what had appeared to me an unmanageable result .
In this formula 8x b-=n ) a is the length of the pendulum , b and c the semiaxes of the ellipse , n the number of complete double vibrations of the pendulum during the period of one rotation due to the ellipse .
In this case eight such vibrations being performed in one minute , =-minutes of time to one rotation of the ellipse .

... in 1029 or 17 15 hours , the ellipse having its major axis varying from 14 to 7 feet , and its minor axis from 0 to 34 inches .
Taking b and c at arithmetical means of their extreme values ( in the case of the major axis this mean is something too great , and in the case of the minor axis something too small ) , we have ,81 _ = ... :.52. .

Experiment in my House .
After many failures the apparatus became tolerably efficient , with a pendulum of 68*7 inches , as deduced from the vibrations , 22'64 in a minute .
The balls used were a prolate spheroid weighing 6 ?
lbs. , and a globe weighing only l-lb .
I have obtained the best results with the smaller weight .
The suspensions have been silk , gutta percha , and various contrivances of points and sockets of agate , brass and steel .
The best results have been obtained with gutta percha , and sockets of agate and steel .
The arc mostly used was from 16 to 20 inches .
The experiments , were seldom continued beyond half an hour .
By that time the chord of vibration was reduced to about 7 or 8 inches , and the errors of experiment were thought likely to be too great , with so short a radius , if longer continued .
The ball , in whatever direction swung , presents the same face to the same side , of the room. .

It should , however , be tried in a glass case , and probably in vacuo .
