By the Learned John Wallis S. T. D. &amp; R. S. Soc. 1 .
THat the Air ( and the like of any other Medium ' ) doth considerably give refiltance to Bodies moved in it , ( and doth thereby abate their Celerity and Force : ) is generally admitted .
And Experience doth attest it : For otherwise , a Cannon Bullet projected Horizontally , should ( supposing the Celerity and Force undiminished ) strike as hard against a perpendicular Wall , erected at a great distance , as near at hand : which we find it doth not .
2 .
But at what Rate , or in what Proportion , such resistance is ; and ( consequently , at what Rate the Celerity and Force is continually diminished ) seems not to have been so well examined .
Whence it is , that the Motion of a Project ( secluding this Consideration ) is commonly reputed to describe a Parabolick Line ; as arising from an Uniform or equal Celerity in the Line of Projection , and a Celerity uniformly accelerated in the Line of Descent : which two so compounded , do create a Parabola .
3 .
In order to the computation hereof ; I first premise this Lemma , ( as the most rational that doth occur for my first footing , ) That ( supposing other things equal ) the resistance is proportional to the Celerity .
For in a double Celerity , there is to be removed ( in the same time ) twice as much Air , ( which is a double Impediment ) in a treble , thrice as much ; and so in other Proportions .
4 .
Suppose we then the Force impressed ( and consequently the Celerity , if there were no resistance ) as 1 ; the resistance as r. ( which must be less than the Force , or else the Force would not prevail over the Impediment , to create a Motion .
) And therefore the effective Force at a first Moment , is to be reputed as 1-r : That is , so much as the Force impressed , is more than the Impediment or Resistance .
5 .
Be it as 1r to 1 ; so 1 to m. ( which m is therefore greater than 1 .
) 6 .
And therefore the effective Force ( and consequently the Celerity ) as to a first Moment , is to be 1/ m of what it would be , had there been no resistance .
7 .
This 1/ m is also the remaining Force after such first Moment ; and this remaining Force is ( for the same Reason ) to be proportionally abated as to a second Moment : that is we are to take 1/ m thereof , that is 1/ m m of the impressed Force .
And for a third Moment ( at equal distance of time ) 1/ m m m ; for a fourth 1/ m 4 ; and so onward infinitely .
8 .
Because the length dispatched ( in equal times ) is proportional to the Celerities ; the Lines of Motion ( answering to those equal Times)are to be as 1/ m , 1/ m 2 , 1/ m 3 , 1/ m 4 , &amp;c. of what they would have been , in the same Times , had there been no resistance .
9 .
This therefore is a Geometrical Progression ; and ( because of m greater than 1 ) continually decreasing .
10 .
This decreasing Progression infinitely continued ( determining in the same point of Rest , where the Motion is supposed to expire ) is yet of a Finite Magnitude ; and equal to 1/ m-1 of what it would have been in so much Time , if there had been no resistance .
As is demonstrated in my Algebra , Chap. 95 .
Prop. 8 .
For ( as I have elsewhere demonstrated ) the Sum or Aggregate of a Geometrical Progression is VR A/ R 1 ( supposing V the greatest term , A the least , and R the common multiplyer .
) That is V R/ R A/ R A/ R 1 .
Now in the present Case , ( supposing the Progression infinitely continued ) the least term A , becomes infinitely small , or = 0 .
And consequentlyA/ R 1 doth also vanish , and thereby the Aggregate becomes =V R/ R 1 .
That is ( as will appear by dividing R 1)VR(V + V/ R , V/ RR , &amp;c. VR by R 1 ; ) V+ V/ R + V/ R R+V/ R 3+ &amp;c. =V R/ R 1 ; ( supposing the Progression to begin at V= 1 .
) That is ( dividing all by R , that so the Progression may begin at V/ R=1/ m:)V/ R-1=V/ R+V/ R R +V/ R 3+ &amp;c. That is , in our present Case ( because of V=1 , &amp; R=m : ) 1/ m + 1/ mm + 1/ m 3 &amp;c. = 1/ m-1 .
That is , ( putting n=m 1 ) 1/ n of what it would have been if there had been no resistance .
VR-V/ + V +V-V/ R/ +V/ R +V/ R-V/ RR/ +V/ RR &amp;c. 11 .
This infinite Progression is fitly expressed by an ordinate in the exterior Hyperbola , parallel to one of the Asymptotes ; and the several Member of that , by the several Members of this , cut in continual Proportion .
As is there demonstrated at Prop. 15 .
For let S H , ( vid .
Fig. III .
) be an Hyperbola between the Asymptotes A B , AF : And let the ordinate DH ( in the exterior Hyperbola , parallel to A F , ) represent the impressed force undiminished ; or the Line to be described in such time , by a Celerity answerable to such undiminished force .
And let BS ( a like ordinate ) be 1/ m thereof ; which therefore , being less than DH ( as being equal to a Part of it ) will be further than it from A F. In AB ( which I put = 1 ) let Bd be such a Part thereof , as is BS of D H. Now because ( as is well known ) all the inscribed Parellelograms , in the exterior Hyperbola , A S , A H , &amp;c. are equal ; and therefore their sides reciprocal : Therefore as Ad=1 1/ m ( supposing Bd to be taken , from B toward A , ) to AB= 1 , ( or as m1 to m : ) so is BS = 1/ m D H , to d h , which m 1 ) 1 ( 1/ m + 1/ mm + 1/ m 3+ &amp;c. is therefore equal to 1/ m 1 of D H ; that is ( as will appear by dividing 1 , by m 1 , ) to 1/ m + 1/ m m + 1/ m 3 &amp;c. of D H. Or if Bd be taken beyond B ; then as Ad= 1+ 1/ m , to AB= 1 , or as m+1 to m , so is 1/ m DH to d h , which is therefore equal to 1/ m +1D H ; that is ( as will appear by like dividing of 1 by m+ 1 ; ) = to 1/ m 1/ m m+ 1/ m 3 &amp;c. of D H. 1 1/ m/ + 1/ m +~/ + 1/ m m + 1/ m m 1/ m m m/ &amp;c. + 1/ m mm 12 .
Let such ordinate d h , or ( equal to it in the Asymptote ) A F , be so divided in L , M , N &amp;c. ( by perpendiculars cutting the Hyperbola in l , m , n , &amp;c. ) as that F L , LM MN be as 1/ m , 1/ m m , 1/ m 3 &amp;c. That is , so continually decreasing , as that each antecedent be to its consequent , as 1 to 1/ m , of as m to 1 .
See Fig. IV 13 .
This is done by taking A F , A L , A N , &amp;c. in such proportion .
For , of continual proportionals the differences are also continually proportional , and in the same proportion .
For let A , B , C , D , &amp;c. be such proportionals ; and their differences a , b , c , &amp;c. That is AB= a , BC= b , CD= c , &amp;c. Then , because A , B , C , D , &amp;c. are in continual proport : That is A. B : : B. C : : C. D : : &amp;c. And dividing A B. B : : B C. C : : C D. D : : &amp;c. That is a. B : : b. C : : d. D : : &amp;c. And alternly a. b. c. &amp;c. : : B. C. D. &amp;c. : : A. B. C. &amp;c. That is , in continual proportion as A to B , or as m to I. 14 .
This being done ; the Hyperbolick spaces Fl , Lm , M n ; &amp;c. are equal .
As is demonstrated by Gregory SanVincent ; and as such is commonly admitted .
15 .
So that F l , L m , M n , &amp;c. may fitly represent equal times , in which are dispatched unequal lengths , represented by F L , L M , M N , &amp;c. 16 .
And because they are in number infinite ( though equal to a finite Magnitude ) the duration is infinite : And consequently the impressed force , and motion thence arising , never to be wholly extinguished ( without some further impediment ) but perpetually approaching to A , in the nature of Asymptotes .
17 .
The spaces F l , F m , F n , &amp;c. are therefore as Logarithms ( in Arithmetical progression increasing ) answering to the lines A F , A L , A M , &amp;c. ; or to F L , L M , M N , &amp;c. in Geometrical progression decreasing , 18 .
Because F L , L M , M N , &amp;c. are as 1/ m , 1/ m m , 1/ m 3 , &amp; c ( infinitely ) terminated at A ; therefore ( by ~ 10 ) their Aggregate FA or d h , is to D H , ( so much length as would have been dispatched , in the same time , by such impressed force undiminished ) as 1 to m1= n. 19 .
If therefore we take , as 1 to n , so AF to D H ; this will represent the length to be dispatched , in the same time , by such undiminished force .
20 .
And if such DH be supposed to be divided into equal parts innumerable ( and therefore infinitely small ; ) these answer to those ( as many ) parts unequal in F A , 21 .
But , what is the proportion of r to 1 , or ( which depends on it ) of 1r to 1 , or 1 to m ; remains to be inquired by experiment .
22 .
If the progression be not infinitely continued ; but end ( suppose ) at N , and its least term be A=M N : then , out of V/ R 1= 1/ m + 1/ m m+ 1/ m 3 &amp;c. is to be subducted A/ R 1 ( as at ~ 10 ) that is ( as by division will appear ) A/ R + A/ R 2+ A/ R 3 &amp;c. That is ( in our present case ) a/ m + a/ m m+ a/ m 3 &amp;c. And so the Aggregate will be 1 a/ m +1 a/ m m +1 a/ m 3 &amp;c. =1 a/ n. And thus as to the line of Projection , in which ( secluding the resistance ) the motion is reputed uniform ; dispatching equal lengths in equal times .
Consider we next the line of Descent .
23 .
In the Descent of Heavy Bodies , it is supposed , that to each moment of time , there is superadded a new Impulse of Gravity to what was before : And each of these , secluding the consideration of the Airs resistance , to proceed equally ( from their several beginnings ) through the succeeding moments .
As ( in the erect lines ) 1111 &amp;c. 111 &amp; c , 11 &amp;c. 1 &amp;c. and so con1 tinually as in the line of of Projection .
11 24 .
Hence arises ( in the transverse lines ) 111 for the first moment , for the second 1+ 1 , 1111 for the third 1+1+ 1 , and so forth , in A &amp;c. rithmetical progression : As are the Ordinates in a Triangle , at equal distance .
25 .
And such are the continual increments of the Diameter , or of the ordinates in the exterior Parabola , answering to the interior Ordinates , or Segments of the Tangent gent , equally increasing .
As is known , and commonly admitted .
26 .
If we take-in the consideration of the Airs resistance ; we are then for each of these equal progressions , to substitute a decreasing progression Geometrical ; in like manner ( and for the same reasons ) as in the line of Projection .
27 .
Hence arises , for the first mo1/ m meant 1/ m ; for the second 1/ m + 1/ m 2 ; for the 1/ m 2 1/ m third 1/ m + 1/ m 2+ 1/ m 3 &amp;c. And such is 1/ m 3 1/ m 2 1/ m therefore the Descent of a heavy Body falling by its own weight .
The seve1/ m 4 1/ m 3 1/ m 2 1/ m ral impulses of Gravity being supposed equal .
28 .
That is ( in the figure of ~ 12 ) as F L , F M , F N , &amp; c , in the line of Descent , answering to F L , L M , M N , &amp;c. in the line of Projection .
29 .
But though the Progressions for the line of Projection , are like to each of those many in the line of Descent : it is not to be thence inferred , that therefore 1/ m in the one , is equal to 1/ m in the other : But in the line of Projection ( suppose ) 1/ m f ( such a part of the force impressed , and a celerity answerable : ) in the line of Descent , 1/ m g ( such a part of the Impulse of Gravity .
) 30 .
Those for the line of Descent ( of the same Body ) are all equal , each to other : Because g ( the new Impulse of Gravity ) in each moment is supposed to be the same .
31 .
But what is the proportion of f to g ( that of the force impressed , to the Impulse of Gravity in each Body ) remains to be enquired by Experiment .
32 .
This proportion being found as to one known force ; the same is thence known as to any other force ( who 's proportion to this is given ) in the same uniform Medium .
33 .
And this being known as to one Medium ; the same is thence known as to any other Medium , the proportion of who 's resistance to that of this is known .
34 .
If a heavy body be projected downward in a pendicular line ; it descends therefore at the rate 1/ m , 1/ mm , 1/ m 3 , &amp;c. of f ( the impressed force ) increased by 1/ m , 1/ m + 1/ m 2 , 1/ m + 1/ m 2+ 1/ m 3 &amp;c. of g the impulse of Gravity : ( by ~ 7 .
&amp; ~ 27 .
) Because both forces are here united .
35 .
If in a perpendicular projection upwards ; it ascends in the rate of the former , abated by that of the latter .
Because here the impulse of Gravity is contrary to the force impressed .
36 .
When therefore this latter ( continually increasing ) becomes equal to that former ( continually decreasing ) it then ceaseth to ascend ; and doth thenceforth descend at the rate wherein the latter continually exceeds the former .
37 .
In an Horizontal or Oblique projection : If to a Tangent who 's increments are as F L , L M , M N , &amp; c ; that is as 1/ m f , &amp;c. be fitted Ordinates ( at a given angle ) who 's increments are as F L , F M , F N , &amp;c. that is as 1/ m g , &amp; c : The Curve answering to the compound of these Motions , is that wherein the Project is is to move .
38 .
This Curve ( being hitherto without a name ) may be called Linea Projectorum ; the line of Projects , or things projected ; which resembles a Parabola deformed .
39 .
The Celerity and Tendency , as to each point of this line , is determined by a Tangent at that Point .
40 .
And that against which it makes the greatest stroke or percussion , is that which ( at that point ) is at right angles to that Tangent .
41 .
If the Projection ( at ~ 27 .
) be not infinitely continued , but terminate ( suppose ) at N , so that the last term in the first Column or Series erect be a ; and consequently in the second , m a ; in the third , mm a , &amp;c. ( each Series having one term fewer than that before it:)then(for the same reasons as at ~ 22 .
) the Aggregates of the several Columns ( or erect Series ) will be 1 a/ n , 1m a/ n , 1mm a/ n , and so forth , till ( the multiple of a becoming = 1 ) the progression expire .
42 .
Now all the abatements here , a , m a , mm a , &amp;c. are the same with the terms of the first Column taken backward .
For a is the last , ma the next before it ; and so of the rest .
43 .
And the Aggregate of all the Numerators is so many times 1 as is the number of terms ( suppose t , ) wanting the first Column ; that is t1 a/ n , or nt 1+ a/ n ; &amp; this again divided by the common denominator n , becomes nt 1+ a/ n n. And therefore nt 1+ a/ n n g , is the line of descent by its own Gravity .
44 .
If therefore this be added to a projecting force downward in a perpendicular ; or subducted from such projecting force upward ; that is , to or from 1 a/ n f : The Descent in the first case will be 1 a/ n f+ nt 1+ / n n g ; and the Ascent in the other case 1 a/ n f nt 1+ a/ n n g. And in this latter case , when the ablative part becomes equal to the positive part , the Ascent is at the highest : and thenceforth ( the ablative part exceeding the positive ) it will descend .
45 .
In an Horizontal or Oblique projection ; having taken 1 a/ n f in the line of Projection , and thence ( at the Angle given ) nt 1+ a/ n ng in the line of Descent ; the point in the Curve answering to these , is the place of the Project answering to that moment .
46 .
I am aware of some Objections to be made , whether to some points of the Process , or to some of the Suppositions .
But I saw not well how to wave it , without making the Computation much more perplexed .
And in a matter so nice , and which must depend upon Physical Observations , t will be hard to attain such accuracy as not to stand in need of some allowances .
47 .
Somewhat might have been further added to direct the Experiments suggested at ~ 21 .
and 31 .
But that may be done at leisure , after deliberation had , which way to attempt the Experiment .
48 .
The like is to be said of the different resistance which different Bodies may meet with in the same Medium , according to their different Gravities ( extensively or intensively considered ) and their different figures and Positions in Motion .
Whereof we have hitherto taken no account ; but supposed them , as to all these , to be alike and equal .
Post-script .
49 .
The computation in ~ 41 , 42 , 43 , may ( if that be also desired ) be thus represented by Lines and Spaces .
The Ablatives a , m a , mm a , &amp;c. ( being the same with the first Column taken backward ) are fitly represented by the segments of NF ( beginning at N ) in Figure IV .
and V. and therefore by Parallelograms on these Bases , assuming the common hight of F h , or N Q : the Aggregate of which is N h , or F Q. And , so many times 1 , by so many equal spaces , on the same Bases , between the same Parallels terminated at the Hyperbola : The Aggregate of which is hFN Qn .
From whence if we subduct the Aggregate of Ablatives F Q ; the remaining trilinear h Qn , represents the Descent .
50 .
If to this of Gravity , be joined a projecting Force ; which is to the impulse of Gravity as hK to hF ( be it greater , less , or equal ) taken in the same line : the same parallels determine proportional Parallelograms , whose Aggregate is K Q. 51 .
And therefore if this be a Perpendicular Projection downwards ; then hKkn ( the sum of this with the former ) represents the Descent .
52 .
If it be a Perpendicular upwards ; then the difference of these two represents the Motion : which so long as KQ is the greater , is Ascendent : but Descendent when hQn becomes greater : and it is then at the highest when they be equal .
53 .
If the Projection be not in the same Perpendicular , ( but Horizontal , or Oblique ) then KQ represents the Tangent of the Curve ; and hQn the Ordinates to that Tangent , at the given Angle .
54 .
But the Computation before given I take to be of better use than this representation in Figure .
Because in such Mathematical enquiries , I choose to separate ( as much as may be ) what purely concerns Proportions ; and consider it abstractly from lines or other matter wherewith it is encumbered .
As to the question proposed ; whether the resistance of the Medium do not always take off such a proportional part of the force moving through it , as is the Specific Gravity of the Medium to that of the Body moved in it : ( for , if so , it will save us the trouble of Observation .
) I think this can by no means be admitted .
For there be many other things of consideration herein , beside the Inten tensive Gravity ( or , as some call it , the Specific Gravity ) of the Medium .
A viscous Medium shall more resist , than one more fluid , though of like Intensive Gravity .
And a sharp Arrow shall bore his way more easily through the Medium , than a blunt headed Bolt , though of equal weight , and like intensive Gravity .
And the same Pyramid with the Point , than with the Base forward .
And many other like varieties , intended in my ~ 48 .
But this I think may be admitted , namely , That different Mediums , equally liquid , ( and other circumstances alike , ) do in such proportion resist , as is their Intensive Gravity .
Because there is , in such Proportion , a heavier object to be removed , by the same Force .
Which is one of the things to which ~ 33 .
refers .
And again : The heavier Project once in motion , ( being equally swift , and all other circumstances alike ) moves through the same Medium in such proportion more strongly , as is its Intensive Gravity .
For now the Force is in such proportion greater , for the removal of the same resistance .
And this part of what my ~ 32 .
insinuates .
But where there is a complication of these considerations one with another , and with many other circumstances whereof each is severally to be considered : there must be respect had to all of them .
