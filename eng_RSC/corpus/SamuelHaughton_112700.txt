In a former communication to the Royal Society on this subject ( Proceedings , 20th June 1867 ) , I endeavoured to establish the two following principles : I. That the force of a muscle is proportional to the area of its cross section .
II .
That the force of a muscle is proportional to the cross section of the tendon that conveys its influence to a distant point .
The first of these principles is true under all circumstances , but the second requires to be modified somewhat in its statement .
If the conditions as to friction of the tendons that convey the action of the muscles to a distant point be the same , then the force of the muscles will be proportional to the cross sections of the tendons ; but if the tendons be subjected to different amounts of friction , then the areas of their cross sections will cease to be proportional to the forces of the muscles , as represented by the areas of their cross sections .
In my former paper ( No. I. ) , I selected , in illustration of principle II .
, the long flexor tendons of the toes of the hea and other struthious birds , and showed that the cross sections of the muscles and tendons bore , approximately , a constant ratio to each other .
Now , in the Struthionide , the conditions as to friction of the long flexor tendons of the toes are similar although different in each species , and hence it was easy to prove that the ratios of the cross sections of the muscles and tendons were nearly constant .
When , however , muscles and tendons , variously conditioned as to friction , are compared together , the constancy of the ratio of their cross sections disappears , and undergoes a variation depending on the friction to which both muscles and tendons are exposed .
In order to ascertain the proportion of the cross section ( or force ) of a muscle to the cross section ( or strength ) of its tendon in the human subject , I made the following observations on the right arm and hand of a well-developed male subject in the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland , in March 1868 .
I first ascertained the specific gravities of the muscles and tendons , with the following results ; 33 , Muscles .

0182 0o0254 72 ' From the preceding Table , it appears that the ratio of the cross section of the muscles to that of the tendons may range from 7 to 28 , or be four times greater in one case than another .
We may also see in general , that the tendons exposed to the greatest amount of friction have the smallest coefficients of cross section .
Thus the radial tendon of the biceps has a coefficient of 28 2 , while the scapular tendon , which undergoes the friction of passing over the head of the humerus , has a coefficient of 180 .
Again , the Ext. oss .

poll .
, whose tendon winds round the radius , and has the duty imposed upon it of binding down the tendons of the radial extensors of the wrist , has the coefficient of 7'7 , as compared with 26'2 and 18'4 , the coefficients of the comparatively free tendons of these extensors .
As it might be objected that the relative cross sections of muscle and tendon , in a human subject that died a natural death , might be exceptional in character , from wasting during the last illness , I determined to test the question by experiment , and accordingly selected a fine Pyrenean Mastiff for the purpose , which I killed by strychnia , and dissected immediately after death , with the following results , which were obtained , as before , by noting the specific gravities of the muscles and tendons , and by weighing a measured length of each : Cross sections of Muscles and Tendons in a Pyrenean Mastiff and ratios of same .

The following observations , made upon a Wallaby Kangaroo , confirm in a general way the preceding results : Cross sections of Muscles and Tendons in a Wallaby Kangaroo , and ratios of same .

This surplusage , however , cannot be supposed to be large , if the principle of economy of material in nature be admitted .
