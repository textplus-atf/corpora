( Abstract .
) The author describes this paper as one of the class which gives the epitomized results of long series of voluminous observations and laborious calculations , of which the fundamental details have been 1863 .
] 529 printed in works specially devoted to these subjects .
It exhibits in curves the diurnal inequalities of terrestrial magnetism , as obtained by the use of instruments essentially the same , through the whole period of seventeen years , during the last ten years of which the magnetic indications have been automatically recorded by photographic self-registration , on a system which has been continued to the present time , and is still to be continued .
From the last months of 1840 to the end of 1847 , the observations were made by eye , every two hours .
From the beginning of 1848 , for the declination and horizontal force magnetometers , and from the beginning of 1849 , for the vertical force magnetometer , the magnetic indications are recorded by Mr. Brooke 's photographic apparatus .
In preparing the reductions of the magnetic records from 1848 to 1857 ( which are printed in the " Results of Magnetical and Meteorological Observations for 1859 , " bound in the volume of 'Greenwich Observations , ' 1859 , and also issued separately ) , the days of unusual magnetic disturbance had been separated from the rest , and the reductions applied to the mass so diminished .
For unity of plan , it appeared expedient to follow the same course for the reductions from 1841 to 1847 .
In consequence of this , the numbers which are used here differ in some cases by small quantities from those printed in the ' Greenwich Magnetical Observations from 1841 to 1847 .
' The numbers in the reductions from 1848 to 1857 are adopted without change .
The author remarks that , taking the number of omitted days as a rough measure of the amount of magnetic disturbance , there is no appearance of decennial cycle in their recurrence , and no distinct relation to the magnitude of diurnal changes .
The author then proceeds to the description of the curves .
The first four sheets contain the curves in which the horizontal abscissa represents the declination at each hour as compared with the mean for the twenty-four hours and the vertical ordinate represents the horizontal force at each hour as compared with the mean for the twenty-four hours .
On the different sheets the days are differently grouped , thus:-On sheet I. all the observations at each nominal hour throughout the year are combined ; this sheet contains the separate curves for 1841 , 1842 , 1843 , 1844 , 1845 , 1846 , 1847 .
On sheet II .
similar curves are formed for 1848 , 1849 , 1850 , 1851 , 530 1852 , 1853 , 1854 , 1855 , 1856 , 1857 .
On sheet III .
all the observations at each nominal hour through all the months January from 1841 to 1847 are combined to form the January curve ; all those through the months February to form the February curve , and so on .
On sheet IV .
similar month-curves are formed from the period 1848 to 1857 .
It is remarked that the origin of coordinates necessarily represents the mean declination and mean horizontal force in each month .
The author then points out that the means for each month are themselves subject to an annual inequality , which can be ascertained with little difficulty .
The values of these inequalities are exhibited , for declination and horizontal force , separately for the period 18411847 and for the period 1848-1857 ; those in the first period far exceed in magnitude those in the second ( as holds also with regard to all the diurnal inequalities ) .
If we wished to exhibit the hourly state of magnetism , as referred to the mean state given by the supposition of uniform secular change of normal magnetism , we ought to apply these quantities with sign changed , to the origin of coordinates in each curve , in order to form a new origin of coordinates .
For the year-curves , the numbers destroy each other , and no new origin of coordinates is produced ; for the month-curves , however , they shift the origin materially .
The author does not perceive that any facility for theoretical reference or other advantage is gained by this step .
On examining the year-curves , it is seen that from 1841 to 1848 their magnitude very slowly increases , with a small change of form , but from 1848 to 1857 their magnitude very rapidly diminishes , with a great change of form .
Some great cosmical change seems to have come upon the earth , particularly affecting terrestrial magnetism .
On comparing these year-curves with the month-curves , especially with those for the period 1848-1857 , it appears that the change of the year-curves from 1848 to 1857 nearly resembles that of the month-curves from summer to winter ; and the author points out as a possible step to a physical explanation of the change from 1848 to 1857 , that the magnetic action of the sun upon the earth 's southern hemisphere may have remained nearly unaltered , while that on the northern hemisphere may have undergone a great diminution .
The author then alludes to the curves representing the hourly 1863 .
] 531 state of vertical force , as referred to the mean on each day .
The force is here represented by a simple ordinate .
The grouping is made by years and by months in the same manner as for the curves already mentioned .
The month-curves of the two periods ( 18411847 and 1848-1857 ) differ , in the magnitude and change of magnitude of the ordinates , and in the place and change of place of node .
The year-curves of the two periods have some very remarkable differences .
From 1847 to 1849 the magnitude of the ordinates increases sensibly ; from 1849 to 1850 still more ; it then remains nearly stationary .
In 1846 the descending node is at 11h nearly ; in 1847 it is at 9h nearly ; in 1849 at 7h nearly ; in 1850 at 5h ; in 1851 at 4h ; and there it continues with little alteration .
It is important to observe that , though the instrument was changed in 1848 , the change in the place of the node did not then occur suddenly ; it had begun with the old instrument , and continued to advance gradually for several years with the new instrument .
The author states that he had verified the correctness of the node in the first period from other observations , but he had not succeeded in finding observations corresponding in date with those of the latter period .
The paper is followed by eight sheets of curves , as follows : I. Diurnal Curves of combination of Declination and Horizontal Force .
