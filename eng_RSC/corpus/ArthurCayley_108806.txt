Skew Surfaces , otherwise Scrolls .
By ARTHUR CAYLEY , F.RS .
Received February 3 , -Read March 5 , 1863 .
IT may be convenient to mention at the outset that , in the paper " On the Theory of Skew Surfaces"e , I pointed out that upon any skew surface of the order n there is a singular ( or nodal ) curve meeting each generating line in ( n.-2 ) points , and that the class of the circumscribed cone ( or , what is the same thing , the class of the surface ) is equal to the order q of the surface .
In the paper " On a Class of Ruled Surfaces"f , Dr. SALMON considered the surface generated by a line which meets three curves of the orders m , n , p respectively : such surface is there shown to be of the order =2mnp ; and it is noticed that there are upon it a certain number of double right lines ( nodal generators ) ; to determine the number of these , it was necessary to consider the skew surface generated by a line meeting a given right line and a given curve of the order m twice ; and the order of such surface is found to be =-=m(m-1)+h , where h is the number of apparent double points of the curve .
The theory is somewhat further developed in Dr. SALMON'S memoir 1 " On the Degree of a Surface reciprocal to a given one"$ , where certain minor limits are given for the orders of the nodal curves on the skew surface generated by a line meeting a given right line and two curves of the orders mn and n respectively , and on that generated by a line meeting a given right line and a curve of the order m twice .
And in the same memoir the author considers the skew surface generated by a line the equations whereof are ( a,..)t , 1)"=0 ( a',..)t , 1)="O , where a,. .

And the same theories are reproduced in the ' Treatise on the Analytic Geometry of Three Dimensions ' ? .
I will also , though it is less closely connected with the subject of the present memoir , refer to a paper by M. CiASLES , C " Description des Courbes a double courbure de tous les ordres sir les surfaces reglees du troisieme et du quatrieme ordre"lj .
The present memoir ( in the composition of which I have been assisted by a correspondence with Dr. SALMON ) contains a further development of the theory of the skew surfaces generated by a line which meets a given curve or curves : viz. I consider , 1st , the surface generated by a line which meets each of three given curves of the orders m , n , p respectively ; 2nd , the surface generated by a line which meets a given curve of the order m twice , and a given curve of the order n once ; 3rd , the surface which meets * Cambridge and Dublin Math.

a given curve of the order n three times ; or , as it is very convenient to express it , I consider the skew surfaces , or say the " c Scrolls , " S(m , n , p ) , S(m2 , n ) , S(m3 ) .
The chief results are embodied in the Table given after this introduction , at the commencement of the memoir .
It is to be noticed that I attend throughout to the general theory , not considering otherwise than incidentally the effect of any singularity in the system of the given curves , or in the given curves separately : the memoir contains however some remarks as to what are the singularities material to a complete theory ; and , in particular as regards the surface S(m3 ) , I am thus led to mention an entirely new kindof singularity of a curve in space-viz .
such a curve has in general a determinate number of " lines through four points " ( lines which meet the curve in four points ) ; it may happen that , of the lines through three points which can be drawn through any point whatever of the curve , a certain number will unite together and form a line through four ( or more ) points , the number of the lines through four points ( or through a greater number of points ) so becoming infinite .
Notation and Table of Results , Articles 1 to 10 .
1 .
In the present memoir a letter such as m denotes the order of a curve in space .
It is for the most part assumed that the curve has no actual double points or stationary points , and the corresponding letter M denotes the class of the curve taken negatively and divided by 2 ; that is , if h be the number of apparent double points , then M= --[n]2+h : here and elsewhere [ m]2 , &amp;c. denote factorials , viz. [ 1n]2=mn(m-1 ) , [ in]3=mr(m-l)(m-2 ) , &amp;c. It is to be noticed that for the system of two.curves in , n ' , if h , h ' represent the number of apparent double points of the two curves respectively , then for the system the number of apparent double points is ==:mi'+h+h , and the corresponding value of M is therefore --[n+in'2+qnm'+h+h ' , which is =[n]2+h-[']2+h ' , which is =M+M ' .
2 .
The use of the combinations ( n , n , p , q ) , ( m2 , n , p ) , &amp;c. hardly requires explanation ; it may however be noticed that G(mn , n , p , q ) denoting the lines which meet the curves m , n , p , g ( that is , curves of these orders ) each of them once , G(n2 , n , p ) will denote the lines which meet the curve mn twice and the curves n andp each of them once ; and so in all similar cases .
3 .
The letters G , S , ND , NG , NR , NT ( read Generators , Scroll , Nodal Director , Nodal Generator , Nodal Residue , and Nodal Total ) are in the nature of functional symbols , used ( according to the context ) to denote geometrical forms , or else the orders of these forms .
Thus G(m , n , pv , q ) denotes either the lines meeting the curves m , n , p , q each of them once , or else it denotes the order of such system of lines , that is , the number of lines .
And so S(n , n , p ) denotes the Skew Surface or Scroll generated by a line which meets the curves m , n , p each once , or else it denotes the order of such surface .
4 .
G(in , n p , p ) : the signification is explained above .
5 .
S(n , nz , p ) : the signification has just been explained ; but as the surfaces S(m , n , p ) , 454 S(m2 , n ) , S(m3 ) are in fact the subject of the present memoir , I give the explanation in full for each of them , viz. S(Mn , n , p ) is the surface generated by a line which meets the curves m , n , p each once ; 8(m2 , n ) is the surface generated by a line which meets the curve m twice and the curve n once ; S(m3 ) the surface generated by the line which meets the curve m thrice .
As already mentioned , these surfaces and their orders are represented by the same symbols respectively .
6 .
ND(m , n , p ) .
The directrix curves m , n , p of the scroll S(m , n , p ) are nodal ( multiple ) curves on the surface , viz. m is an np-tuple curve , and so for n and p. Reckoning each curve according to its multiplicity , viz. the curve m being reckoned l-[np]2 times , or as of the order m. _-[p]2 , and so for the curves n andp , the aggregate , or sum of the orders , gives the Nodal Director ND(m , n , p ) .
7 .
NG(m , ^ , p ) .
The scroll S(m , n , p ) has the nodal generating lines G(m2 , n , p ) , G(m , n2 , p ) , G(m , n , )p2 ) .
Each of these is a mere double line , to be reckoned once only , and we have thus the Nodal Generator NG(m , n , p)= G(m2 , n , p ) + G(m , , n2 , p)+ G(m , 9 , p2 ) .
But to take another example , the scroll S(m2 , n ) has the nodal generating lines G(qn3 , n ) , each of which is a triple line to be reckoned |s[3]2 , that is , three times , and also the nodal generating lines G(m2 , n2 ) , each of them a mere double line to be reckoned once only ; whence here NG(m2 , n)=3G(m3 , n)+G(rn2 , n2 ) .
And so for the scroll S(m3 ) , this has the nodal generating lines G(m4 ) , each of them a quadruple line to be reckoned ?
[ 4]2 , that is , six times ; or we have NG(mn3)=6G(m4 ) .
8 .
NR(m , n , p ) .
The scroll S(m , n , p ) has besides the directrix curves m , n , p or Nodal Director , and the nodal generating lines or Nodal Generator , a remaining nodal curve or Nodal Residue , the locus of the intersections of two non-coincident generating lines meeting in a point not situate on any one of the directrix curves .
This Nodal Residue , as well for the scroll S(m , n , p ) as for the scrolls S(m2 , n ) and S(m3 ) respectively , is a mere double curve to be reckoned once only ; and such curve or its order is denoted by NR , viz. for the scroll S(m , n , p ) , the Nodal Residue is NR(m , n , p ) .
9 .
NT(m , n , p ) .
The Nodal Director , Nodal Generator , and Nodal Residue of the scroll S(m , n , p ) form together the Nodal Total NT(m , z , p ) , that is , we have NT(m , n , p)=ND(m , n , p)+NG(m , n , ,p)+NR(m , n , p ) ; and similarly for the scrolls S(m2 , n ) and S(m ) .

ND(m , n , p).-Taking any point on the curve m , this is the vertex of two cones passing through the curves n , p respectively ; the cones are of the orders n , p respectively , and they intersect therefore in znp lines , which are the generating lines through the point on the curve m ; hence this curve is an njp-tuple line on the scroll S(m , n , p ) , and we have thus the term mn .

Taking next a point on the curve n , this is the vertex of a cone of the order in through the curve mn ; such cone has ( h= ) [ ln]2+M double lines , which are the generatilg lines through the point on the curve n ; hence this curve is a ( -[Ln]2+M)tuple line on the surface , and we have thus the term uz .

n. Preparatory remarks in regard to the Gformunlw , the hypertriadic singutlarities of a curve in space , Articles 14 to 22 .
14 .
It is to be remarked that the generating line of any one of the scrolls S(m , n , p ) , S(m2 , n ) , S(m3 ) satisfies three conditions ; and that it cannot in anywise happen that one of these conditions is implied in the other two .
Thus , for instance , as regards the scroll S(mn , n , p ) if the curves m , n are given , and we take the entire series of lines meeting each of these curves , these lines form a double series of lines , all of them passing of course through the curves m , n , but not all of them passing through any other curve whatever ; that is , there is no curve p such that every line passing through the curves m and n passes also through the curve p. And the like as regards the scrolls S(m2 , n ) and S(m3 ) .
15 .
But ( in contrast to this ) if the three conditions are satisfied , it may very well happen that a fourth condition is satisfied ipso facto .
To see how this is , imagine a curve q on the scroll S(mn , n , p ) , or , to meet an objection which might be raised , say a curve q the complete intersection of the scroll S(m , n , p ) by a plane or any other surface .
Every line whatever which meets the curves nm , n , p is a generating line of the scroll S(m , n , p ) , and as such will meet the curve q ; that is , in the case in question , G(m , n , p , q ) , the lines which meet the curves m , n , ,p , q , are the entire series of generating lines of the scroll S(m , n , p ) , and they are thus infinite in number ; so that in such case the question does not arise of finding the number of the lines G(m , n , p , q ) .
The like remarks apply to the lines G(m2 , np2 ) , G(m2 , n2 ) , G(m3 , n ) , and G(m4 ) ; but I will develope them somewhat more particularly as regards the lines G(m4 ) .
16 .
Given a curve m , then ( as in fact mentioned in the investigation for ND(m3 ) ) through any point whatever of the curve there can be drawn ( h-m+2 )[mJ2+m-2+M lines meeting the curve in two other points , or say [ m]2+m-2 +M lines through three points .
But in generalUno one of these lines meets the curve in a fourth point ; that is , we cannot through every point of the curve m draw a line through four points ; there are , however , on the curve ma certain number ( =4G(m4 ) ) of points through which can be drawn a line through four points , or line G(m4 ) .
17 .
But the curve m may be such that through every point of the curve there passes a line through four points .
In fact , assume any skew surface or scroll whatever , and upon this surface a curve meeting each generating line in four points ( e. g. the intersection of the scroll by a quartic surface ) .
Taking the curve in question for the curve m , then it is clear that through every point of this curve there passes a line ( the generating line of the assumed scroll ) which is a line through four points , or line G(m4 ) .
4S8 It is to be noticed , moreover , that if we take on the curve m any point whatever , then of the [ mn]2+rn-2+M lines through three points which can be drawn through this point , three will unite together in the generating line of the assumed scroll ( for if O be the point on the curve m , and 1 , 2 , 3 the other points in which the generating line of the assumed scroll meets the curve m , then such generating line unites the three lines 012 , 013 , 023 , each of them a line through three points ) ; and there will be besides 1[qn]2+mn-5+M mere lines through three points .
The line through four points generates the assumed scroll taken ( [ 3]2 ) 3 times , or considered as three coincident scrolls ; the remaining lines generate a scroll S'(m3 ) , which is such that the curve m is on this scroll a ( [ nm]2+rn--5+M)tuple line ; the assumed scroll three times and the scroll S'(m3 ) make up the entire scroll S(m3 ) derived from the curve m , or say S(m3)= 3 ( assumed scroll ) +S'(m3 ) .
19 .
The case just considered is that of a curve m such that through every point of it there passes a line through four points counting as ( 23]]2 = ) 3 lines through three points , and that all the other lines through three points are mere lines through three points .
But it is clear that we may in like manner have a line through _p points counting as 1[p --l ] lines through three points ; and more generally if p , q , ... are numbers all different and not &lt; 3 , and if 2['mo^~]^^++,1]2 + i[ 1 ]2+ ... .
then we may have a curve m such that through every point of it there pass Xc lines each through p points and counting as 1[_p 1]2 lines , P lines each through q points and counting as 1[q-_ 1]2 lines , &amp;c. ... : the case 3 gives of course a lines each through three points and counting as a single line .
It is to be added that , in the case just referred to , the CG lines will generate a scroll S'(m3 ) taken 6L[p]3 times , the P lines will generate a scroll S"I(m3 ) taken I[q]3 times , &amp;c. , which scrolls together make up the scroll S(m3 ) , or say S(qn3 ) =_[p]3 S(M3 ) + _[q]3 .
S"(m3 ) + &amp;c. ; it may however happen that , e. g. of the oc lines , any set or sets or even each line will generate a distinct scroll or scrolls-that is , that the scroll S'(m3 ) will itself break up into scrolls of inferior orders .
20 .
A good illustration is afforded by taking for the curve ma curve on the hyperboloid or quadric scroll ; such curves divide themselves into species ; viz. we have say the ( p , q ) curve on the hyperboloid , a curve of the order p+q meeting each generating line of the one kind in p points , and each generating line of the other kind in q points ; here m=p+ .
, ( h= _[p]2+_ L 12 , and.-.)M= _p .
Assuming for the moment that p , q are each of them not less than 3 , it is clear that the lines through three points which can be drawn through any point of the curve are the generating line of the one kind counting as [ _-1I]2 lines through three points , * It is hardly necessary to remark that ( reality being disregarded ) any quadric surface whatever is a hyperboloid or quadric scroll .
459 and the generating line of the other kind counting as l-[q-1]2 lines through three points , so that 1[m]2+r2n2+M= =2[p -]2+[1]2 .
The complete scroll S(qn3 ) is made up of the hyperboloid considered as generated by the generating lines of the one kind taken *[p]3 times , and the hyperboloid considered as generated by the generating lines of the other kind taken I[q]3 times ( so that there is in this case the speciality that the surfaces S'(m3 ) , S"(qn3 ) are in fact the same surface ) .
And hence we have s(me ) = 2(61 [ p]3+_ 6 ] )=)-W+.3 [ S +3 21 .
I notice also the case of a system of m lines .
Taking here a point on one of the lines , the ( h-qn+2=)[qm]'-n-+2 lines through three points which can be drawn through this point are the -2[n1]2 lines which can be drawn meeting a pair of the other ( mn-1 ) lines , and besides this the line itself counting as one line through three points ( 2nm-'112+1 = [ m]2-m+ 2 ) ; the line itself , thus counting as a single line through three points , is not to be reckoned as a line through four or more points drawn through the point in question , that is , the system is not to be regarded as a curve through every point of which there passes a line through four points : each of the lines is nevertheless to be counted as a single line through four points , and ( since there are besides two lines which may be drawn meeting each four of the In lines ) the total number of lines through four points is =-m]2n4+m .
22 .
In the following investigations for G(im , 5n , p , q ) , &amp;c. , the foregoing special cases are excluded from consideration ; it may however be right to notice how it is that the formule obtained are inapplicable to these special cases ; for instance , as will immediately be seen , the number of the lines G(gmq , n , ) , q ) is obtained as the number of intersections of the surface S(m , n , p ) by the curve , = 22mnp x =2 2nnpq ; but if the curve q lie on the surface S(mn , n1 , p ) , then G(nw , n , p , q ) is no longer = 2mnnpq .

G(m , , lp , q).-(Considering the scroll S(n , n , p ) generated by a line which meets each of the curves m , n , 1p , this meets the curve q in q S(w , n , p ) points through each of which there passes a line G(m , n , p , g ) ; that is , we have G(m , n , p , q)=g S(n , u , p ) .
But from this equation we have S(mn , n , p)=G(1 , n , n , p)=p S(1 , mn , i ) ; thence also S(1 , mn , n)=G(l , 1 , qn , n2)=n S(1 , 1 , n ) , and S(1 , 1 , n)==G(l , 1 , 1 , n)-en S(l , 1 , 1 ) ; S(1 , 1 , 1 ) CG(1 , 1 , 1 , 1)-2 , 460 since 2 is the number of lines which can be drawn meeting each of four given right lines .
Hence ultimately G(m , n , p , g)_wlmnpG(l , 1,1 , 1 )=2mnpg .
24 .
G(m , n , p).- In a precisely similar manner we find G(m.2 n , p)==^pG(1 , 1 , I , )= in'l , m3 ) , and it is the same question to find G(1 , 1 , m2 ) and to find S(1 , m2 ) .
I investigate G(1 , 1 , m2 ) by considering the particular case where the curve m is a plane curve having n double points .
The plane of the curve meets the two lines 1 , 1 in two points , and the line through these two points meets each of the lines 1 , 1 , and meets the curve in m points ; combining the last-mentioned m points two and two together , the line in question is to be considered as _[{m]2 coincident lines , each of them meeting the lines 1 , 1 , and also meeting the curve m twice .
But we may also through any double point of the curve draw a line meeting each of the lines 1 , 1 ; such line , inasmuch as it passes through a double point , meets the curve twice ; and we have i such lines .
This gives for the case in question G(1 , 1 , ma)=h+I[mn ] ; or , introducing in the place of h the quantity M(=_A-[n[]2 ) , so that h=-I[m]2+M , we have G(1 , 1 , m')=[n]2+M .
And , to the double points of the plane curve , there correspond in the general case the apparent double points of the curve m. Admitting the correctness of the result just.obtained , we then have G(W2 n , =p)=n([m ] 2+M ) .
25 .
G(mW , W).-I investigate the value by a process similar to that employed for G(1 , 1 , mn ) .
Suppose that the curves m and n are plane curves having respectively A and k double points ; then the line of intersection of the two planes meets the curve mn in m points , and the curve n in n points ; or , combining in every manner the m points two and two together , and the n points two and two together , ; the line in question is to be considered as [ in].in]'[ coincident lines , each meeting the curves m , n , each curve , twice .
There are besides the hk lines joining each double point of the curve m with each double point of the curve n. This gives in all i[mn]2[n]+hk lines ; or , ngh=i[M]2+M , k=2[n]2+N , the number is =i=M[m1n]2+M .
[ n]2+N'N[m]2+MN ; which is the value of G(m2 , n2 ) given by the investigation .
26 .
G(m ' , n).-We have G(m\ , n)=nG(i , WS)= S(W ) , and it is in fact the same question to find G(l , ne3 ) and to find S(m ' ) .
I assume for the present that the value is =i[m3+M(m-2 ) ; and we then have G(mn n)=n(i3+M(m-2 ) ) Before going further , I observe that there are certain functional conditions which must be satisfied by the G formulae .
Thus if the curve m be replaced by the system of the two curves n , n ' , instead of M we have M+M ' .
Let G(m ) denote any one of the functions G(m , n , y , q ) , G(m , n p ) , G(m , n3 ) , we must have G(m+m ' ) =G(m ) +G(n')Similarly , if G(nw2 ) denote either of the functions G(m2 , n , p ) , G(n2 , n2 ) , we must have G(m+m')2=G(rn)+G(m , m ' ) +G(m'2 ) ; and so if G(m3 ) stand for G(m3 , n ) , then G(nm+')3= G(ne3)+ G(2 , i')+G(n , m !
2 ) +G(mn3 ) ; and finally G(m+m')4=G(4 ) +G(m3 , nm')+ G(m2 , m'2)+ G(m , imn ) +G(nm4 ) .
28 .
The first three equations may be at once verified by means of the above given values of the G functions .
But conversely , at least on the assumption that G(m ) , G(n2 ) , &amp;c. , in so far as they respectively depend on the curve m , are functions of m and M only , we may , by the solution of the functional equations , obtain the values of the G functions .
It is to be observed that the first equation is of the form &lt; ( m+n')= P(m)+P(r ) , X the general solution whereof is m=c.am+S3M ; then second equation , supposing that G ( m , nm ' ) is known the third equation , supposing that G(n , in ' ) and G(m , m'2 ) are known-and the fourth equation , supposing that G(m3 , m ' ) , G(m2 , '2 ) , G(m , m3 ) are known , are respectively of the form ( m+ m')=pmn+ nm'+funct .
( m , in ' ) ; and hence if a particular solution be given , the general solution is -p9()= Particular Solution+om+P3M .
The values of the constants must in each case be determined by special considerations .
29 .
The value of G(m , n , p , q ) was obtained strictly ; that of G(n2 , n , p ) was reduced to depend on G(1 , 1 , m2 ) , and that of G(m3 , n ) on G(1 , 3n ) .
I apply therefore the functional equations to the confirmation of the values of G(1 , 1 , n2 ) , G(n2 , 2 ) , and G(1 , i3 ) , and to the determination of the value of G(m4 ) .
30 .
First , if G(n2 ) denote G(1 , 1 , n2 ) , then G((m , mn ) denotes G(1 , 1 , mn , in ' ) , which is =22mwm ' ; hence G(n+ an')2G(W2 ) -G(in2)=2mmn , n which is satisfied by G(m)=[mn]2 .
This gives G(1 , 1 , m +2)=[]2+rnm+SpM .
But if the curve m be a system of n lines ( m=m , M=0 ) , then G(1 , 1 , m2)=[mn ] ; and 462 again , if the curve in be a conic ( m=2 , M=-1 ) , then G(1 , 1 , m2)=1 .
This gives a=O , P3=1 , and therefore G1 , 1 , mn)=[rnM2+M .
31 .
Next , if G(mn ) denoteG(m2 , n2 ) , then G(m , in ' ) denotes G(m , n ' , n2 ) , which is =mm'([n]2+N ) .
The functional equation is. .
, G(rn+m')2-G(m2)-G(mr'2)=re=2([n]2+N ) , which is satisfied by G ; ( }n)=JtO"1 +2([]+N ) .
Hence we have G(r2 , w2 ) =I[r12]2([2'+N ) +oam+3M , where a , ( 3 are functions of n , .
N ; and observing that G(n2 , $n2 ) must be symmetrical in regard to the curves m and n , it is easy to see that we may write G(mn2 , j2)= L [ m ] ?
j2+M.W 2f]2+N .
[ ]2+aMrn+3(mN+nM)+yMN , where a , 3 , y are absolute constants .
To determine them , if the curve m be a pair of lines ( m=2 , M-0 ) , then G(m2 , A2)=G(1 , 1 , n2)=[n]2+N ; and if each of the curves m , n be a conic ( m=2 , M= -1 , rn=2 , N=-1 ) , then G(m2 , Wn2)=1 .
These tcases give C6=(3-0 , y=1 , and therefore G(m2 , SX2)= [ m]2[]j2+M .
{ i[l]2 + N. I[m]2+MN .
32 .
Again , G(mn ) standing for G(1 , m3 ) , then G(m2 , m ' ) and G(m , mI2 ) will stand for G(1 , imn , n ) and G(l , m , m'2 ) , the values whereof are mn'([]2+M ) and m([m']+M ' ) respectively .
We thus have G(n+m')3G(m3)G(n'3)=n'([m ] + M)+m([n']t+M ' ) , a solution of which is G(rn)=*[rn]3+mM .
Hence we have G(1 , m')=*i[]3n+mM+Uom+PM .
Suppose first that the curve m is a system of lines ( m=m , M=Oj ) , then G(l , mn)=[m]3 ; and next that the curve m is a cubic in space or skew cubic ( m= 3 , M= -2 ) , then G(1 , mw)=O , since a line can meet the curve in two points only .
We thus find as=O , 3 =-2 , and thence G(l , 3)= S3 M(M 2 ) .
33 .
Hence , substituting for G(m3 , n ' ) , G(m2 , mn2 ) , G(m , miI ) their values im'(*[m]+M(n-22 ) ) , .
[ M]2[nm]2 ?
+M .
[ nm'j]2+M'.I iEm]n+MM ' , and m(i[m']+M'(m'-2 ) ) 3ztR 2- ; respectively , we find G(m+m)4G(m ) -G(m4 ) m'(ImW]3+M(m-2 ) ) +2[M]2[Mrn2+M .
k['1]2+M ' .
i[mw2+MM ' + m(*[mn]3+M'(nm-2 ) ) , and thence , obtaining first a particular solution , the general solution is G(m4)=9L[m]4+M( n]22m)+M2 .
+m+M .
34 .
To determine the constants , suppose first that the curve m is a system of lines ( m=n , M=O ) , we must have G(n4)=1[i]4m+ , and thence , '=0 .
Next , if the curve m be a conic ( m=2 , M=1 ) , we must have G(m4)=O ; and this gives f3== , and consequently G(m4)=La[m1]4++M({[m]2-2m+ ' ' )+M2. .
The NGformulca , Article 35 .

The NG formulae are now at once obtained , viz. we have NG(m , n , p)=G(nm , n , p)+G(m , n2 , p)+G(m , n , p2 ) , NG(m2 , n ) = 3G(m3 , n ) +G(m2 , n2 ) , NG(mW ) =6G(m3 ) , which give the values in the Table .
The S formuzl , particular cases , Articles 36 to 40 .
36 .
The S formulae have in fact been obtained in the investigation of the G formulae : we have S(m , n , p)=2mnp , S(2 , n ) =n([m]2 +M ) , S(m3 ) 3[mJ]3 +M(m 2 ) .
37 .
In confirmation of the formula S(1 , m2)=L[m2+M , it is to be remarked that if we take through the line I an arbitrary plane , this meets the curve m in m points , and joining these two and two together we have I[m]2 lines , each of them meeting the curve m twice and also meeting the line 1 ; that is , the lines in question are generating lines of the scroll S(1 , i2 ) .
The line I is , as already mentioned , an ( h=)([mrn]2+M)tuple line on the scroll ; the section by the arbitrary plane is therefore the line 1 taken ( !
[ m]2+M ) times , together with the before-mentioned 1[m]2 lines ; that is , the order of the surface is [ mi2+M , as it should be .
This is in fact the mode in which the order of the scroll S(1 , m2 ) was originally obtained by Dr. SALMON .
38 .
As regards the formula S(m3)=-im]'+M(m-2 ) , suppose that the curve m is a ( p , q ) curve on the hyperboloid , we have as before m =.p+g , M= -pq , and the formula becomes which is S(im)=4[p +q]3-p ( p+qI-2 % ) 464 viz. -as already remarked , the surface is in this case the hyperboloid taken U[P]3+6i]$ times .
39 .
It is to .
be noticed also that if the curve m be a system of lines ( m=m , M=O ) , then the formula gives which is right , since in this case the scroll is made up of the [ ml]3 hyperboloids , generated each of them by a line which meets three out of the m lines .
In the case of a 'curve m , which is such that the coordinates of any point of the curve are proportional to rational and integral functions of the order m of an arbitrary parameter 0 , or say the case of a unicursal curve of the order m , we have ( h1=[m-1]2 and..)M=-(m--i ) , and the formula gives s(m , )=[ml]3 , for a direct investigation of which seepost , Annex No. 1 .
40 .
In the case of a curve m , which is the complete intersection of two surfaces of the ordersp and g respectively , or say a complete ( p Xq ) intersection , we have im=p , ( h=pq(p-1)(q-l ) and **)M=-jpg(p+q-2 ) ; and we find S(mS)=-p(pq( P-2)(2pq-3p-3 + 4 ) =P(P 2)(2P-3as+ 4 ) if aj=pq , f3=p+q .
The mode of obtaining this result by a direct investigation was pointed out to me by Dr. SALMON ; see post , Annex No. 2 .
Particular ccses of the formula for G(m4 ) , Articles 41 &amp; 42 .
41 .
In the case of a ( p , q ) curve on the hyperboloid , putting as before m=p+q , M= -pq , we find G(r4)=i-)I[p+]4+P+q-p( [ p+ 2 -2(p+qj + 2 !
7 which is =2([p]4+ [ C]1)-2g[p-l ] -2p[.q-ljs , vanishing if p , q are neither of them greater than 3 : this is as it should be , since there is then no line which meets the curve four times .
The curves for which the condition is satisfied are ( 1 , 1 ) the conic , ( 1 , 2 ) the cubic , ( 2 , 2 ) the quadriquadric , ( 1 , 3 ) the excubo-quartic , ( 2 , 3 ) the excubo-quintic ( viz. the quintic curve , which is the partial intersection of a quadric surface and a cubic surface having a line in common ) , and ( 3 , 3 ) the quadri-cubic , or complete intersection of a quadric surface and a cubic surface .
If either p or q exceeds 3 , we have the case of a curve through every point whereof there can be drawn a line or lines throughfour or more points , and the formula is inapplicable .
465 In the case of a complete ( p Xq ) intersection , we have as before m--=pq , M= -p(p+ --2 ) , and the formula for G(m4 ) becomes G(nm4)= -66c+144 4+I(3W2+18a-26 ) 2 +p2 _-6a t+3 2 , 1a formula the direct verification whereof is due to Dr. SALMON ; see ypSt , Annex No. 3 .
The formulac for NR(1 , m , n ) and NR(1 , mn ) , Articles 43 to 46 .
43 .
NR(1 , m , n).-Through the line 1 take any plane meeting the curve n in m points and the curve n in n points ; then if m , , m2 be any two of the mn points , and n1 , n2 any two of the n points , the lines mnn , and m2n , are generating lines of the scroll S(1 , m , n ) , and these lines intersect in a point which belongs to the Nodal Residue NR ; and in like manner the lines m1n2 and m2n1 are generating lines of the scroll , and they intersect on a point of NR ; we have thus points on NR , that is , the arbitrary plane through the line 1 cuts NR in l [ m][n]2 points , But the plane also cuts NR in certain points lying on the line 1 , and if the number of these be ( a ) , then NR(1 , im , n)=-[mI[n +a .
44 .
The points ( a ) are included among the cuspidal points on the line 1 .
Taking for a moment x0 , y=O for the equations of the line 1 ( which , as we have seen , is a mn-tuple line on the scroll ) , the equation of the scroll is of the form ( A , ... x , y)"=nO , where A , ... are functions of the coordinates of the degree mn .
The entire number of cuspidal points on the line 1 is thus =2[mn]2 ; but these include different kinds of cuspidal points , viz. we have 2[mon]2=2a+2ac+2ca'+R , if ( a ) be the number of points in which the line 1 meets NR , 5 as 11 ? ? ? ? . ?

And then observing that we have a =.S(m2 , n)=n([m]2+M ) , c'=S(m , n2)=m([n]2 +N ) , 466 these values give 2a+2a ' +R =2n m]2+2m[n]2 , and we have a=- !

NR(1 , m2).--Through the line 1 take any arbitrary plane meeting the curve m in m points ; if ml , m2 , i3 , m4 be any four of these , then the lines m , m , and m , m4 are generating lines of the scroll S(1 , m2 ) , and their intersection is a point of the nodal residue NR ; but in like manner the lines m1m , and m , m^ are generating lines of the scroll , and their intersection is a point of NR ; and so the lines m^m4 and m , ^ , are generating lines of the scroll , and their intersection is a point of NR .
We have thus ( 3 x *[rMn]4)*[M1]4 points of NH on the arbitrary plane through the line 1 .
But there are besides the points of NR which lie on the line 1 ; and if the number of these be ( a ) , then -NR(1 , m)=-W[m]4+a .
46 .
The points ( a ) are included among the cuspidal points of the scroll lying on the line 1 .
Supposing for a moment that x=O , y=0O are the equations of the line 1 , then this line being a ( I[m']2+M)tuple line on the scroll , the equation of the scroll is of the form ( A , ... 3 , y)KI]'s+M=O , where A , ... are functions of the coordinates of the degree -l[m]2 : the number of cuspidal points on the line 1 is thus ( 2 .

Writing S(m ) to denote either of the scrolls S(m , n , p ) , S(i , n2 ) , and supposing that in place of the curve m we have the aggregate of the two curves mn , m ' ; then the scroll S(m+m ' ) breaks up into the scrolls Sm , Sm ' , and the intersection of these is part of the nodal total NT(nm+m ) ; that is , we have NT(m+nW')=NT(n4)+NT(m')+S(m ) .

( M2 )+ ( m , m')+ ( m'2 ) , ( p(m+n')3= p(m ' ) + ( M2 , ) +p(rM rn2 ) -P-P ( m'3 ) ; and if in the second equation p(mn , m ' ) and in the third equation p(m2 , in ' ) and p(m , rn'2 ) are regarded as known , these are all of them of the form f(m+m')-f(m)-f'(m')=Funct .
( m , n ' ) ; so that , a particular solution being obtained , the general solution isf(m)= Particular Solution +m 3n+PM , at least on the assumption that f(m ) , in so far as it depends on the curve m , is a function of in and M only .
51 .
First , if p(nz ) stands for p(m , n , p ) , we obtain ( mn , n , p ) )= am+i3M , or observing that P(m , n , p ) must be symmetrical in regard to the curves m , n , and p , we may write pn(m n , n , ) = amnnp +P(Mizp +Nmp+PmPn ) + y(mNP +nMP+pMN ) + MNP , and then NT(m , n , p)=--S2-S+I ( rn , n , p ) =2mnnp(mnp-1 ) +p(m , , p ) .
But forp=l this should reduce itself to the known value of NT(1 , m , n ) ; this gives a=O , / 3=1 , y=O ; we in fact have , as will be shown , post , Art .
55 , ==0 ; and hence NT(m , n , p)=_S2-S +(Mp +Nmp+Pmn ) = 2[mnp]2 +-(Mnp + Nmp + Pmn ) .
52 .
Next , if p(m2 ) stand for ( p(m2 , n ) , then p(m , m ' ) stands for p(mn i ' , m ) , which is =Nmmr'+n(mM'+rn'M ) , and the equation is p(m + m')2 p(m2 ) ( m'2 ) =Nmn ' + n(nM'+ m'M ) .
A particular solution is &lt; p(m2)= [ M]2N+snmM , and we have therefore ( p(m2 , n)= [ m2]2N+nrnM+rnm+P3M ; or observing that p(m2 , n ) considered as a function of n , satisfies the equation ( n+nn ' ) = p(n)+ ( n ' ) , and is therefore a linear function of n and N , we may write p(n2 , ) 1)=[9n]2N+nmM+zanm+InM+ymN+WMN ; we then have NT(Mn2 , ja)=IS2_S+p(M2 , n ) , where S=S(m2 , )=-n([m]+M ) .
And then putting n=1 , and comparing with the known value of NT(1 , m2 ) , we find ca=0 , 3= --1 .
It will be shown , post , Art .
55 , that ry= 0 , =0 ; and we have therefore ( nm % n)=Xwr(m3)+N(-2[m]2+M)7 and thence NT(m , n)= 1S2-_ S+p(m2 , n ) =-n m]4+2[m]3+M([ 2J2+ )_ +M2.1 * ) + [ n]2(1-[]4+2[m]3 + [ m]2+M[M]2+ M2 .

Next for ( mn3 ) , substituting for p(m2 , ' ) and &lt; p(m , 12 ) their values , we have p(m+')(m_ -(3)-m(n3 ) =mM ( m -5 ) + M'([mn]2 +M ) +MM'(d-_A)+M(-[ !
]2+M ' ) which is satisfied by ( m=3)=M( [ m]2_5 )i+M2 , and the general value then is ( 3 ) = M( I [ M]2-_5 )+M2+am+PM , and we have NT(m3)= -S2-S + p(m3 ) , where S=S(e3)= I [ fm]3 +M(m-2 ) .
54 .
Taking for the curve m the ( p , q ) curve on the hyperboloid ( m=p + g , M= -pl ) , S(m3 ) becomes the hyperboloid taken k times , if k= [ p]3+ [ q]3 ; that is , S(n3 ) =2k , and NT(m3)=4 .
[ ]2 + ( m3 ) ; p(i3 ) must vanish if p and g are each not greater than 3 , this implies a= 3 , ( 3=11 , for with these values the formula gives @(0= -M f-i]+X[-]3 ) .
55 .
I assume the correctness of the value p(m3)= 3m + M([In]2+ &gt; )+M2 so obtained , as being in fact verified by means of the six several curves ( 1 , I ) , ( 1 , 2 ) , ( 1 , 3 ) , ( 2 , 2 ) , ( 2 , 3 ) , ( 3 , 3 ) ; and I remark that if the foregoing value of p(m , n , p ) had been increased by 6aCMNP , then it would have been necessary to increase the value of ( mn2 , n ) by 3%M2N , and that of p(m8 ) by aM3 ; and moreover that if the foregoing value of p(m2 , n ) had been increased by ymN+SMN , then it would have been necessary to increase the value of p(m3 ) by ymM + ; M2 ; this is easily seen by writing down the values 'p(n3 ) =ymM +SM2 + aM3 0(w2 ) , rT)^tmM ' + ; MM'+ 3aM2M ' , { ( m , r'2)=ymn'M + ; MM'+ 3c MM'2 , p(*13 ) =yM'M+ M/ '2 + MM13 470 the sum of which is = y(mn+mw)(M+M/ ) +w(M+M')2+a(M+M')3 , the corresponding term of ( ( m3 ) ; hence the value of ( p(n3 ) being correct without the foregoing addition , we must have y=0 , ==0 , ==0O ; which confirms the foregoing values of ( ( m , , p ) , p(nm2 , n ) .
56 .
The equation NT(Mn3)= 1S2 -S+ ( m3 ) gives NT(m3 ) =2S2-+3n+M([n]2-An+ll)+M2 = -i [ Mm]IM M+ 3M.-M(*[m]4+tn]3+ I+ [ n]2-in+ 13 ) +M 2([m]2-2n+ 3 ) .

Intersections of a generating line with the Nodal Total , Articles 59 to 63 .
59 .
We may for the scrolls S(1 , m , n ) and S(1 , m2 ) verify the theorem that each generating line meets the Nodal Total in a number of points=S-2 .
In fact for the scroll S(1 , n , n ) , the directrix curves are respectively multiple curves of the orders inn , n , mn , and a generating line meets each of these in a single point , counting for the three curves respectively as mn-1 , n-1 , and m1 points respectively .
Moreover the construction ( ante , Art .
43 ) for the Nodal Residue NR(1 , n , n ) shows that a generating line meets this curve in ( m-l)(n-1 ) points ; and since the curve is merely a double curve , these count each as a single point ; and the generating line does not meet the Nodal Generator NG(1 , in , n ) .
The number of intersections therefore is ore lS ~ min+(m-l)+(n-i ) +(m-l)(n-l ) , which is =2mn-2 , =8S-2 .
60 .
Similarly for the scroll S(1 , n2 ) ; the directrix curves are multiple curves , viz. the line 1 is a ( _I[m]2+M)tuple curve , and the curve In a ( m-l)tuple curve ; the 3s 2 471 generating line meets the former in a single point , counting as ]nm12+M -1 points , and the latter in two points , each counting as ( mn-2 ) points .
The construction ( ante , Art .
45 ) for the Nodal Residue NR(1 , m2 ) shows that the generating line meets this curve in i[my -2]2 points ; and since the curve is merely a double curve , these couint each as a single point .
Finally , the generating line does not meet the Nodal Generator NG(1 , in2 ) .
The number of intersections thus is 2[int]2-1+Mi+2(in-. .
2 ) +[m2]2 , which is [ m]l2-2+M , =S-2 .
In the remaining cases we may use the theorem to find the number of points in which the generating line meets the Nodal Residue .
Using 11 as the symbol for the points in question ( FI(m , n , p ) for the scroll S(n , n , _p ) , &amp;c. ) , we find 61 .
For the scroll S(m , n , p ) , ( *m 1l 1)+(np-1-)+ ( 2np l)+n(m , s , p)=S -2=2rmnp-2 , which gives n(m , n , p ) =2nnp nn -mpn2p + 1 .
This includes the before-mentioned case n(1.5 m , n %)=(mn-1)(i-1 ) , and the more particular one n(1 , 1 , mn)=O .
62 .
For the scroll S(m2 , n ) , I[m]2_-1+M+2((m-1)n-1 ) +1 ( nM2 , )=S-2=n([9n]2+M)2 which gives fl(Qn2 , n)=n([L2]2-2n2+2+M ) l [ m]2+1 A. This includes the before-mentioned particular case n(l , m2)_=[m-2]2 .
63 .
And lastly for the scroll S(m3 ) , 3( [ 3m]2_-n+l+M)+f(qn3 ) =S-2= [ { m]3+ ( m2)M-2 , which gives l(m'3 ) = [ Lm]3 [ m]2+ 3m-5 +M(Mn-5 ) .

Consider the unicursal m-thic curve the equations whereof are x : y : z : w =A : B : C : D , where A , B , C , D are rational and integral functions of a parameter 0 .
And let be required to find the equation of a plane meeting the curve in such manner that three of the points of intersection are in lined .
I Taking for the equation of the plane rx-y+yz -+c*jw=0 , we find between ( 5 , w , ^ , x ) an equation of a certain degree in ( I , , , ce ) , which is the equation in plane-coordinates of the scroll S(rn3 ) , the degree of the equation is therefore equal to the class of the scroll ; but as the class of a scroll is equal to its order , the degree of the equation is equal to the order of the scroll , or say =S(m3 ) .
Proceeding with the investigation , if d be determined by the equation SA+nB + 4C+wD=O , then the roots 01 6^ ... 4 of this equation belong to the points of intersection of the plane and curve ; and the corresponding coordinates of these points are ( A1 , B1 Cl , D1 ) , &amp;c. Suppose that the points 1 , 2 , 3 are in lined , and let X , pi , v , g be the coordinates of an arbitrary point , then the four points are n piano , that is , we have..X pl oy , 'e =O ; A , , B , , C , , D , I A2 , B2 , C2 , D2 A3 , B3 , C3 , D3 and if we form the equation X , ( 4 , Y , g =0 , Al , BI , C0 , D2 A2j B2 , C2 D2A3 , B3 , C3 , D3 where II denotes the product of the terms belonging to all the triads of the m roots , the result will be symmetrical in regard to all the roots ; and replacing the symmetrical functions of the roots by their values in terms of the coefficients , we have the required relation between ( , , w ) .
II contains -[]3 terms , whereof 'm[-1]2 contain them-thic functions ( A , , B1 , Ci , D , ) of the root 01 ; that is , the form of HI is ( x : , ,l Y , V ) where C(djl ... d.)=Disct .
=( , , )am_ and consequently 7l(0l-8 02(.)(-3)(0203 ) =( , ) [ )m-132 , so that , omitting this factor , the remaining factor of II is of the form ( X ) 04 &gt; V ) 5ffi)iUm ] ( M ) 11 , C ; X)-nM]3-[m-I]2i but the determinant vanishes if U. , Y = , B=(A1 , B2 , Ci , D , ) , ( A , B , C , , D ) , ( A3 , B ) , or say if ( X , 4 , v , ?
)=(A , B , C , D ) , d=81 , 02 , or 03 ; it follows that the product II contains the factor ( A+y , +v+S)3 tf ] 3 ; or omitting this factor , and observing that I[n1]3 -r 1[ nm13= i-]3M [ n j]2= [ m _]3 , the remaining factor is of the form ( , g , wm-1]3 ; or we have finally S(nn3)= [ m-1]3 , which is the required expression .
I give the following investigation of the expression nM-I 1]2 for the number of apparent double points .
Imagine through the point ( a=O , y=0 , z=O ) a line cutting the curve in the two points corresponding to the values 60 , 02 of the parameter .
We have A1 B , C1 A2BgC which equations determine 60 and 02 .
Writing the equations under the form A1B2-A2B1 A2-A2C and treating 80 and 02 as coordinates , each of these equations belongs to a curve of the order 2(m-1 ) , having a ( m-l)thic point at infinity on each of the axes .
The number of intersections thus is = 4(m1)2_ ( M1)2(m-1)2 =2(in1)2 .
But among these are included points not belonging to the original system , viz. the points for which ( A1=0 , A2=O ) other than those for which 01=02 ; the points so included are in number ==m2-m ; and omitting them , the number is ( 2(m-1)2-(m-_1 ) ) =[m_-]2 474 which is the number of points 0 , lying in linea with the origin and another point 02 ; the number of apparent double points is the half of this , or h= [ m1]2 .
And thence M=(-I[m]2+h=)-(m--l ) I investigate also the number of lines through two points which meet two arbitrary lines ; this is in fact =S(1 , m2 ) , which for the curve in question is ( [ ]2A_ ( r-_1 ) =)(-11)2 .
Let the equations of the two lines be ( x=0 , y= 0 ) and ( z= 0 , w=0 ) ; then the conditions to be satisfied are A1 1B1 C D1 A2-B2 ' C2 D2 ' or writing these under the form A , B2-A2B1 C D2-C2D I03 =0 0~ and treating 01 , 02 as coordinates , the number of intersections of these two curves is =2(n-l1)2 , the same as in the two curves last above considered .
And the number of the lines in question is one half of this , or =(m--1)2 .

Annex No. 2.-Investigation of the formula for S(m3 ) , when the curve in is the pq complete intersection , viz , .
when it is the intersection of two surfaces of the orders p and q respectively ( referred to , Art .
40 ) .
Let U= 0 , V= 0 be the equations of the two surfaces of the orders p and q respectively .
Take ( x , y , z , w ) the coordinates of a point on the curve , so that for these coordinates we have U=0 , V=0 ; and in the equations of the two curves respectively , write for the coordinates x+gx ' , y+y ' , z+g ' , w+gw ' ; then putting for shortness A=L =tx+yg y+ Z't , +wla , the resulting equations may be represented by ( AU , A2U , ...

AqVl , )-=0 , where it is to be noticed that besides the expressed literal coefficients there are numerical coefficients ( not as the notation usually denotes , the binomial coefficients , but ) =1 1.-2 1.239 &amp;c. Supposing that ( x , y ' , z ' , w ' ) are the current coordinates of a point on the line drawnv through the point ( x , y , z , w ) to meet the curve in two other points , the equations in g must have two common roots , and this gives a system equivalent to two equations , or say a plexus of two equations .
If from the plexus and the two equations U=0 , V==0 we eliminate ( x , y , z , w ) , we obtain an equation S ' =0 in ( S ' , y ' , z ' , w ' ) , which is in fact the equation of the scroll S(m3 ) , taken ( as is easily seen to be the case ) thrice ; that is , S(m3 ) = BDegree of S ' .

Annex No. 3.-Investigation of G(rn4 ) in the case where the curve m is a pg complete intersection ( referred to , Art .
42 ) .
Suppose , as before , that U=O , V=O are the equations of the two surfaces of the orders p and q respectively ; taking also ( x , y , z , w ) as the coordinates of a point on the curve , and substituting in the equations x-fgx ' , y+gy ' , z+sgz ' , w+gw ' in place of the coordinates , then if A= x"a , +yoa y+ z ' 4+ww , we have as before ( AU , A2U,. .

AqV(1 , ?
) , -l=0 , where the numerical coefficients 1l , 1 ] , 1--3 , &amp;c. are to be understood as before .
Suppose now that ( x , y , z , w ) are the coordinates of a point on the curve , through which point there passes a line through three other points , or line G(m4 ) ; and that ( x ' , y ' , z , w ' ) are the current coordinates of a point on such line : the two equations in g must have three equal roots ; or we must have a system equivalent to three equations , or say a plexus of three equations .
The coordinates ( x ' , y ' , z ' , w ' ) , although four in 478 number , are in fact elimillable from this plexus ; or what is the same thing , combining with the plexus the equation ax'+P/ 3+yZ'+Hw'=O of an arbitrary plane , and then eliminating ( x ' , y , z ' , w ' ) , the result is of the form ( azx+A3y+yrz+w)0 =0 , where C is a function of ( x , y , z , w ) only ; and considering ( x , y , z , w ) as weight variables , 0= Order of Plexus .
But degree in ( x , y , z , w ) of ( ax++ pyy+z+w)oC is =Weight of Plexus , and therefore Degree of Cl is = Weight of Plexus-C , =(WeightOrder ) of Plexus .
The equations U=0 , V=O , =0 then give the coordinates ( x , y , z , w ) of the points through which may be drawn a line G(m4 ) ; viz. they give ( as it is easy to see ) these points four times over .
And we therefore have G(n4 ) -= Order of ( U 0 , V=0 , =0 ) =Deg .

Or representing the terms by their order and weight ( the weight variables being in the present case ( x , y , z , w ) , and the order variables ( , y ' , z ' , w ' ) , and attributing as before an order and weight to the evanescent terms , the system is p+ -3 columnm .

Annex No. 4.-Order of 'Torse ( mn , n ) ( referred to , Art .
44 ) .
We have to find the order of the developable or Torse generated by a line meeting two curves of the orders n , n respectively ; viz. representing by P , v the classes of the two , curves respectively , it is to be shown that the expression for the Order is Torse ( n , n)=my ?
+np .
I remark , in the first place , that , given two surfaces of the ordersp and q respectively , the curve of intersection is of the order pgq and class pq(p+q-2 ) , or as this may be written , class =qgp(p-l ) +pq(-1 ) .
Reciprocally for two surfaces of the classesp and q respectively , the Torse enveloped by their common tangent planes is of the class pq and order Qp(pl ) ?
pq(q ) .
Now , in the same way that a surface of the order p may degenerate into a Torse of the order p , so a surface of the class p may degenerate into a curve of the classp ; and the class of a curve being p , then ( disregarding singularities ) its order is =p(p -1 ) .
Hence replacing p and p(p 1 ) by S and in respectively , and in like manner q and q(q-1 ) by v and n respectively , we have my-j-np as the order of the Torse generated by the tangent planes of the curves of the orders m and n respectively ; where by tangent plane of a curve is to be understood a plane passing through a tangent line of the curve .
The intersection of two consecutive tangent planes is a line meeting the two curves , which line is the generating line of the Torse , and such Torse is therefore the Torse ( m , n ) in question .
The foregoing investigation is not very satisfactory , but I confirm it by considering the case of two plane curves , orders mn and n , and classes p and v , respectively .
The tangents of the two curves can , it is clear , only meet on the line of intersection of the planes of the curves ; and the construction of the Torse is in fact as follows : from any point of the line of intersection draw a tangent to mn and a tangent to n , then the line joining the points of contact of these tangents is a generating line of the Torse .
The order of the Torse is equal to the number of generating lines which meet an arbitrary line ; and taking for the arbitrary line the line of intersection of the two planes , it is easy to see that the only generating lines which meet the line of intersection are those for which one of the points of contact lies on the line of intersection ; that is , they are 482 the generating lines derived from the points in which the line of intersection meets one or other of the two curves ; they are therefore in fact the tangents drawn to the curve n from the points in which the line of intersection meets the curve n , together with the tangents drawn to the curve rm from the points in which the line of intersection meets the curve n. Now the line meets the curve n in n points , and from each of these there are p tangents to the curve m ; and it meets the curve m in m points , and from each of these there are Y tangents to the curve n ; hence the entire number of the tangents in question is =npc-+my , which confirms the theorem .
Annex No. 5.-Order of Torse ( m2 ) ( referred to , Art .
46 ) .
We have here to find the order of the developable or Torse generated by a line meeting a curve of the order m twice , viz. , the class of the curve being p , it is to be shown that we have Torse ( nm2)=(n3)pj .
I deduce the expression from the formula given p. 424 of Dr. SALMON'S ' Geometry of Three Dimensions ; ' viz. putting in his formula =0Q , and p for his r , we have Order =m( -4 ) -la =m--(4mn+ ) , where ( see p. 234 et seq. ) p m(sm-1)2h9 a-t=(n-m)=3m(mn 2)-6h-m , and thence 3 -2|=4m , or 4m+2==3p , so that we have Order = ( m 3)p .
A more complete discussion of the Torses ( m , n ) and ( im2 ) is obviously desirable ; but as they are only incidentally connected with the subject of the present memoir , I have contented myself with obtaining the required results in the way which most readily presented itself .
