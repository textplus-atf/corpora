" On Quinidine , and some Double Tartrates of the Organic Bases .
" By JOIIN STENHOUSE3 , LL. D. , F.R.S. Received February 23 , 1863 .
Quinidine , as is well known , was first observed by Henry and Delondre , and likewise by Sertuerner , in what is called the " quinidine " of commerce , which consists chiefly of a mixture of quinidine , quinine , and resinous matters obtained from the mother-liquors of the suilpbate-of-quinine manufacture .
Van Heijningen , however , was the first person who succeeded in separating quinidine , which he called ( 3-quinine , from this mixture and in obtaining it in a pure and crystalline state .
He likewise ascertained that quinidine was isomeric with quinine .
Its action on polarized light was studied by Pasteur , who observed that its solution in absolute alcohol produces deviation to thie right , while a similar solution of quinine produces rotation to the left ( Buchardat ) .
As comparatively few of the salts of quinidine have hitherto been analysed , and those chiefly by Van Ileijningen , I was iniduced to prepare a few more of them , and likewise to examine the action of iodide of ethyl upon the alkaloid itself .
I am indebted for the quinidine which I employed for this purpose to Mr. John Elliott Howard of Stratford .
It was perfectly white , and consisted of large , well-defined crystals .
Before using it , however , I recrystallized it out of alcohol .
The quinidine gave a green colour with chlorinewater and ammonia , and the solutions of its salts all exhibited a fluorescent power almost equal to that of quiniine .
A solution of its sulphate likewise yielded Hierapath 's so-called sulphate of iodoquinidine , crystallizing in long quadrilateral prisms possessing a deep garnet-red colour and the other well-known characters of that salt .
*343 gramme of pure quinidine , dried at 1000C .
, gave *9315 gramme carbonic acid and '238 gramme water .
This corresponds to 74 04 per cent. of carbon and 7'71 per cent. of hydrogen .
The formula C4L H24 N2 04 requires 74-08 and 7-4 per cent. Quinidine Platinum-salt , C401124 N2 04 , 21 Cl + Pt C1 , .
-On the addition of bichloride of platinum to a solution of hydrochlorate of quinidine , an immediate precipitate takes place if the solution be cold and concentrated ; but if dilute or hot solutions be employed , it only crystallizes out after some time .
It is very insoluble both in cold and in hot water , but crystallizes from boiling dilute hydrochloric acid in brilliant but irregularly-formed crystals , which decomposed when heated to about 2000 C. , evolving a peculiar aromatic odour somewhat resembling that of hawthorn..485 gramme of this salt , when dried at 150 ?
C. , on ignition gave *1995 gramme of metallic platinum .
This corresponds to 26f66 per cent. The formtula C40 24 N2 04 , 21 Cl + 2Pt Cl , requires 26 81 per cent. Both quinidine and its platinum-salt were first analysed many years ago by Baron Liebig ; but as he employed amorphous quinoidine for this purpose , Gerhardt supposes that he operated on a mixture of the three isomeric alkaloids , quinidine , quiniicine , and quinine .
Quinidine Gold-salt , C40 2 , N , 0 , , 21 C1+ 2Au Cl,.-The goldsalt is prepared by dissolving quinidine in hydrochloric acid and adding excess of terchloride of gold , when it falls as a bright yellow powder .
This salt appears to be decomposed by boiling with water , turning brown and apparently fusin , .
It is therefore necessary to precipitate it in the cold .
Well washed and dried in vacuo , oln heatino to 1000 it lost about -5 per cent. , probably hygroscopic water ; when further heated to 1150 , it fuised , turned browni , and began to decom .
pose .
'3575 gramme of gold-salt dried at 100 ?
gave *14 gramme of metallic gold .
This is equivalent to 39 15 per ceint .
The formula o04 02 04 , 211 C+2Au C13 requires 39'2 per cent. Nihtrate-of-Silver Salt of Quinidinie , 0C4 , 12 , N 04 , Ag NO , .
This was prepared by adding , nitrate-of-silver solution to any alcoholic solution of quinidine ; the mixture becamne semisolid from precipitation of the above salt in the form of minute n-eedles .
These were thrown on a filter and thoroughly washed with cold water , in which they are scarcely at all soluble .
The compound was then recrystallized from hot water slightly acidulated with nitric acid ; after filtration it separates , on cooling , in beautiful silky needles , which , on being freed from the mother-liquor and dried between bibulous paper , htave almost the lustre of metallic silver , such as is produced on igniting its organic salts .
It partially decomposes every time it is recrystallized , but much more so when spirit is substituted for water , the solution becoming black from reduced silver .
*40 1tgramme of the salt , dried at 100 ?
, gave 115 chloride of silver , corresponding to '08656 gramme of metallic silver .
This gives 21'59 per cent. According to the formula 020 " 24 N2 04 , Ag NO6 , theory requires 21 86 per cent. Mercuro-hydrochlorate of Quinidcine , C40H124 N204 , 21-1Cl+ Hg Cl. -On mixing solutions of hydrochlorate of quinidine and chloride of mercury , the above salt is precipitated as a white powder .
It is slightly soluble in cold water , much more so in hot , especially when acidulated with hydrochloric acid ; but it cannot be conveniently crystallized from this menstruum , as it sometimes separates in resinous masses .
By far the best solvent from which to crystallize is boiling alcohol , in which it is readily soltuble , separating in nacreous scales as the solution cools .
It fuses at 100G under water , but not when dry .
'626 gramme of the above salt , dried at 1000 , yields *507 chloride of silver , which gives of chlorine 20'04 per cent. The formula C40 1124 N2 04 21101 + Hg Cl requires 20'00 per cent. Zinco-hydr-ocklorate of Quinidine , C01H24 , N20,4 21 HC1+2ZaC1 .
A moderately strong solution of chloride of zinc , containing a slight excess of hydrchloric acid , is poured into an alcoholic solution of quinidine , when the double salt precipitates as a granular powder .
It is very slightly soluble either in hot or in cold water , but dissolves readily in dilute hydrochloric acid and in spirit of 50 per cent. , from which latter it crystallizes in a form very similar to that variety of carbonate of lime known as " dog-tooth " spar .
The specimen analysed was crystallized from dilute hydrochloric acid and dried at l00 ? .
-447 gramme gave *4825 gramme chloride of silver , equal to 1193 of chlorine .
This corresponds to 267 per cent. of chlorine .
The formula C40 1124N 2 04 211 Cl+2Zn Cl requires 26X65 per cent. Basic Chloride-of-Zinc Salt , C41124N2 04 , HCI+ZnC1.-The neutral salt described above appears to lose a portion of its hydrochloric acid and chloride of zinc after repeated crystallizations .
A solution of the salt so treated deposits , upon slow evaporation , crystals of considerable size , consisting of hexagonal plates and 'prisms .
After drying at 1000 , these were sul)mitted to analysis ; the zinc and quilnidine were precipitated together by carbonate of soda , and asfter washing well with water , the quinidine was removed by boiling alcohol ; the residuary oxide of zinc was them again washed with water , and ignited in the usual way..7335 gramme of the salt yielded *0680 grarnme of oxide of ' zinc , equivalent to *05456 of metallic zinc , or 7-44 per cent. The formula C 40 -1 N2 04 , 2H C1 +2 Zn Cl requires 12 2 per cent. The formula C40 H121 N2 O , , E Cl + Zn Cl requires 7-58 per cent. Oxalate of Quinidine , C040 1-2 .
N2 01 I-I C2 OV 11O.-The oxalate of quinidine is formed by exactly nieutralizing oxalic acid by quinidine .
It consists of very small brittle crystals , which are almost insoluble in cold , but comparatively soluble in hot water , from which it crystallizes again on cooling .
After being purified by two recrystallizations and dried at 1000 , it was submitted to analysis .
-206 gramme gave -502 carbonic acid and *133 water ; this corresponds to 66 45 per cent. of carbon and 7-17 of hydrogen .
The formula C40 1124 N204,0 1020 04+110 requires 66-67 per cenit .
carbon and 6-88 per cent. hydrogen .
This is evidently , therefore , the neutral oxalate , and differs wholly in appearance and properties from the acid oxalate , C00 H , 2 04 , 120408 + 2Aq , obtained by Van Ileijningen .
Picrate of Quinidine.-Quinidine dissolves in a boiling and not too concentrated solution of picr'ic acid ; but it separates on cooling , not in crystals , but as a resinouis mass .
When dissolved in hot alcobol , it is deposited by evaporation of the solution in resinous nodules , thus very closely resemlbling , the corresponding salt of quiiiiine .
Action of Iodide of Ethyl on Quinidine.-Iodide of ethyl attacks quinidine very readily , so that if the two substances ( the former being in excess ) be heated together in a flask furnished with a perforated cork and lonw tube to condense the iodide of ethyl , combination quickly ensues , and in half an hour the reaction is complete .
Water is then added and the excess of iodide distilled off , the residue dissolved in diluite alcohol , filtered , and allowed to crystallize .
On cooling , the solution becomes semnisolid , from separation of the iodide of ethyl-quinidine in the form of long silky needles .
These are well washed with cold water , in which they are almost insoluble , and then recrystallized from boiling dilute spirit , washed , dried at l00 ?
, and submitted to anialysis .
-5600 gramme yielded -2735 gramme iodide of silver , equivalent .
to -1478 of iodide , or 26 39 per cent. The formula 410 2JN20 4}J requires 26-46 per cent. of iodine .
Platinum-salt of Ethyl-quinidine , Co II N 0 ?
I C1 } 2Pt C12 .
4 IL 2 t24 11c On treating the foregoing iodide with chloride of silver the chlorine replaces the iodinie , tand we obtain chloride of ethyl-quinidine in solution and iodide of silver .
The latter is separated by filtration , and the solutioni , niow free from iodine , is precipitated by the addition of bichloride of platinum .
The platinum-salt separates as a paleyellow powder , almost insoluble either in hot or in cold water , and but sparingly soluble in boiling dilute hydrochloric acid , from which it separates almost completely on cooling .
The specimen analysed was simply washed with water and dried at 100( .
*537 gramme gave 137 metallic platinum , corresponding to 25 61 per cent. 2N The formula C 11H N 04C4 H11c0 2 Pt C12 requires 25'86 per cent. Hydrated Oxide of Ethyl-quinidine .
On treating the iodide of ethyl-quinidine with oxide of silver in slight excess , a solution of the hydrated oxide is obtained .
It is very bitter to the taste , readily attracting carbonic acid from the air , and is of course highly alkaline to test-paper .
On evaporation it does not crvstallize .
Action of Iodlide of E thyl on Ilydrcated Oxide of Etthyl-quinidine .
-When iodide of ethyl and a strong solution of hydrated oxide of ethyl-quinidine are made to react upon each other in a sealed tube at the temperature of 100 ?
, a mass of crystals are produced after digestion for about an hour .
These were extracted from the tube , washed with a little water , dried between folds of filtering-paper , and recrystallized from dilute alcohol .
On analysis , they proved to be nothing more than reproduced iodide of ethyl-quinidine .
*4435 gramme gives 2165 of iodide of silver , correspolnding to *117 of iodine , or 26-38 per cent. The formula C4 215 2"4 } I requires 26A46 per cent. From these experiments it appears that quinidine contains no replaceable hydrogen , and in this respect it agrees with quilline and cinchonine , the alkaloids with which it is associated .
Double Tartrate of Quinidine and Antimony , C40 121N2 04 11 C IH 0 SbO , 8 '0 120 When an excess of quinidine in powder is added to a cold saturated solution of tartar-emetic , and heat applied so soon as the mixture begins to boil , the quinidine pretty rapidly dissolves , whilst at the same time a quantity of oxide of antimony is precipitated .
The solution is filtered whilst boiling , and on cooling the double tartrate of quiniidine and antimony is deposited in very lonig fine silky nleedles , often more than an inch in length .
Any excess of quinidine which has been employed , together with the oxide of antimony which has been precipitated , remains upon the filter .
The double tartrate is but slightly soluble in cold water , but dissolves easily in hot , from which it may readily be crystallized .
It is also very soluble in boiling spirit of wine , from which it is deposited , almost completely on cooling , in tufts of slender needles .
The douible tartrate of quilnidine and antimony was very carefuilly examined for potassa by precipitating the antimoniy by means of suiphuretted hydrogen ; it then left lno perceptible residue on ignition , and a drop of bichloride of platinum gave no precipitate .
It therefore could not contain potassa .
Analysis.-Dried in vacuo over sulphuric acid , it retains , appareitly uncombined , from 5 to 1 per cent. of water , which it loses at the temperature of 1000 .
The salt dried in vacuo gave the following results I. 0 3850 gramme gave 6750 gramme carbonic acid and 1780 gramme water .

2375 gramme gave 4175 gramme carbonic acid and 1270 gramme water .

V. '5110 gramme gave *893 gramme carbonic acid and -224 gramme water .
VI .
*7195 gramme substance gave *1949 gramme tersulphide of antimony .
This was dried in vacuo and contained 1P3 per cent. of water ; therefore 17195 gramme is equal to *7101 dried at 1000 .

o0 8 144..2363 Sb = 120-3 19-74 2053 1961 609-3 100-006 In order to ascertain that the residue upon the filter , in addition to undissolved quinidine , contained precipitated teroxide of antimony , it was washed with hot alcohol and dissolved in strong hydrochloric acid .
This solution gave the characteristic reactions of anti .
money with water and sulphuretted hydrogen .
The mother-liquor , which was quite neutral to test-paper , and from which as much as possible of the quinidine-salt had been separated by concentrationi , was treated by sulphuretted hydrogen to separate the antimony , and was tested for potassa and for tartaric acid , both of which it was found to contain .
The reaction may therefore be represented by the following equation:2 Sb ?

b. Sb 0 , C8ifI012 + 84 8 24 12 +b 03In order to colnfirm this view of the comiiposition of the salt , some acid tartrate of quinidine was prepared by taking a solution of tartaric acid , dividing it equally into two portions , nieutralizing the one with quinidine , and then adding the other .
This solution was then boiled for some hours with excess of freshly-precipitated oxide of antimony , filtered , and allowed to cool , when the same beautiful salt made its appearanice , idelntical in all its properties with the compounld formed by boiling tartar-emetic with quinidine .
It will be obvious from these results that tartar-emetic , when boiled with quinidine , undergoes a somewhat sinigular and unexpected decomposition , neutral tartrate of potassa and the double tartrate of quinidine and antimony being , formed , while one-half of the antimony of the original salt is precipitated as oxide .
From this and the subsequently to be described double tartrates , the tersulphide of antimony which is precipitated has a light yellow or pale orange colour , and , after being lolng washed with boiling water , still contains some of the base , probably in the state of a salt .
This portion of the alkaloid may , however , be abstracted from the tersulphide of anltimony by digesting it with hot alcohol .
In order to confirm the fact that the compound contained quinidine and not -an altered base , as it may be observed from the analyses given above that the carbon in the double tartrates is somewhat too high , the antimony was removed from a portion of the salt by means of sulphuretted hydrogen , the base precipitated by amnmonia , well washed with water , and crystallized out of spirit ; it was them obtained with the usual crystalline form assumed by quinidilne , viz. 4-sided prisms , and gave the characteristic reactioni with chlorine-water and ammonia .
A platinum-salt also was prepared in the usual way , which , recrystallized from dilute hydrochloric acid , gave the following analytical result : *411 gramme gave *1075 gramme metallic platinum ; this corresponds to 26 16 per cent. C E24 N O , 2H C1 +2 Pt Cl requires 26-81 per cent. The Tartrate of St2ychnine and Antimony , GII1NO H ~CH 0 42 22 24 Sb02 8 It 212 was likewise prepared by adding strychlline to a boiling solution of tartar-emetic .
The same solution of the alkaloid and precipitation of oxide of antimony were observed as in the case of quitnidine .
Oa cooling , the double tartrate was deposited in very brittle needles , much less soluble in water than the corresponding quinidine-salt .
It occasionally crystallizes in leafy plates .
The following results were obtained in the analysis of the salt dried at 100 ?

It was then obtained in quadrilateral prisms with pyramidal summits , and gave the usual reactions with sulphuric acid and bichromate of potassa .
