were considered by them merely as approximations ; since it could not have been otherwise overlooked , that the arithmetical mean is in no case the result which is strictly deducibler from the arcs , and that , in many instances , it must differ considerably from the more correct deduction ; whilst ' the adoption of this method in general practice , has charged the results with an error , which might have been avoided ; the amount of which can only now be known , when the details of the observation have been given , and furnish the means of re-computation .
The perfect balancing of the needle is sometimes attempted by a cross of wires affixed to the axis , as described in the Philosophical Transactions for 1772 , Article 35 ; bt this contrivance is more ingenious than useful in practice , and introduces a liability to errors , of far more importance than the inconveniences which it was designed to obviate .
The adjustment of the balance , after the needle is magnetised , is in itself a troublesome , tedious , and uncertain operation , and is far too subject to derangement to be confided in , when the instrument has been removed from station to station ; moreover , the inaccuracies occasioned by friction , are augmented by the additional weight of the mechanism on the one arm of the axis , and of a counterweight on the other .
The errors of an-imperfect balance are reducible by calculation , but those of friction are not so ; whether they may arise from the axis not being truly cylindrical , or from the inequalities of its surface producing a resistance on the planes , which the moving force of the needle is not fully adequate to overcome .
It may be , therefore , justly remarked , that the true and unimpeded motion of the axis , and the consequent return of a needle in successive trials to the same division of the limb , is one of the principal qualifications of a good dipping needle .
Having been convinced by the trial of several needles , that the disagreement in their results was chiefly to be attributed to the various causes of inaccuracy in the motion of the axis , I requested Mr. DOLLOND to make a needle on a construction suggested , from similar experience , by Professor J. TOBIAS MEYER , in his treatise " de usu accuratiori acuis inclinatoriae Magneticae , " published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Sciences at Gottingen for 1814 .
The experiments which are now submitted to the Royal Society were made with this needle , which , for simplicity of construction , convenience in use , and consistency of results , appears to deserve a preference over those which have been hitherto employed .
As the needle which Mr. DOLLOND made , differed in some few particulars from the construction recommended by Professor MEYER , it may be proper to prefix a short description of it , as well as of the mode of observation .
The needle is a parallelopipedon of eleven inches and a half in length , four tenths in breadth , and one twentieth in thickness ; the ends are rounded ; and a line marked on the face of the needle passing through the centre to the extremities , answers the purpose of an index .
The cylindrical axis on which the needle revolves , is of bell metal , terminated , where it rests on the agate planes , by cylinders of less diameter ; the finer these terminations are made , so long as they do not bend with the weight of the needle , the more accurate will be the oscillations ; small 4 grooves in the thicker part of the axis receive the Y 's , which raise and lower the needle on its supports , and ensure that the same parts of the axis rest in each observation on the planes .
A small brass sphere traverses on a steel screw , inserted in the lower edge of the needle , as nearly as possible in the perpendicular to the index line passing through the axis of motion ; by this mechanism , the centre of gravity of the needle , with the screw and sphere , may be made to fall more or less below the axis of motion , according as the sphere is screwed nearer or more distant from the needle , and according as spheres of greater or less diameter are employed .
The object proposed in thus separating the centres of motion and gravity , is to give to the needle a force arising from its own weight to assist that of magnetism in overcoming the inequalities of the axis , and thus to cause the needle to return , after oscillation , with more certainty to the same point of the divided limb , than it would do were the centres strictly coincident .
The centres of motion and of gravity not coinciding , the position which the needle assumes , when placed in the magnetic meridian , is not that of the dip : but the dip is deducible , by an easy calculation , from observations made with such a needle , according to the following directions .
If the needle has been carefully made , and the screw inserted truly as described , the centres of motion and of gravity will be disposed as in the lever of a balance , when a right line joining them will be a perpendicular to the horizontal passing through the extremities ( or to the index line ) ; this condition is not indeed a necessary one , but it is desirable to be accomplished , because it shortens the observations , as well as the calculation , from whence the dip is deduced ; its'fulfilment may be ascertained with great precision by placing the needle on the agate planes before magnetism is imparted to it , and observing whether it returns to a horizontal direction , after oscillation in each position of the axis ; if it does not , it may be made to do so at this time with no great trouble .
With a needle in which this adjustment can be relied on , two observations made in the magnetic meridian are sufficient for the determination of the dip , the two faces of the needle being successively towards the observer , reversing the position of the axis on its supports in such manner that the edge of the needle which is uppermost in the one observation becomes lowermost in the other ; the angles which the needle makes with the vertical in these two positions being read , the mean of the tangents of those angles is the co-tangent of the dip .
But when needles are used in which this adjustment has not been made , or where its accuracy cannot be relied on , four observations are required ; two being those which are already directed ; the two others are similar to them , but with the poles of the needle reversed ; calling then the first arcs F and J ; and those with the poles reversed G and g , and taking tang F+ tanf= A tang F tanf_ B tang G +tang =C tang Gtan gD A.D BB+B +~~= twice the co-tangent of the dip .
6 The demonstration of this formula is given in the treatise which has been referred to ; the investigation is simple .
In reversing the poles , it is not necessary that the magnetic force imparted to the needle should be the same in amount as it possessed previously to the operation .
By adopting the precaution of placing the needle in a groove to prevent its lateral motion , and by confining the sides of the magnet by parallel strips of wood , so that in moving along the needle they may preserve its direction , the poles may always be ensured to coincide with the extremities of the longitudinal axis .
It is desirable to be furnished with several spheres of different diameters , to possess the means of proportioning the force , arising from the eccentricity , to the force of magnetism , as the latter is doubled between the equator and the poles ; it may be expedient that the force of magnetism should always predominate , though no such inference appears to result from the present experiments , in which eight spheres were used , numbered according to size , No. 1 being the largest .
If the distance between the centres of motion and of gravity be considerable , the arcs in the alternate observations will be on different sides of the vertical , especially where the dip is great ; in such cases the arcs to the south of the vertical are read negatively .
The instrument in which the needle was tried is already described in the Philosophical Transactions for 1819 , page 132 , and several improvements which have been since added , in the Appendix to Captain PARRY'S Voyage of Discovery , pages cvii .
cxxxix .
, &amp;c. ; the perfect horizontality of the agate planes , and the adjustments of the zeros of the circle were verified in every change , of position of the instrument by the double cone apparatus described in page cxl .
, which proves very convenient in use , and is highly conducive to accuracy ; the circle is divided into spaces of twenty minutes , but by means of a moveable lens , the arcs to which the needle settles can be read off , with tolerable correctness , to minutes ; the arcs , in each of the four positions forming the elements from whence the dip is deduced , are the arithmetical mean of ( usually ) six observations , half of which are with the face of the circle towards the east , and half with the face towards the west ; the needle being lifted by the Y 's and lowered gently on its supports between each observation ; the arcs indicated by both ends of the needle are also read , to correct the errors arising from inequality in the divisions , or from the axis of the needle not passing correctly through the centre of the circle .
The experiments were made in the nursery garden in the Regent 's Park , by permission of Mr. JENKINS , the proprietor .
The situation is in all respects an eligible one , being far removed from the neighbourhood of iron .
The two first experiments are given in detail , that the method of observation may be more fully exemplified .
Experiment i. August gd , 1821 , with sphere No. 8 , midway between the edge of the needle and the end of the screw , In this experiment all the arcs were on the north side of the vertical , and were therefore all read positively .

The screw on which the spheres traversed was made , in the first instance , half an inch in length , but was shortened one half after the third experiment ; being found still longer than necessary , it was again shortened after the eighth experiment , until its length just equalled the diameter of the largest sphere .
Being desirous to confirm the correctness of the result obtained with MEYER'S needle , I made the following experiments for the purpose of deducing at least an approximation of the dip by a method suggested , I believe , originally by LAPLACE , of observing the times in which a certain number of oscillations are made by a dipping needle , in the magnetic meridian , and in the plane perpendicular to it .
The force acting on the needle in the latter case is reduced , according to the principles of the resolution of forces , in the ratio of the radius to the sine of the dip ; whence calling M the time in which a certain number of vibrations are made in the meridian , P the corresponding time in the perpendicular plane , and D the dip , -pa sine D. In all the subsequent experiments , the needles were retained and released at an angle of 40 ?
with the meridian , by an apparatus for that purpose fitted to the instrument , and were suffered to oscillate until the arc of vibration was reduced to o00 before the account was taken up , and the observation commenced .
Exp. i. Sept. 3d , with a dipping needle , the centre of gravity of which was rendered nearly coincident with the axis of motion , by a slider of silk advanced towards the end which was previously too light , until the needle in the meridian stood at 70 ?
nearly , and became vertical when the instrument was moved 90 ?

Experiment g. 70 o6,5 ) This was a nearer accordance with the direct observation with MEYER'S needle than I had anticipated .
As this method , which is highly deserving of adoption in the lower magnetic latitudes , must become far less certain in parallels so high as 70 ?
, when a very small alteration in either of the observed times will produce a wide difference in the conclusion : unless , therefore , the oscillation of a needle in suitable arcs can be continued through a number of seconds , much exceeding those of the preceding experiments , the result may be liable , without great care and frequent repetition , to considerable error .
I am not aware that a method of deducing the dip on a similar principle , but possessing the same advantages in the high latitudes as the former does between the magnetic equator and 45 ?
( nearly ) , has been heretofore suggested : it is by observing the times in which a certain number of oscillations are Inade by the same needle in the following positions ; first , when used as a dipping needle , vibrating in the plane of the meridian ; and , secondly , when suspended horizontally by a silk thread attached to either end of the axis , the needle being limited thereby to a horizontal motion .
The square of the times of horizontal vibration being increased , as the radius to the cosine of the dip , it is obvious , that , as in the former method , the effect of errors of observation on the result increases with the angle of the dip , i6 according as the differences of the sines progressively diminish ; soin this method , on the contrary , the influence of such errors will be lessened in the same ratio : thus in dips of 65 ?
and upwards , the determination may be made with very considerable accuracy , with instruments generally of good construction , and with needles of which the terminations of the axis are very slender .
The horizontal vibrations should be made under a cover of glass , or of wood with glass windows ; the silk suspension should be several inches in length , and perfectly free from twist .
The following experiment was made with the needle numbered 3 in the preceding ; the silk line was 15 inches in length , and was fastened in a groove near the end of the axis ; the oscillations were made in arcs under 25 ? .

o3 ' may be considered as the mean dip of the needle towards the north in the Regent 's Park , in August and September 1821 , within four hours of noon , being the limit within which all the experiments were made .
In referring to the observations which are recorded to have been made for the purpose of determining the dip in London in former years , those of Mr. NAIRNE , in 1772 , of Mr. CAVENDISH , in 1776 , and of Mr. GILPIN , in 185 , appear to have received , and to be deserving of , principal consideration ; the errors by which these severaldeterminations may have been affected , in consequence of the imperfections of the instruments , may be believed to have been confined within limits of no great etent , by the method of the observers , and ; by the precautions which they adopted ; as , however , the observations were made in houses in close built parts of the metropolis , they were all subject to the influence of local attraction , from whence may have originated errors of greater consequence possibly than those of the instruments ; nor can the application of a correction found by observing the difference of the dip , on the outside of the house , be considered an effectual remedy , inasmuch as the needle may still have been attracted by iron in the adjoining houses , or in the neighbourhood .
It needs only to try needles in different situations in a city , to be convinced how little idependance should be placed in the accuracy of such results ; it may , no doubt , be principally owing to this cause , rather than to instrumental error , that the dip at the Apartments of the Royal Society is stated in the Philosophical Transactions for the present year ( 1 821 ) , to be 7O1 6 ' or 710 42 ' .
As the observations of Mr. NAIRNE , in 1772 , and of Mr. CA^VtNDisH , in 1776 , do no differ very widely from each other , either in the date , or in the amount of the dip , their mean , 70 25 ' , in 774 , may be considered as the best approximation which can now be made to a knowledge of the amount of the dip in London at an early period .
By comparing this amount with the dip in the present year as above determined , we obtain 3 ' , o0 as a mean annual rate of diminution between 1774 and 1821 ; which is less by two .
fifths than the mean annual diminution at Paris between the years 1798 and 1814 , as deduced from the observations of Messrs. HUMBOLDT , GAY LUSSAC , and ARAGO ; whence it might be inferred , if sufficient dependence could be placed on the accuracy of the observations , that the annual variation of the dip in this part of the world , is greater now than it was 8o or 40 years since .
It is , however , worthy of notice , as being at least a curious coincidence , that if we take Mr. WHIsToN 's determination of the dip in 1720 , 75 ?
xo ' ( of which Mr. CAVENDISH remarked in the Philosophical Transactions for 1776 , Art .
21 , ) that '"he believed it to have been pretty accurate , as Mr. WHISTON observed in many parts of the kingdom , and his observations agreed well together , " we obtain between the years 1720 and 1774 , an annual diminution of 3,05 , which differs only three hundredths of a minute from the rate which has been now found for the succeeding 47 years .
It may not be useless , briefly to examine how far the knowledge of the amount of change , by direct observation , is capable of receiving confirmation by the effect which a diminution of dip must produce on the vibrations of a needle suspended horizontally .
If the intensity of the magnetic force be considered to vary in the ratio suggested by Dr. YOUNG , inversely as the square root of four diminished by three times the square of the sine of the dip , which ratio has been remarkably confirmed in dips from 70 to 9g degrees , by the experiments made during the late Arctic voyage ; the force acting on the horizontal needle , being reduced as the radius to the cosine , becomes inversely asls+ 3 ; s being the sine of the dip ; whence , in London , the duration of any number of horizontal vibrations would be increased by about 3--0 part , on a reduction of one minute in the dip .
The needle No. 3 .
of the preceding experiments , suspended in the manner therein described , and released at an arc of 40o from the meridian , will continue to vibrate more than forty minutes , making upwards of 400 vibrations , before the arcs become so small as to render the completion of each vibration illdistinct .
If the times of commencement and conclusion are observed in the method exemplified in the experiment with this needle , page 17 ; the duration of any number of vibrations may be readily and accurately determined to a part of a second ; if , therefore , 400 be taken as the experimental number , and the duration be supposed 42 minutes , or 2520 seconds , the reduction of 3 minutes of dip , which is presumed to take place annually , would cause an increase of two seconds and two-tenths in the time of vibration ; which difference may , perhaps , be considered sufficient to encourage the experiment , especially if a mean be taken of many observations in each year ; in which case it may be advisable to compare together observations made at the same season in successive years ; and perhaps , also , at the same hour of the day ; although the experiments of Messrs. HUMBOLDT and 20 GAY LUSSAC have shown , that if any hourly variation of the force does obtain , it is not sufficient to produce a perceptible effect in a time of vibration amounting to i 234 seconds , repeated at different hours of the day and night .
In conclusion , there appears reason to presume from the preceding experiments , that the dip itself may be determined by MEYER'S needle within a much smaller limit of uncertainty , than has hitherto been the case by needles of the usual construction ; as the results are subject only to those errors , which are reducible by repetition ; for in the ten experiments which have been submitted to the Society , the greatest difference of any one from the mean does not exceed three minutes ; the direct observation may , therefore , be considered as capable of sufficient precision , to justify inferences from repetition , at intervals of short duration ; both of the amount , and also of the uniformity , of the changes to which the dip is subject .
PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS .
I. The Bakerian Lecture .
An Account of Experiments to determine the amount of the Dip of the Magnetic Needle in London , in August 1821 ; with Remarks on the Instruments which are usually employed in such determinations .
By Captain EDWARD SABINE of the Royal Regiment of Artillery , F.R.S. Read November 2o , 1821 .
rHE increased attention which has been given of late years by several philosophers to the subject of magnetism , and the consequent advance which has been made in this branch of natural knowledge , render it desirable , that a greater degree of accuracy should be obtained in all respects , in observing its various terrestrial phenomena , than hitherto .
This remark applies especially to observations on the dip of the needle ; the instruments in general use for this purpose have received little or no improvement during the last fifty years , and produce results which can only be considered as approximate , even when the observer has made himself well acquainted with the various sources of inaccuracy in the instrument , and has adopted precautions to guard against , or remedy them .
Many of these , indeed , are not difficult of detection , and admit of compensation by certain known methods of observing ; such are those which are caused by incorrect graduation , by the eccentricity of the needle with respect to the divided circle , by the agate planes which support the axis of the needle not being truly horizontal , ; or by their non-coincidence with the right line joining the zeros of the circle .
The errors to which even the most careful determinations are subject , are to be referred chiefly to faults in the construction of the needle itself ; ist , to imperfection in the axis , whereby the needle , on being made to oscillate , will not return with certainty in repeated trials to the same division of the limb ; and , 2ndly , to the difficulty which even the most skilful artists experience , in the endeavour to make the axis of motion pass through the centre of gravity ; a condition which is essential to accuracy in the usual mode of observation , but of which it may be safely said , that its accomplishment admits of no very certain proof , and that it is rarely or never succeeded in .
It is obvious that a needle , of which the balance is not thus correctly adjusted , will not assume , on being suspended freely in the plane of the meridian , the direction which magnetism alone would have imparted to it , and that it will , in consequence , err sensibly from the true dip ; the remedy which has been recommended for this inconvenience , and which has become the usual practice , is to reverse the poles of the needle , and to take the arithmetical mean of the arcs indicated in four positions , as the true magnetic dip .
The sanction of this method by persons who are regarded as authorities , is a sufficient indication , that observations of the dip 2
