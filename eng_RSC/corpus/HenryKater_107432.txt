Firther Ezperiments on the Lzght of the Cassegrainian Telescope compared with that of the Gregorian .
By Captain Henry Kater , Brigade Major .
In a Letter addressed to the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks , Bart. K. B. P. R. S. Read November 18 , 1813 .
SIR , SINCE you did me the honour of submitting to the Royal Society my experiments on the comparative light of the Cassegrainian and Gregorian telescopes , I have been so fortunate as to have an opportunity of establishing the conclusions deduced from them by another experiment , the detail of wh'ich I trust will not prove unacceptable .
The telescopes used on the present occasion were the excellent Gregorian described in my former paper , and a new Cassegrainian constructed by Mr. CRICKMORE .
The diameter of the large speculum of this instrument is 4,9 inches , the distance between the mirrors only 18 inches , and it bears a power of about 550 ( as roughly determined by experiment ) with perfect distinctness and considerable light .
The magnifying powers used were 157 in the Cassegrainian , and 15 in the Gregorian ; these were carefully determined by experiment .
A circular piece of pasteboard was then prepared to close the end of the Cassegrainian telescope , and concentric circles were drawn on it at the distance of the twentieth of an inch from each other .
These were successively cut out till a card appeared decidedly brighter when viewed through the Cassegrainian than through the Gregorian .
The following measures were then taken .

7,152 5l I to , or as 678 to 90o .
It may perhaps be desirable to place the results of the three experiments in one point of view .
Thus , calling the ligflt of the Gregorian telescope in every instance 00o , we have the light of a telescope of the Cassegrainian form of equal power and aperture , by the first experiment 235 , by the second 148 , and by the third 234 .
The surprising agreement of the first and third experiments with each other , excites an inquiry as to the cause of the difference observable in the second , as equal care and attention were bestowed on all .
The Cassegrainian telescope used on that occasion I have been unable to procure again , but from the inquiries I have since made , there is some reason to believe that , in addition to the polish of the specula having been somewhat impaired , as remarked in my last paper , its convex mirror was too small to receive the whole cone of rays , and to this circumstance principally I am inclined to attribute the deficiency of light in the second experiment when compared with the first and third .
If the mean of all three experiments be taken , the relative quantity of light will be as goj to io ; but , if the second experiment be rejected , and the mean of the first and third be considered as correct , the light will be very nearly as L$ to io in favour of a telescope of the Cassegrainian form compared with one of the Gregorian construction .
I have the honour to remain , &amp;c. &amp;c. Ipswich , i6th July , 18i3 .
HENRY KAI ER .
P. S. A fact which appears to be somewhat analogous to that which i have observed , has been remarked by Dr. BREWSTER in his late treatise on Philosophical Instruments .
4 It is a curious fact , " he says , p. 44 , " that the circular images or the sections of the cone of rays , are never so distinct and well defined after the rays have crossed-as they are before ; " and again , p. 193S , " the sections of the cones of light are , in general , better defined , when they are taken between the object glass and its principal focus .
" APPENDIX .
SINCE the preceding paper was submitted to the Royal Society , I have made numerous experiments connected with the same subject for the purpose of bringing the results I then deduced to the test of a further examination , conducted in a different manner , and with a more simple apparatus .
My object was to determine the intensity of light reflected from a concave mirror at equal distances from its focus , and thus to decide , in a direct manner , whether any rays are lost in crossing each other at the place where an image is formed .
The mirror employed in these experiments belongs to an excellent Newtonian telescope ; its diameter is 4,6 , and its solar focus 22,5 inches .
This mirror was supported by means of a cylindrical rod of iron screwed to the back of the cell which contains it , on two upright pieces of wood mortised into a square board , which thus formed a frame in which the mirror might be fixed in any required position .
The mirror being placed to receive the rays of the sun , I held a card at such a distance within the focus , that the lumtinous circle formed by reflection was equal in diameter to the width of the card ; and having endeavoured to fix in my mind the degree of illumination , I suddenly removed the card far beyond the focus , and then brought it towards the mirror till the diameter of the luminous circle was the same as before .
In this position the degree of illumination appeared so far inferior to that before observed , as to admit of no hesitation in the decision .
Before I proceed to detail the experiments which foIlow , I must premise that of the eight persons who at different times were employed in making the observations , six were perfectly unacquainted with the subject of inquiry , and two of the six distinguished in the column of observers by the letters C , and W , were servants .
It will be seen , that I did not trust myself to make any observations till the fact I sought had been sufficiently established by others to leave no fear on my mind that I might be influenced by any preconceived opinion .
I drew a line across a card , which line I divided into tenths of an inch .
The mirror was placed at the distance of fourteen feet from a candle , and the card moved in the reflected light within the focus till the diameter of the luminous circle was equal to the width of the card , in which position an observer was directed to remark carefully the intensity of the illutnination .
The card was then suddenly carried far beyond the focus and brought slowly towards it till the observer pronounced the intensity of the light to be the same as before , at which instant I noted the diameter of the luminous circle by means of the divided line drawn on the card : the square of this Hh h diameter compared with the square of the diameter of the first circle , gave the ratio of the intensity of light at equal distances from the focus .

On this a thin board was contrived to slide easily at right angles , and the rod moving stiffly in the joint , could be set to any elevation so as to receive the light reflected from the mirror on the thin board .
The board was covered with white paper divided by perpendicular lines at the distance of the tenth of an inch from each other .
The observations were then made , and the ratio of the light deduced in the same manner as in the preceding experiments .

_ Not being perfectly satisfied with the manner in which these experiments were conducted , I was anxious to devise some means of viewing the light on both sides of the focus at the same time ; and this to a certain degree I accomplished in the following manner .
I caused two small blocks of wood to be made to slide easily on the rod beforementioned , and cut in each a notch with a fine saw to receive a slip of card at right angles to the rod .
On each card a circle of half an inch in diameter was drawn which remained white , the rest of the card being painted black .
By this contrivance , I could receive on each circle a portion of the light reflected from the mirror when the slips of card were placed one within the focus , and the other without .
The one without the focus remained stationary , whilst that within was shifted till the observer pronounced the white circles to be equally illuminated , when the distance between the cards was 237 carefully measured .
At the conclusion of these observations , the card next the mirror was moved till a perfect image of the candle was formed on it , when its distance from the card beyond the focus was measured , and the mean of a number of these last observations ( differing but little from each other ) was taken , in order to ensure a more accurate result .
The distance of each card from the focus when the light was of equal intensity being thus obtained , the squares of those distances will express the relative intensity of illumination at equal distances on either side of the focus .

&lt; ,.4 ... Conceiving that some error might possibly arise from the one circle being nearer to the eye than the other , I substituted for them transparent disks of six-tenths of an inch diameter , &amp; gg made by cutting circular holes in two slips of black card paper , and covering them with fine oiled paper .
Small shades of black card paper were contrived to shield the disks from the direct rays of the candle .
The disk within the focus being made the brightest , was moved at intervals towards the mirror till the observer pronounced both disks to be equally illuminated , when their distance was registered as the " first reading .
" The disk within the focus was then advanced so near the mirror , as to appear much the faintest , and afterwards brought back gradually till the illumination of the disks was a second time pronounced to be equal , when their distance was again measured and entered under the head of " second reading , " and the same method was followed in all the subsequent experiments .

Care was taken to place the di'sks as near the axis of the mirror as was possible without their interfering with each other .

'Two lamps were procured , and the wicks being trimmed so that the flames appeared of an equal size , one lamp was placed 16 feet from the mirror , and the other 4 feet , which last distance , as will be seen , was varied in the course of the experiments .
Two small disks of card paper a quarter of an inch in diameter , supported on wires , were fixed on one of the sliders , one inch and three quarters from each other , and both at the same distance from the mirror .
The slider being placed between the two foci of the lamps , they were arranged so that the reflected light from the most distant lamp fell on one of the disks after the rays had crossed at the focus , and that from the nearest lamp was received by the other disk before the rays arrived at the focus .
The slider was then moved between the foci till the disks appeared equally illuminated , when the division ( the rod being divided into inches and tenths ) cut by the slider was registered .
The slider was then moved till a well defined image of the furthest lamp appeared on the disk , and the division cut by the slider being noted , the distance of the disks , when equally illuminated , from the focus of the furthest lamp was readily obtained .
The foci of the two lamps being calculated , tleir differetce was known , and by means of it , and the distance of the disks from the focus of the furthest lamp , their distance from the focus of the Ytearest lamp was determined .
The mean of several readings was in every instance taken to insure a more accurate result , and the lamps were changed during each experiment , in order to obviate any error which might arise from the inequality of their light .
The rays from the distant lamp were first thrown on the right hand disk , and in the subsequent series on the left ; by which the error arising from any shade of difference in the disks ( if such existed ) was corrected .

The preceding method of determining the proportional intensity of light without the focus to that within , is not much to be relied upon , from the circumstance of the light after it has crossed at the focus appearing of a deeperyellow colour than before , which renders it extremely difficult to decide when the disks are equally illumninated ; the circle of light ; too , from the furthest lamp being very small so near the focus , and its illumination uneqtual in different parts , forms another source of error ; from these objections , however , I must observe , the experiments made within both foci are in a great measure exempt .
With respect to the experiments detailed in the preceding part of this paper , it may be remarked in their favour , that the observations were made by eight different persotns at various times , and by diffitrent methods , and that the near coincidence of the results with each other , and with the numbers deduced from the experiments made with the Cassegrainian and Gregorian telescopes , seem to warrant the conclusion that a mean of the whole may be considered as a tolerable approximation to the truth , London , April o2 , 1814 .
