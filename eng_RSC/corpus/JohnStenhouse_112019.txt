" Continiuation of all Examination of Rubia munjista , the EastIndian Madder , or Mlunjeet of Commerce .
" By JOHN STENIIOUSE , LL. D. , F.R.S. Received December 21 , 1863 * .
In the former , preliminary notice of the examination of the Ruiba munjista Jr , the mode of extracting munijistine from munjeet , and a number of its properties , have been already described .
I now proceed to detail some results which have been subsequently obtained .
When munjistine is extracted from munjeet by boiling solutions of sulphate of alumina , as the whole of the colouring matter is not extracted by a single treatment with the sulphate of alumina , the operation must be repeated five or six times instead of two or three as was formerly stated .
During the boiling of the munijeet with sulphate of alumina , a large quantity of furfurol is given off .
I may mention , in passing , that the most abundant and economical source of furfurol is found in the preparation of garancine by boiling madder with sulphuric acid .
If the wooden boilers in which garancine is usually manufactured were fitted with condensers , furfurol might be obtained in any quantity without expense .
In addition to the properties of munjistine already described , I may mention that acetate of copper produces in solutions of munjistine a brown precipitate but very slightly soluble in acetic acid .
When brominie-water is added to a strong aqueous solution of munjistinie , a pale-coloured flocculent precipitate is immediately produced ; this when collected on a filter , washed and dissolved in hot alcohol , furniishes minute tufts of crystals , evidently a substitution-product .
Unfortunately these crystals are contaminated by a resinous matter , from which I have been unable to free them , and therefore to determine their composition .
When munjistine is strongly heated on platinum-foil , it readily ilnflames and leaves no residue ; when it is carefully heated in a tube , it fuses , and crystallizes againi on cooling .
If heated very slowly in a Mohr 's apparatus , munjistine sublimes in golden scales and broad flat needles of great beauty ; these have all the physical characters and the same composition as the original substance .
If the sublimation be continued for a lonig time at the lowest possible temperature consistent with its volatilization , the whole of it is obtained with scarcely any loss .
The following are the results of the ultimate analysis of different samples of munjistine : I. *314 grm. of munjistine yielded 732 grm. carbonic acid and 106 grm. of water .

Lead !
Compound .
When aqueous or alcoholic solutions of munjistine and acetate of lead are mixed , a flocculent precipitate of a deep orange-colour falls , which changes to scarlet on the addition of a slig , ht excess of acetate .
The best method of preparing it is to dissolve munjistine in hot spirit and add to the filtered solution a quantity of acetate of lead insufficient to precipitate the whole of the munjistine , then to waslh thoroughly with spirit , in which the lead compound is but slightly soluble , and dry first in vacuo , and then in the water-bath .

All the specimens were prepared at different times , except IV .
and V. , which are analyses of the same specimen .
The lead compound therefore seems to approach nearly to the somewhat anomalous formula 5 ( C , , H , 0 , ) + 6PbO , being a basic lead-salt ; it is , however , perfectly analogous to the lead compound of purpurine , 5(C01 H5 O ) + 6PbO , described by Wolff and Strecker* .
From these analyses of the lead compound and also from the ultimate analyses of munjistine itself , it is pretty evident that its true formula is C06 116 06 .
Neither sublimed munjistine nor that obtained by crystallization from alcohol , when dried at the ordinary temperature in vacuo , loses weight at 1100 C. It is not improbable , however , that the gelatinous uncrystallizable precipitate , which separates on the cooling of boiling saturated aqueous solutions of munjistine , is a hydrate .
From some experiments made on a considerable scale , I find that ordinary madder does not contain any munjistine .
In order to ascertain this fact , a considerable quantity of garancine from Naples Roots , and likewise some which had been subjected to the action of high-pressure steam according to Pincoff and Schunek 's process , were treated with boiling bisulphide of carbon , and the product obtained on evaporating the bisulphide repeatedly extracted with large quantities of boiling water ; the solution , when acidl.lated with sulphuric acid , gave an orange-red precipitate from which I was unable to obtain any munjistine .
Professor Stokes succeeded , however , in detecting the presence of alizarine , purpurine , and rubiacine in it j. The production of phthalic acid from alizarine , purpurine , and munjistine , together with a comparison of their subjoined formule , indicates the very close relationship between these three substances , the only true colouring principles of the different species of madder with which we are acquainted .

Two other very convenient sources of phthalic acid are-first , the dark red resinous matter , combined with alumina , which is left undissolved by the bisulphide of carbon in the preparation of munjistine ; secondly , the large quantity of green-coloured resinous matter which remains behind after extracting the alizarine from Professor Kopp 's so-called " green alizarine " by means of bisulphide of carbon .
I have repeated Marignac 's and Schunck 's experiments of distilling a mixture of phthalic acid and lime ; and , like both of these chemists , I observed a quantity of very aromatic benzol to be produced , which , by the action of strong nitric acid , readily yielded nitrobenzol , and from this , by the action of reducing agents , aniline .
The only impurity in the benzol from phthalic acid appears to be a minate quantity of an oil , having an aromatic odour , resembling that produced from cinnamic acid by the action of hypochlorite of lime .
Tinetorial power of Munjidtine and Mtvjeet .
Prof. Rung stated , in 1835 , that munjeet contains twice as much avail-able colouring matter as the best Avignoni madder .
This result was so unexpected , that the Prussian Society for the Encouragement of Manufactures , to whom Professor Runge 's memoir was originally addressed , referred the matter to three eminent German dyers , Messrs. Dannenberger , B6hm , and Nobiling .
These gentlemen reported , as the result of numerous and carefully conducted experiments , that so far from minjeet being richer in colouringmatter than ordinary madder , it contained considerably less .
This conclusion has been confirmed by the experience of my friend Mr. John Thom , of Birkacre , near Clhorley , one of the most skilful of the Lancashire printers .
From a numerous series of experimenits I have just completed , I find that the garancine from munjeet has about half the tinctorial power of the garancine made from the best madder , viz. Naples Roots .
These , however , yield only about 30 to 33 per cent. of garancine , while mnunjeet , according to my friend Mr. Higgill , of Maianchester , yields from 52 to 55 per cent. Taking the present prices therefore of madder at 36 shillings per cwt .
, and munjeet at 30 shillings , it will be foun-id that there will be scarcely any pecuniary advantage in using muinjeet for ordinary madder-dyeing .
The colours from munjeet are certainly brighter , but not so durable as those from madder , owing to the substitution of purpurine for alizarine .
There is , however , great reason to believe that some of the Turkey-re d dyers are employing garancine from munjeet to a considerable extent .
When this is the case they'evideiitly sacrifice fastness to brilliancy of colour .
By treating such a garancine with boiling water , and precipitating by an acid in the way already described , its sophistication with mulnjeet may very readily be detected .
The actual amount of colouring matter in munjeet and the best madder is very nearly the same ; but the inferiority of munijeet as a dyestuff results from its containing only the comparatively feeble colouring matters , purpurine and munijistinie , only a small portion of the latter being useful , whilst the presence of muunjistine in large quantity appears to be positively inijurious .
So nauch is this the case , that when the greater part of the munijistine is removed from munjeet-garancine by boilinrg water , it yields much richer shades with aluimilna mordarnts than before .
PURPUREINE .
Action of A , mmonia on Purpurine .
When puirpurine is dissolved in dilute ammonia and exposed to the air in a vessel with a wide mouth in a warm place for about a month , ammonia and water being added , from time to time as they evaporate , the purpurine almost entirely disappears , whilst a new colouring-matter is formed which dyes unmordanted silk and wool of a fine rose-colour , but is incapable of yeing vegetable fabrics mordanted with alumina .
If , however , qtrOD]g ammonia be employed to dissolve the purpurine , considerable heat is produced-a rise of temperature of as much as 20 ?
C. taking place if the bulb of a thermometer be immersed in finely divided purpurine and strong ammonia poured on it .
The purpurine employed in these experiments was prepared by Kopp 's process , and I am indebted for it to my friend Professor Crace Calvert .
The solution of the new substance , purpureine , is filtered to separate dust , &amp;c. , as well as a black substance insoluble in dilute amnmonia ; it is them added to a considerable quantity of dilute sulphuric acid , boiled for a short time , and allowed to cool .
When cold , the impure purpureine is collected on a filter , well washed , and dissolved in a small quantity of hot alcohol .
The spirituous solution is again filtered into a quantity of very dilute boiling sulphuric acid , about 1 part acid to from 50 to 100 of water ; when cold , the precipitate is collected and again well washed .
A crystallization ouLt of boiling very diluite acid now renders it quite pure .
This somewhat long and tedious process is necessary to free it from an uncrystallizable black substance , a part of which is separated when the crude purpureine is dissolved in alcohol , and a part is left behind at the last crystallization .
This compound being in its mode of formation and physical properties very analogous to orceine , I have called it purpureine .
When crystallized by the spontaneous evaporation of its alcoholic solution , or from boiling dilute sulphuric acid under peculiar conditions of aggregation , it presents a fine iridescent green colour by reflected light ; whilst under the microscope it appears as fine long needles of a very deep crimson colour .
As obtained by the process above described , it has , however , but little of the iridescent appearance , being of a browniish-red colour with a faint tinge of green .
It is almost insoluble in cold dilute acids , and is in great part precipitated from its aqueous solution by common salt , thus greatly resembling orceine .
It is almost insoluble in bisulphide of carbon , very slightly so both in ether and in cold water , much more so in hot , and very soluble in spirit both hot and cold and in water rendered slightly alkaline .
It isreadily soluble in cold concentrated sulplhuric acid , and is precipitated unialtered by water ; on heating , however , it is destroyed .
Its aqueous solution gives a deep-red precipitate with chloride of zinc ; with chloride of mercutry a purple gelatinous precipitate ; and with nitrate of silver a precipitate of a very dark brown colour slightly soluble in ammonia .
I have been favoured with the following optical examination by Professor Stokes : " Its solutions show bands of absorption just like purpurine in c1aracteer , but in some cases considerably dtifferent in position .
The ethereal and acidulated ( acetic acid ) alcoholic solutions show this strongly .
The tint is so different in purpurinie and its derivative , that the intimate connexion revealed by the prism would be lost by the eye .
A drawing of the spectrum for purpurine would serve for its derivative ( purpureiine ) , if the bands were simply pushed a good deal nearer the red end .

Nitropurpureine .
When purpureine is dissolved in a small quantity of moderately strong nitric acid , spec , grav .
about 1'35 , and heated to 100 ?
C. , it gives off red fumes , and on being allowed to cool , a substance senarates in magnificent scarlet -prisms somewhat like chromate of silver , only of a brighter colour ; it is quite insoluble in water , ether , and bisuilphide of carbon , and very slightly soluble in spirit , but soluble in hot moderately strong nitric acid , from which it separates on standing for a considerable time .
If boiled with strong nitric acid , it is slowly decomposed .
When heated , it deflagrates : from this circumstance , and considering its mode of formation , it is evidently a nitro-substitution compound ; I have therefore called it nitropurpureine .
Owing to the small quaintity which I have hitherto been able to procure , I have not yet determined the composition of this beautiful body , which is finer in appearance than any of the derivatives from madder I have as yet met with .
Action of Ammonia on Alizvarine .
The alizarine which was employed for the subjoined experiments was obtained by extracting Professor E. Kopp 's so-called green alizarine* with bisulphide of carbon .
It yields only about 15 per cent. of orange-red alizarine .
This was crystallized three times out of spirit , from which it usually separates as a deep-orange-coloured crystalline powder .
Unfortunately this alizarine still contains a quantity of purpurine , from which it is impossible to purify it either by crystallization or sublimation .
Accordingly , when treated with ammonia by the method already described for purpurine , while it yields a substance analogous to purmureine , the product is impure , being contaminated with purpureine , This mixture has been examined by mry friend Professor Stokes , who finds that it contains purpureine , derived from the purpurine present as an impurity in the alizarine employed , and another substance very like alizarine in its optical properties , probably a new substance ( alizareine ) , bearing the same relation to alizarine that purpureine does to purpurine** The following is an extract from a letter I received from Professor Stokes : " It would be very unlikely a ' priori that such a simple process as that of Kopp should effect a perfect separation of two such similar bodies as alizarine and purpurine ; and as I find his purpurine is free from alizarine , it would be almost certain a priori that his ' green alizarine ' would contain purptirine , and the two would be dissolved by bisulphide of carbon , and might very well afterwards be associated by being deposited in intermingled crystals , if not actually crystallizing together .
" Action of Ammonia on Munjistine .
This reaction with munjistine was only tried on a very small scale , but the results were by no means satisfactory .
The munjistine was completely destroyed , the greater part being changed into a brown humus-like substance , insoluble in ammonia , the remainder forming a colouring-substance , analogous to purpureine , but not crystalline .
It dyed unmordanted silk a brownish-orange colour .
The combined action of ammonia and oxygen , therefore , on the three colouring-substances alizarine , purpurine , and munjistine , is to change them from adjective to substantive dye-stuffs .
I think it not improbable that if this archilizing process were applied to various other colouring matters , they would be found capable of undergoing similar transformations .
Action of Bromine on Alizarine .
A boiling saturated solution of alizarine in alcohol is mixed with about six or eight parts of distilled water , and to this when cold about one or one and a half parts of bromine water are added , when a bright yellow amorphous precipitate is produiced .
After standing twelve or sixteen hours , the solution is filtered ; and if the clear filtrate be now carefully heated so as to expel the spirit , a substance of a deep orange-colour is deposited , consisting of very fine needles , which are contaminated with a small quantity of resin if a great excess of bromine has been employed .
These needles are soluble in spirit and ether , insoluble in water , and soluble in bisulphide of carbon , from which they crystallize by spontaneous evaporation , in dark-brown nodules .
With soda they give the same purple colour as alizarine .
They dye cloth mordanted with alumina a dingy brownish red , very different from the colour produced by ordinary crystallized alizarine .
The following optical examination is from a letter of Professor Stokes : " Bromine Derivative of Alizarine .
" " I can hardly distinguish this substance from alizarine .
The solutions in alcohol containing potassa show three bands of absorption just alike in appearance .
By measurement it seemed probable that the bromine substance gave the balnds a little nearer to the red end ; but the difference , if real , was very minute .
The fluorescent light of the ethereal solution was , I think , a trifle yellower in the bromine substance , that of alizarine being more orange .

680 100 00 From this somewhat anomalous formula , C60 H16 Br2 018=C20 116 06 2(C20 11 BrO6 ) , I was for some time inclined to think that it might be a mixture of brominated alizarine with free alizarine ; but as all the six samples analyzed were prepared at different times , it is highly improbable that such uniform analytical results could be obtained if they were from a mere admixture of substances .
The existelnce of a brominated compound is also confirmed by its dyeing properties , which differ so remarkably from those of alizarine .
Action of Bromine on Purpurine .
When pure purpurinie is dissolved in spirit mixed with a considerable quantity of water , and an aqueous solution of bromine added , as in the case of alizarine , a yellow amorphous precipitate is produced .
