" ( Researches on the Hydrocarbons of the Series C , H2ls+2 .
" By C. SCIORLEMMER , Esq. , Assistant in the Laboratory of Owens College , Manchester .
Communicated by Prof. H. E. RoscoE , F.R.S. Received March 21 , 1865 .
Previously to the year 1848 none of the members of the numerous family of hydrocarbons of the general formula C , H2 , +2 , with the single exception of marsh-gas , were known to the chemist ; but since that year the researches of Kolbe on the electrolysis of the fatty acids , and those of Frankland on the action of zinc upon the alcohol iodides , have opened up a new field of discovery , from which in rapid succession rich harvests have been reaped .
The hydrocarbons thus isolated were considered by their discoverers to be the true radicals of the alcohols ; and in consequence the molecular weights which were then given to these bodies amounted only to half those which are now generally accepted .
164 [ April 6 , In their Report to the Paris Academy upon these hydrocarbons , Laurent and Gerhardt proposed that their formulae should be doubled , because these bodies , if represented by the smaller formulae , would in the gaseous state occupy two volumes instead of the four volumes in which the molecule of all other organic compounds was found to occur ; and they considered these bodies as homologues of marsh-gas .
Hofmann afterwards expressed himself in favour of the larger formulae on the same grounds , and also because , if Frankland 's and Kolbe 's formulae are accepted , the increase in the boiling-point produced by an increase of CH , in the hydrocarbon would be double that which has been observed as the difference in the boiling-points of other homologous series .
Besides these radicals , Frankland discovered another series of hydrocarbons , which , according to the mode of their formation , he regarded as the hydrides of the radicals , and as the true homologues of marsh-gas , and which , according to a view first propounded by Brodie , are considered to stand in a similar relation to the radical hydrocarbons as alcohol stands to ether , viz. Hydride of ethyl .

HJf C2H5 C2H Brodie anticipated the existence of mixed radicals , as ethyl-amyl , Cr ' P , TT~ , 1 NIWlia~ 5 Hin bearing the same relation to the simple radical , p rI5 , as Williamson 's mixed ether , 215 to c n , C2 r1 [ 0 .
The researches of h flly l2 da Wurtz have fully realized this anticipation .
Wurtz discovered a new method of preparing the alcohol radicals by the action of sodium upon the iodides ; and according to this method he not only obtained the hydrocarbons discovered by Kolbe and Frankland , but , by employing two different iodides , he prepared a number of mixed radicals , which he also obtained by the electrolysis of a mixture of two fatty acids .
The results of Wurtz 's investigation have always been regarded as a convincing proof of the correctness of Brodie 's view , and it is now generally believed that two series of hydrocarbons of the formula C , , 12 , +2 exist , the hydrides and the radicals , the molecule of the latter containing two atoms of the real radicals which are supposed to exist in the alcohols .
A very remarkable resemblance is observed in the general physical properties of the two series , the members of which are gases or liquids so indifferent as to resist even the action of concentrated sulphuric or nitric acids , This resemblance is so great that Greville Williams was led to the opinion that the indifferent hydrocarbons which he discovered in the oils obtained in the destructive distillation of Boghead coal belonged to the series of the radicals , although he observed some differences in their physical properties .
The chemical behaviour of the radicals has been very imperfectly studied , all experiments having failed which were carried out with the view of obtaining from a radical either the alcohol from which it was derived , or the corresponding acid ; whilst , by the action of chlorine , only substitution-products had been formed , in which 2 or 4 atoms of hydrogen are replaced by chlorine .
The action of chlorine upon the hydrides had also been studied .
Dumas showed that by acting upon marsh-gas , as first substitution-product the compound CH3 C1 was formed .
Berthelot proved that this body was chloride of methyl , by converting it into methyl-alcohol and other methylcompounds .
From hydride of ethyl Frankland and Kolbe obtained the compound C2 H5 Cl , which , however , appeared to them not to be identical , but only isomeric with chloride of ethyl .
During the last few years , however , our knowledge of the hydrides has become much more complete .
Pelouze and Cahours discovered the whole series , from hydride of butyl upwards , in the American petroleum ; Greville Williams proved the existence of hydride of amyl in the oils from Boghead coal , from which he inferred that the hydrocarbons formerly described as radicals were really hydrides ; and I found the same hydrocarbons in the products of the destructive distillation of Cannel-coal .
From these researches it appears that the reaction by which Berthelot had obtained methyl-compounds from marsh-gas is a general one , and that from each hydride the corresponding chloride , the alcohol , and al their derivatives can be prepared .
Whilst pursuing the investigation of the hydrides , I was struck by their close resemblance to the isomeric terms of the radical series , and I thought it might be possible that the opinion held by Laurent and Gerhardt was , after all , the correct one , and that the so-called radicals belonged really to the marsh-gas hydrocarbons .
Moreover Wurtz , by acting on zinc-ethyl with iodide of ally ] , had obtained the mixed radical ethyl-allyl , C j}j C 1I , , which has not only 35 the composition , but all the characteristic properties of amylene , and Beilstein and Rieth had effected the synthesis of propylene and amylene by the action of zinc-ethyl upon chloroform .
Might not the synthesis of the alcohol radicals be a synthesis of the same kind ?
Or , if hydrides and radicals are really different , what is this difference ?
In order to solve this question I endeavoured to try if I could replace in a radical hydrocarbon 1 atom of hydrogen by chlorine , in order to compare these products and their derivatives with the chlorides and other derivatives obtained from the hydrides .
As a starting-point I selected the mixed radical ethyl-amyl , because this hydrocarbon may easily be obtained in sufficient quantity , and because I 166 [ April 6 , had previously carefully studied the hydride of heptyl and its derivatives .
In the preparation of ethyl-amyl a considerable quantity of the radical amyl is always formed , the behaviour of which with chlorine I also investigated .
The first results of these researches have been published in the 'Journal of the Chemical Society , ' vol. i. ( new ser. ) p. 425 .
I obtained the chlorides C7 Ii1 Cl and C0 H21 C1 , which appeared to be identical with the chlorides of heptyl and of decatyl .
The next step was to ascertain how the lower terms of the two series are acted upon by chlorine , and to study closely the differences which were stated to exist between methyl and hydride of ethyl .
The results which I obtained were , however , quite different from those of former observers .
I found that when equal volumes of chlorine and of methyl , and equal volumes of chlorine and hydride of ethyl , are exposed to the diffused daylight , the principal product of the reaction consists in both cases of the compound C , HI Cl , a body having the composition and characteristic properties of chloride of ethyl , and as neither in the physical nor in the chemical properties of the two hydrocarbons a difference is known to exist , I concluded that methyl and hydride of ethyl are identical .
It appeared very probable that the same relation might exist in the case of the higher terms of the two series , which , however , showed some differences in their physical properties , and I left it an open question whether there is only one series of hydrocarbons , C , ,H2+2 , or whether two series exist which exhibit the characters of physical isomerism .
The following communication contains the results of researches carried out for the purpose of deciding the above question in the case of the hydrocarbons ethyl-amyl and hydride of heptyl , and of amyl and hydride of decatyl .
The results of this investigation are in some respect not so complete as I could desire .
The chief difficulty in working upon this subject is the very small yield of the alcohol of the series which is obtained from a proportionally large quantity of the hydrocarbon , the alcohol being certainly that compound by the study of which and of its derivatives much light would be thrown on many still obscure points .
Only , in the most favourable cases , one-third of the theoretical yield of the chloride is obtained ; and in preparing the acetate from the chloride a large quantity of the latter is decomposed into olefine and hydrochloric acid , and this decomposition increases as the compounds become richer in carbon .
Thus a small fraction of the hydrocarbon is converted into the acetate ; and in order to prepare from this ether the pure anhydrous alcohol , losses are unavoidable , which diminish considerably the yield of a pure product .
I have tried in different ways to obtain other compound ethers from the chloride , or to convert it into the iodide , without finding a better method than that originally employed , to which therefore I finally returned .
The specific gravities given in the following account are compared with water at 4 ?
C. , or they give the weight of one cubic centimetre in grammes ; the boiling-points are provided with the necessary correction for the mercurial column above the vapour .
I. Heptyl Compounads .
The ethyl-amyl which is obtained by acting upon a mixture of the iodides of ethyl and amyl with sodium contains generally traces of ethylether and ethyl-amyl-ether , the formation of which is easily explained by the presence of traces of moisture and amyl-alcohol , both of which can be completely excluded only with difficulty .
In order to remove these ethers , I treated the crude ethyl-amyl , from which , by fractional distillation , the amyl was as much as possible separated , and which boiled between 70 ?
120 ?
C. , with a mixture of concentrated nitric and sulphuric acids , by which not only the ethers , but also traces of iodides , which obstinately adhere , are removed .
By washing with water , drying over caustic potash , and rectification over sodium , pure ethyl-amyl was obtained as a light mobile liquid possessing a faint ethereal odour which cannot be distinguished from that of hydride of heptyl .
It boils at 90 ?
-910 C. , and has the specific gravity 0'6819 at 17 ?
` 5 C. The boiling-point of the hydride of heptyl I have formerly stated as 98 ?
C. , whilst Pelouze and Cahours give it as 920-94 ?
C. I have lately convinced myself that the latter observation is the more correct one .
The boiling-point of this hydrocarbon becomes lowered after being repeatedly treated with a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids , by which traces of nitro-compounds of the benzol series of hydrocarbons are removed , which obstinately adhere ' , , .
Mr. Ch. R. Wright continued the fractional distillation of the hydride , which was very well purified in the above manner for a long time .
In the beginning of these rectifications , the largest quantity of the liquid distilled between 95 ?
-100 ?
, whilst always a small quantity with a boiling-point above * Pelouze and Cahours state that the American petroleum which they used did not contain hydrocarbons of the benzol series , whilst I found a not inconsiderable quantity of these compounds in the rectified petroleum from which I isolated the hydrides .
As it was not impossible that this was an accidental or intentional admixture , I endeavoured to procure some genuine crude American petroleum ; but I did not succeed in obtaining crude genuine Pennsylvanian , as none of it had reached the Liverpool market for months .
I however got some real Canadian rock-oil , as a thick black liquid of a very unpleasant odour .
I distilled it , and treated the portion boiling below 150 ?
C. with concentrated nitric acid , which acted violently .
The acid liquid was then diluted with water , and heavy liquid nitro-compounds separated , possessing the odour of bitter almonds .
These were treated with tin and hydrochloric acid , and the solution thus obtained was distilled with caustic potash .
The aqueous distillate , in which some drops of an oily liquid were suspended , had the odour of aniline , and gave with a solution of bleaching-powder the most distinct aniline-reaction .
The beautifuil rosaniline-reaction could also easily be obtained by heating one of the oily drops with bichloride of mercury .
Canadian petroleum contains therefore the series of benzol hydrocarbons .
In the preparation of hydride of decatyl from rectified petroleum , the portion boiling between 150 ?
-170 ?
was purified by nitric and sulphuric acids , and thus liquid and solid nitro-compounds obtained .
The solid portion was several times recrystallized from alcohol , and the whole of the needle-shaped crystals thus obtained gave on analysis numbers very nearly agreeing with the formula of trinitro-cumol , Cg Hg ( NO2)3 .
168 [ April 6 , 100 ?
was left behind .
As soon as such a residue ceased to be observed , the distillates were collected at intervals of 3 ?
, and thus at last by far the largest quantity was found to boil constantly between 900-92 ? .
Whilst , however , the boiling-point was lowered , no change in the specific gravity was observed .
The hydride ofheptyl boiling at 90 ?
-92 ?
has the specific gravity 0-7148 at 15 ?
, whilst that boiling at 98 ?
gave the specific gravity 0-7149 at 15 ?

3'45 3-46 If a current of chlorine is passed into these hydrocarbons in diffused daylight , the gas is completely absorbed for some time , and the liquid assumes a yellow colour ; however , suddenly it becomes heated , torrents of hydrochloric acid are evolved , and the colour of the chlorine disappears , and from this point the chlorine acts quietly , and hydrochloric acid is continuously evolved .
If a little iodine has been added , the action continues in the dark , but higher chlorinated products are more easily formed .
If 100-200 grammes of the hydrocarbon have been employed , the current of chlorine must be interrupted after some hours , and the liquid treated with solid caustic potash to remove the absorbed hydrochloric acid .
The nonattacked hydrocarbon is then separated by distillation from the chlorinated product , and the former treated repeatedly with chlorine , until all the Hydrocarbons the hydrocarbon has been acted upon .
The product is then subjected to fractional distillation , in order to isolate the pure chloride C7 H5 C1 .
The chloride of heptyl derived from ethyl-amyl boils at 146 ?
-148 ?
, and has the specific gravity 0'8814 at 16 ?
'5 .
The chloride from the hydride has the boiling-point 148 ?
-150 ?
, and the specific gravity 0-9030 at 15 ?
; the chloride from another preparation boiled at 147 ?
-149 ?
, and its specific gravity was found to be 0'8965 at 19 ? .
By heating these chlorides in sealed glass tubes with acetate of potassium and glacial acetic acid to 160 ?
-180 ?
, chloride of potassium separates out , and heptylene and acetate of heptyl are formed .
The point at which all the chloride has been decomposed can easily be recognized as follows : Two layers of liquid are observed in the heated tube , the lower one consisting of a concentrated solution of acetate of potassium in acetic acid , and the upper one of chloride of heptyl with some acetic acid .
Where these two layers meet , a separation of chloride of potassium takes place , and the crystals thus formed fall gradually through the lower part of the tube .
As soon as this separation of the salt at the junction of the two layers ceases , the operation is finished .
The contents of the tube are now diluted with water , the light liquid which separates is well washed , dried over chloride of calcium , and from this liquid heptylene and acetate of heptyl are separated by fractional distillation .
The heptylene derived from ethyl-amyl , after repeated rectifications over sodium , was obtained as a colourless mobile liquid of a faint garlic-like odour , boiling at 93 ?
-95 ?
, and having the specific gravity 0'7060 at 12 ?

; but even after repeated distillations the boilingpoint always rises to about 100 ?
towards the end of the operation .
Its specific gravity was found to be 0 7383 at 17 ?

I may here remark that all the compounds derived from the hydride which are mentioned in this paper are those formerly described ( Journ. Chem. Soc. vol. i. new series , p. 216 ) , being prepared from the hydrocarbon boiling at 98 ? .
The boiling-point of the liquid from which the heptylene has been separated rises quickly above 170 ?
, and at 180 ?
it becomes constant , when pure acetate of heptyl distils over , giving on analysis the following results:0-2015 substance gave 0'5055 carbonic acid and 0-2090 water .

The former boils at 178 ?

'5 , whilst the boiling-point of the latter was found as 179 ?
-1810 , and the specific gravity 0-8868 at 19 ? .
This ether is easily decomposed when heated with a concentrated solution of caustic potash ; heptyl-alcohol is formed , which , when dried over chloride of calcium , and treated with a small piece of sodium , in order to remove the last traces of moisture , was found to boil at 163 ?
-165 ? .
Its odour much resembles that of the hexyl-alcohol , but also reminds one of octyl-alcohol from castor-oil .
The specific gravity is 0'8291 at 16 ?

The odour of the latter is very similar to the alcohol from ethyl-amyl , but less pure , as if the true odour was interfered with by that of some other substance .

16 1 3-8 1403 0 ... ... ... ... 16 13-8 116 100'0 Both alcohols dissolve easily in concentrated sulphuric acid : the mixture becomes hot and assumes a dark colour .
After standing for some hours , a small quantity of tarry matter separates out on dilution with water , the clear liquid containing a sulpho-acid in solution , together with the excess of sulphuric acid .
This mixture was neutralized with carbonate of barium , the liquid filtered , and evaporated to dryness in a water-bath .
The dry residue was treated with water , and a barium salt dissolved , which however I did not succeed in obtaining crystallized from either of the alcohols , as the solutions , evaporated both in the water-bath and over sulphuric acid , yielded a thick syrupy liquid , drying slowly to a gum-like mass , in which no crystals could be detected , and which readily formed with the smallest quantity of water and alcohol clear solutions , which again , by spontaneous evaporation , dried into a gum .
The smallness of the quantity of alcohol from ethyl-amyl at my disposal has for the present prevented me from repeating the experiment on a larger scale , which doubtless would have given a better result .
In order to obtain the oxidation products of the two alcohols , they were distilled in a small retort with a mixture of bichromate of potassium and diluted sulphuric acid .
A violent reaction occurs at first , which soon diminishes .
The distillate was shaken with a solution of carbonate of sodium , and the liquid which did not dissolve treated again several times with the oxidizing mixture , and the distillate after each treatment shaken with the solution of carbonate of sodium .

171 The solution of the sodium salt was evaporated to dryness in the waterbath , the residue distilled with diluted sulphuric acid , and the acid distillate , consisting of an aqueous liquid on which an oily layer swam , was rectified , in order to separate traces of sulphuric acid which had spirted over .
The oily acid thus obtained possesses the odour of cenanthylic acid , and consists entirely of this compound , as the following analyses of the silver-salt prove .
( a ) The acid derived from the hydride alcohol was neutralized with ammonia , and precipitated with a solution of nitrate of silver .
The white flocculent precipitate was washed with cold distilled water , and dried carefully at 100 ?

After treating the last distillate with sodium , a small quantity of an oily liquid remained undissolved , possessing the odour of cenanthol , and boiling between 150 ?

These liquids gave a crystalline magma by shaking with a concentrated solution of bisulphite of sodium , a few drops of a liquid having a pleasant smell remaining undissolved .

Decatyl Compounds .
The amyl used in these researches was purified , in order to remove traces of amyl.ether and iodide of amyl , exactly in the same manner as ethyl-amyl .
It boiled constantly at 158 ?
-159o , and had the specific gravity 0'7275 at 14 ? .
The hydride of decatyl was isolated from rectified American petroleum , afterpurifying the portion boiling between 150 ?
-170 ?
by a mixture of concentrated nitric and sulphuric acids .
It boiled at 15 7 ?
-159 ?
, and had the specific gravity 0 7461 at 14 ? .
Pelouze and Cahours found the boilingpoint of this hydrocarbon to be 160 ?
, and its specific gravity 0-735 at 15 ? .
The same hydrocarbon was found by Greville Williams in the oils from Boghead coal , and described as amyl .
He gives the boiling-point 159 ?
, and the specific gravity 0-7365 at 18 ? .
Amyl and the decatyl-hydride cannot be distinguished by their odour , which is exactly the same in the case of all the hydrides and the radical hydrocarbons , with the only difference that it is stronger the more volatile the substances are , [ April 6 , 1 7 In order to obtain the chlorides C , H121 Cl , I proceeded in the same manner as described in the preparation of chloride of heptyl .
The chloride of decatyl from amyl is a colourless mobile liquid of a pleasant , fruity smell ; it boils at 2030-205 ?
, and has the specific gravity 0'8739 at 14 ? .
The chloride prepared from hydride of decatyl boils at the same temperature , 203 ?
-205 ?
; its specific gravity is 0-898 at 16 ?

The odour of this chloride is fainter , not quite so pleasant , as if the true smell was hidden by that of some impurity .
At first it possesses a yellowish colour , as Pelouze and Cahours have already observed ; but it can be obtained quite colourless by repeated distillations , when a small qluantity of a brown residue is always left behind .
The analysis of the chloride from amyl I have already given in the previous paper ; that of the chloride from the hydride gave the following results:0-2857 substance gave 0-1938 chloride of silver and 0'0296 metallic silver .

Both compounds were separated and purified like the corresponding heptyl conpounds .

16 10-13 158 100-00 The alcohols and acetates were burnt with oxide of copper alone , without a current of oxygen , and this will account for the loss in carbon .
Unfortunately I obtained these alcohols in small quantity only , and I am , therefore , obliged to postpone for the present the investigation of their derivatives .
Both dissolve easily in concentrated sulphuric acid ; but I did not succeed in obtaining either of the sulpho-salts in the crystallized state .
I have not yet studied the products of oxidation of these alcohols .
From the above researches I conclude that no difference exists in the chemical behaviour of the radicals and of the hydrides ; the difference which has been observed in the physical properties , as in the boilingpoints , also diminishes the better and the more closely these hydrocarbons are studied .
There are , however , differences in the specific gravities which cannot be overlooked .
The radicals as well as their derivatives have a lower specific gravity than the corresponding hydrocarbons from petroleum and their derivatives , It is , however , a well-established fact that it is im[April 6 , 174 possible to isolate pure compounds from a mixture of many homologous compounds by even repeated fractional distillations , and I have convinced myself , whilst engaged for some time upon this subject , that it is much easier to obtain one of the hydrocarbons free from homologues having lower boiling-points , than to remove the last traces of higher boiling compounds which adhere obstinately .
This is the case even , if , after repeated fractional distillations , a hydrocarbon is obtained which boils constantly between two degrees , and from it a chloride is prepared which also boils constantly between two degrees .
The acetate which is derived from this chloride distils for the most part between two degrees , but after each rectification a small quantity of a liquid , possessing a higher boiling-point , remains behind ; and if , finally , an acetate of a constant boiling-point has been obtained , the alcohol prepared from it also contains a small quantity of a substance which raises the boiling-point towards the end of the distillation .
From a constantly boiling radical , on the other hand , derivatives are obtained which have a constant boiling-point , and which are colourless ; whilst those from the hydrides have generally first a yellowish colour , and leave dark residues behind on distillation , and even if they are obtained colourless , after several rectifications , they generally darken again after some time , and brown flakes separate out .
These observations , as well as the unpleasant odour which all the compounds derived from the hydrocarbons from petroleum possess , prove that they contain impurities which will certainly tend to raise the specific gravities .
Moreover , Dale has shown that the hydrocarbons obtained from the acids of the series C , H11_2 04 also have a much lower specific gravity than the corresponding petroleum hydrocarbons .
Hence it appears highly probable that only one series of hydrocarbons of theformula C , H , ,+2 exists .
Hydride of ethyl and ethyl are compounds possessing quite an analogous constitution , and they cannot be fairly compared with alcohol and ether , in which two groups C2 H , and H , and C2 H5 , C211 , are separated by an oxygen atom , whilst in the hydrocarbons all the carbon atoms are united together in exactly the same manner , and thus only one graphical representation of these bodies is possible* .
If , however , as the identity of the two series has not yet been strictly proved , the view should be preferred that isomeric hydrocarbons exist , we are compelled to admit also that isomeric chlorides , compound ethers , alcohols , and olefines exist , as these derivatives of the hydrocarbons show exactly the same differences as are found in the hydrocarbons themselves , and all these bodies must then have to be considered as absolutely isomeric .
The cause of the isomerism so often observed in compounds belonging to the aromatic series , as well as the cause of homology in these bodies , has been much elucidated by the beautiful researches of Fittig on the benzol hydrocarbons .
IHe believes that similar relations to those which he has found for the aromatic series exist between the marsh-gas hydrocarbons and the alcohol radicals* .
But Fittig 's isomeric hydrocarbons belong to the class of metamers having a different chemical structure t , whilst only one kind of structure can be given for the saturated hydrocarbons of the formula C. , H-2 +2 .
I am still pursuing these researches , and hope soon to obtain more definite results .
