Fifth Memnoir upon Quantics .
BY ARTHUR CAYLEY , Esq. , F.R.S. Received February 11 , -Read March 18 , 1858 .
THE present memoir was originally intended to contain a development of the theories of the covariants of certain binary quantics , viz. the quadric , the cubic , and the quartic ; but as regards the theories of the cubic and the quartic , it was found necessary to consider the case of two or more quadrics , and I have therefore comprised such systems of two or more quadrics , and the resulting theories of the harmonic relation and of involution , in the subject of the memoir ; and although the theory of homography or of the anharmonic relation belongs rather to the subject of bipartite binary quadrics , yet from its connexion with the theories just referred to , it is also considered in the memoir .
The paragraphs are numbered continuously with those of my former memoirs on the subject : Nos. 92 to 95 relate to a single quadric ; Nos. 96 to 114 to two or more quadrics , and the theories above referred to ; Nos. 115 to 127 to the cubic , and Nos. 128 to 145 to the quartic .
The several quantics are considered as expressed not only in terms of the coefficients , but also in terms of the roots , and I consider the question of the determination of their linear factors , -a question , in effect , identical with that of the solution of a quadric , cubic , or biquadratic equation .
The expression for the linear factor of a quadric is deduced from a well-known formula ; those for the linear factors of a cubic and a quartic were first given in my " ' Note sir les Covariants d'une fonction quadratique , cubique ou biquadratique 'a deux indeterminees , " CRELLE , Vol. L. pp. 285 to 287 , 1855 .
It is remarkable that they are in one point of view more simple than the expression for the linear factor of a quadric .
92 .
In the case , of a quadric the expressions considered are ( a , b , 'cIX , Y ) , ( 1 ) ac-b2 , ( 2 ) where ( 1 ) is the quadric , and ( 2 ) is the discriminant , which is also the quadrinvariant , catalecticant , and Hessian .
And where it is convenient to do so , I write ( 1 ) =U , ( 2 ) = j. 93 .
We have v cta f te di n is ey)a t =Uc which expresses that the evectant of the discriminant i 's equal to the quadric ; ( a , be cpy iV)2u =4 aEl which expresses that the provectant of the quadric is equal to the discriminant ; ( a , b , ejbx + ey7-.ax by ) =E BUM which expresses that a transmutant of the quadric is equal to the product of the quadric and the discriminant .
94 .
When the quadric is expressed in terms of the roots , we have a'U=(-MCy)(Q-3y ) , a-2 0 =l(Oj3)52 ; and in the case of a pair of equal roots , a'lU =(X ay ) " j '0 .
95 .
The problem of the solution of a quadratic equation -is that of finding a linear factor of the quadric .
To obtain such linear factor in a symmetrical form , it is necessary to introduce arbitrary quantities which do not really enter into the solution , and the form obtained is thus in some sort more complicated than in the like problem for a cubic or a quartic .
The solution depends on the linear transformation of the quadric viz. if we write ( a b $+b , y5 X+gy)2=(a b1 01 act y)2 ?
so that a'=(a , b , c:XX , v)2 , 6'=(a , b , cap , YXZ( , g ) , c'(a , b , fog , , ?
)29 then aIc ' b62 = b62)(Xyp)2 an equation which in a different notation is ( a , 6 , c y)2x(a , 6 , c)2X , Y)2X2(a , 6 , cbx , e ( X , Y)12= 0 ( YX-Xy)0 , in which form it is a theorem relating to the quadric and its first and second emanants .
The equation shows that ( a , b , colic , y:(X , Y ) + / c1 ( Yx Xy ) , where ( X , Y ) are treated as supernumerary arbitrary constants , is a linear factor of ( a , b , chXx , y)2 , and this is the required solution .
96 .
In the case of two quadrics , the expressions considered are ( a , b , C JX , y)2 , ( l ) ( a ' , 6 ' , c'(x , y)2 , ( 2 ) ac-b62 ( 3 ) ac2bb'+ca ' , ( 4 ) 0 !
.tl _ 12 X(5 ) and also , taken negatively , in the form 4(ab'a'b)(bc ' b-c ) ( ad aC)2 , which is the discriminant of the Jacobian ; and in the form 4(ac2)(a'c'b2 ) -(ac -2bb'+ca')2 , which is the discriminant of the Intermediate .
98 .
We have the following relations:(a , b , c(b'x+c'y , -a'x-b 6y)2= ( atc ' b12 ) ( a , b6 , c)X , y)2 +(a c'2bb'+ca ' ) ( a ' , V , c'(vx , y)2 , ( a ' , by c':Cx + c , -axs by )2= +(ac ' -2bb'+ca ' ) ( a , b , cXx , y)2 -(ac -b2 ) ( a ' , 6 ' , c'jwX , y)2 , and , moreover ( ac h2 , ad -2bb'+ca ' , a'c ' h'2U ' , U)2 --{(ab'db , ac ' -ac , be'-V'cAx , y)2}21 an equation , the interpretation of which will be considered in the sequel .
99 .
The most important relations which may exist between the two quadrics are First , when the connective vanishes , or ad2bb'+ca'=0 , in which case the two quadrics are said to be harmonically related : the nature of this relation will be further considered .
Secondly , when R=O , the two quadrics have in this case a common root , which is given by any of the equations , x2 2:xy : f='a R:bR:a0R =_'a : baR : bR =be'-6'c : ca'ca : ab'a'b .
The last set of values express that the Jacobian is a perfect square , and that the two roots are each equal to the common root of the two quadrics .
The preceding values of the ratios 8 2xy : y2 are consistent with each other in virtue of the assumed relation R-= 0 hence in general the functions 46aR .
beR ( )bR)a , eaRb .
1btR-bR .
a'R5 &amp; C. all of them contain the Resultant R as a factor .
It is easy to see that the Jacobian is harmonically related to each of the quadrics ; in fact we have identically a ( be-b'c)+b ( ca'c'a ) +c ( alla'b)= 0 , a'(bdb1c ) + b'(ca'c'a ) + c'(ab'a'b)= 0 , which contain the theorem in question .
4a-2 =-(a-02 4al-2 0_3 ) R =0 ( aa , )-H =(iP)($ M ) 104 .
In the case of three quadrics , of the expressions which are or might be considered , it will be sufficient to mention ( a 9 b , c B(X , Y)21l ( a ' , ' , CcIXX y)2 , ( 2 ) ( a " , bit , ctXx , Y)2 ( 3 ) a , b , c , ( 4 ) / to bi Ie a " , b " ell where ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) are the quadrics themselves , and ( 4 ) is an invariant , linear in the coefficients of each quadric .
And where it is convenient to do so , I write ( 1)- , U , ( 2 ) = U ' , ( 3 ) U " , ( 4 ) =Q .
105 .
The equation 1 =0 is , it is clear , the condition to be satisfied by the coefficients of the three quadrics , in order that there may be a syzygetic relation xU + P(U ' +VU"= 0 , or what is the same thing , in order that each quadric may be an intermediate of the other two quadrics ; or again , in order that the three quadrics may be in Involution .
Expressed in terms of the roots , the relation is 1 , c=+H , a0 ; 1 , x't+/ 3 ' , &amp; I 'd and when this equation is satisfied , the three pairs , or as it is usually expressed , the six quantities a , p ; a , [ 3 ' ; " , / 3 " , are said to be in involution , or to form an involution .
And the two perfectly arbitrary pairs as , 3 ; ae ' , P3 considered as belonging to such a system , may be spoken of as an involution .
If the two terms of a pair are equal , e. g. if os " =W/ 3"=d , then the relation is 1 , 2 , 02 =0 ; + , asiol and such a system is sometimes spoken of as an involution of five terms .
Considering the pairs ( a , 3 ) , ( a ' , [ ' ) as given , there are of course two values of 4 which satisfy the preceding equation ; and calling these 4 , and d , , , then 4 , and 4 , , are said to be the sibiconjugates of the involution ax , A ; ax ' , ( ' .
It is easy to see that d , , 4 , , are the roots of the equation H= 0 , where H is the Jacobian of the two quadrics U and U ' whose roots are ( a , ( 13 ) , ( act , 13 ' ) .
In fact , the quadric whose roots are 4 , , 4 , , is Y2 , 2yx , 2 1 , c+I , cq3 af +pf , als 1 , ds+13 ' , Mitt3 which has been shown to be the Jacobian in question .
But this may be made clearer as follows:-If we imagine that A , ( are determined in such manner that the intermediate XU+pU ' may be a perfect square , then we shall have XU+pU'-a"(x-dy)2 , where d denotes one or other of the sibiconjugates D , , 4 , , of the involution .
But the condition in order that XU+pjU ' may be a square is ( ac62 , acd-26b'+ca ' , ad'cl/ 2X , )2 ; and observing that the equation A. : ?
4 = U ' : U implies kU +uU ' =0= a"(X die )2 , it is obvious that the function ( ac-b2 , ac'-2bb'+ca ' , a'C'byl2i U , -U ) 2 must be to a factor pros equal to ( a _ y)2(X _ d4 , y)2* But we have identically ( ac-b6 , ac26bb'+ca ' , ao ' b62JU ' , U)2= { ( al a'b , ada'c , be'b'cX , y)2}2 , and we thus see that ( aOy ) , ( x-4 , ,y ) are the factors of the Jacobian .
106 .
It has been already remarked that the Jacobian is harmonically related to each of the quadrics U , U ' ; hence we see that the sibiconjugates 0S 4 , , of the involution are , 03 , at ' , 3 ' are a pair harmonically related to the pair as , ( , and also harmonically related to the pair ax ' , 13 ' , and this properly might be taken as the definition for the sibiconjugates 0d1 4 , , of an involution of four terms .
And moreover , a , ( 3 ; a ' , ( ' being given , and 4 , , 4 , , being determined as the sibiconjugates of the involution , if a"tt , ( " be a pair harmonically related to 4 , , 4 , , , then the three pairs ax , ( ; a ' , ( 3 ' ; P " ( 3will form an involution ; or what is the same thing , any three pairs ax , a3 ; ex ' , a3 ' ; ox ' , ( 3 " , each of them harmonically related to a pair 4 , , 0 , , , will be an involution , and 4 , , 4 , , will be the sibiconjugates of the involution .
107 .
In particular , if a , 3 be harmonically related to 4 , , 4 , , , then it is easy to see that 4 , , 4 , may be considered as harmonically related to I , , 4 , , , and in like manner 4 , , , 4 , , will be harmonically related to 4 , , 4 , , ; that is , the pairs 4 , , 4 , ; 4 , / , , and a , [ will form an involution .
This comes to saying that the equation 1 , 24 , 42 =0 1 , 24 , , , 02 1 , e+[ , ex[ is equivalent to the harmonic relation of the pairs 0 ?
, , 8 , , ; and in fact the determinant is ( di oi ) 2aP+2d~d , j_(as+Adj(0+d , , ) ) which proves the theorem in question .
108 .
Before proceeding further , it is proper to consider the equation 15 , A'eM'= I , 0 , 181e o1 1 , 7 , 7 , 77 1 , 8 , If , ba which expresses that the sets ( osa , , yr 6 ) and ( z ' , / ' , y ' , is ) are homographic ; for although the homographic equation may be considered as belonging to the theory of the bipartite quadric ( x -ay ) ( xc &amp; 'y ) , yet the theory of involution cannot be completely discussed except in connexion with that of homography .
If we write A ' ( I ' y')( - ' ) , B'(y ' -e')(/ 3 's ' ) ) C'=(z ' 3)(1'then we have A+B+C =0 , A'+ B'+ C ' 0 and thence BC'-B'C = CA'--CA =AB'-A'B ; and either of these expressions is in fact equal to the last-mentioned determinant , as may be easily verified .
Hence , when the determinant vanishes , we have A : B : C=A ' : B ' : C ' .
Any one of the three ratios A : B : C , for instance the ratio B : C= ( Ma ) ( a3 a is said to be the anharmonic ratio of the set ( ce , / 3 , , ) , and consequently the two sets ( ac , / 3 , y , I ) and ( a ' , 3 ' , y ' , b ' ) will be homographically related when the anharmonic ratios ( that is , the corresponding anharmonic ratios ) of the two sets are equal .
If any one of the anharmonic ratios be equal to unity , then the four terms of the set B taken in a proper manner in pairs , will be harmonics ; thus the equation =-1 gives ( y-At ) ( I3 -1 which is reducible to 2cos +2/ Sy(OG+ 8)( , B+ y)=0 , which expresses that the pairs a , 6 and / 3 y are harmonics .
109 .
Now returning to the theory of involution ( and for greater convenience taking a ' , &amp; &amp;c. instead of a , / 3 &amp;c. to represent the terms of the same pair ) , the pairs a , a ' ; 3 , / 3 ' ; y , y ' ; b , 3 ' &amp;c. will be in involution if each of the determinants formed with any three lines of the matrix 1 , i3+1 ' , [ 313 , 1 , w , A ' , &amp;c. vanishes : but this being so , the determinant.1 , cowl ~ cY 7 , CY 1 , ye ye rr ' 1 , 3 , Yl bb which is equal to ca , 1 , &amp; a+ a ' , CAh ' lie 1 , l b+b 33'Ill will vanish , or the two sets ( a , 1 , y , 5 ) and ( a ' , 1'I , , ' ) will be homographic ; that is , if any number of pairs are in involution , then , considering four pairs and selecting in any manner a term out of each pair , these four terms and the other terms of the same four pairs form respectively two sets , the two sets so obtained will be homographic .
110 .
In particular , if we have only three pairs ac , cet ; 3,1 3 ' ; tie , ' , then the sets oa , 13 , 7 , &amp; 9 and ce ' , I3 , y ' , a will be homographic ; in fact , the condition of homography is 1 a , ae , am/ -0O P1 019 PPt 1 , 3 , 713 , 1y 1 , is , y ' , y7oes which may be written o , 1 , O+Oa ' , OGai =0 , y , 1 , 7+7 ' , rr ' oex ' 1 , ex+ex , andx or what is the same thing , 1 , +a ' , d1 =0 , 13 , 1 , 1(3+13 ' , 1313 ' lie lyy , 7+7 ' , 77 x'-x , 0 , 0 , 0 , so that the first-mentioned relation is equivalent to ( M'-M ) 1 , rx+aOt , OI Os =0 , v7 +t matIry 1 , rumr'/ ry ' and the two sets give rise to an involution .
The condition of homography as expressed by the equality of the anharmonic ratios may be written at{ tal aI-P/ et f a. Cc-y mt t=c-e~c--3 or multiplying out , ( o3)(c -i')@ y)(o ' i r ) _(M.f3)(z ' -t)(M_ y)(z ' et ) 0 , which is a form for the equation of involution of the three pairs .
But this and the other transformations of the equation of involution is best obtained by a different method , as will be presently seen .
111 .
Imagine now any number of pairs as , a ' ) ; / 3 , / 3 ' r r ' ; P , ' , &amp;c. in involution , and let x , y , z , w be the fourth harmonics of the same quantity X with respect to the pairs as , e ' ; / 3 , / 3 ' ; ry , ' and 6 , 6 ' respectively ; then the anharmonic ratios of the set ( x , y , z , w ) will be independent of x , or what is the same thing , if x ' , y ' , z ' , w ' are the fourth harmonics of any other quantity a ' with respect to the same four pairs , the sets ( x , y , z , w ) and ( x ' , y ' , z ' , w ' ) will be homographic , or we shall have 1 , x , a ' , ax'I aI , XX =0 .
1 , yo yIp 1 , z , z ' , zdz ' 1 , w , wo ' , wwt ' It will be sufficient to show this in the case where X is anything whatever , but Xa has a determinate value , say Xa=oo ; and since if all the terms a , at ' , &amp;c. are diminished by the same quantity X the relations of involution and homography will not be affected , we may without loss of generality assume -=0 , but in this case and the equation to be proved is I1 -ant , ,a p+ , 0 v+y |1 r+ , tY~ y tt 1 , En +t , do which is obviously a consequence of the equations which express the involution of the four pairs .
FIFiTH MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS .
439 A set homographic with x , y , z , w , which are the fourth harmonics of any quantity whatever x. with respect to the pairs in involution , co , ce ' ; V3 , f3 ' ; y , y ' ; 8 , I ' , is said to be homographic with the four pairs , and we have thus the notion of a set of single quantities homographic with a set of pairs in involution .
This very important theory is due to M. CHASLES .
112 .
Let r ; s ; t , be the anharmonic ratios of a set are , f3 , y , 6 , and let r , ; s , ; t , be the anharmonic ratios ( corresponding or not corresponding ) of a set , j3 , , 7 , , 7 , .
And suppose that r ' ; s ' ; Is ; r , ; s ; t ; rt r ' ; s ; Is ' ; r ; 8 ; t r ; s " ; t ' , are the analogous quantities for three other pairs of sets ; then an equation such as Ir r , Lrrl =O .
S SI Ss , or as it is more conveniently written , ss , , rs , , r , s , rr , =0 / / / 1 / , / r'r s8 , , rs , , r , s rr , 88,8 , r~s , r~s , r I/ I / / / 1/ / 1/ / 1/ III I/ I 88 , , rs , , r , s , rr , is a relation independent of the particular ratios r : s which have been chosen for the anharmonic ratios of the sets ; this is easily shown by means of the equations r+s+t=0 , r , +s , +t , =O , which connect the anharmonic ratios .
The equation in fact expresses a certain relation between four sets ( z , P , V , 6 ) and four other sets ( ce , , 1 , , I , ) ; a relation which may be termed the relation of the homography of the anharmonic ratios of four and four sets : the notion of this relation is also due to M. CHASLES .
113 .
The general relation 1 , oc'+j3 , c'( = may be exhibited in a great variety of forms .
In fact , if the determinant is denoted by T , then multiplying by this determinant the two sides of the identical equation iU2 , -U , 1 =(u-v)(v-w)(w-U ) , w2 , -w , 1 ql 2 Ma~ we obtain ( in oc")(u-1A ' ) , ( v &amp; " )(v " ) , ( w-It")(W -13 ) If , for example , u= o , v=f3 , then we have T(cM -1)O(ce o')(oM-[')(1c")(1 -1")+(13 ')((3-')($e e")(cM-13 " ) And again , if m=o , v= &amp; o ' , 'w= ' , then we have Y= ( a 3)(c M3)(Ct " -13 ' ) + ( oG 13')(C ( 3")(CC -13 ) .
Or putting T 0 , the first equation gives ( a -al ) ( a/ ) ( -a ')( ' and the second equation gives ( 13 " ' f3)( " / 3 ' ) _(I 13')( &amp; / ' j !
/)(X1 _3 ) , which are both of them well-known forms .
114 .
A corresponding transformation applies to the equation 1 , o , ( Z M , =~ 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 ' , 131 ' 1 , yyS y 7 , b , rr/ which expresses the homography of two pairs .
In fact , calling the determinant T and representing by V the similar determinant s8 , -8 , 8 , 1 Utt , U , -U , 1VI VI1 V w',.-v , -v6 , 1 which , equated to zero , would express the homography of the sets ( s , t , u , v ) and ( 8 ' , t ' , U ' , v ' ) , we have ( tn ct)(U ci ) , ( tj)(t ' -( ' ) , ( t y)(u ' -y1 ) , ( tn )(u ' -3t ( V-OC(Vt06 ) , ( UP )(V'-P ' ) , ( V7)(V , - , Y9 , ( V ; )(V'-Yt ) .
which gives various forms of the equation of homography .
In particular , if s -= , s'= ' , t_ , t'= oc ' , -u=y , Wn ' ' , v= , v'1= , then -a')O * *)(3 ' -y ' ) , ( -b)(13'I ' ) ( t )(7 , x ) ( -0( ' ) and the right-hand side breaks up into factors , which are equal to each other ( whence also V=T ) , and the equation TP 0 takes the form -M Y)(~)(cM ' a')( ' r ' ) -(ce t)G(y)( &amp; r')(j ' ' ) -0 which is , in fact , one of the equations which express the equality of the anharmonic ratios of ( oI , 3 , r , b ) and ( ox ' , P ' , y ' , b ' ) .
115 .
In the case of a cubic , the expressions considered are(a , b , c , dax , YY3 ( 1 ) ( a-I 2 , ad-bc , bd-c2Ox , &amp; )2 , ( 2 ) F-a2d + 3abe2b3 , 3 -abd+2ac2 b2c , +acd-2b2d+bc , 2X ( 3 ) +ad2 -3bcd+2c3 9a d2 -6abcd+4ac3 +4b3d3b2c3 , ( 4 ) where ( 1 ) is the cubic , ( 2 ) is the quadricovariant or Hessian , ( 3 ) is the cubicovariant , and ( 4 ) is the quartinvariant or discriminant .
And where it is convenient to do so , I write ( 1)= U ( 2 ) = H , ( 3 ) =D , ( 4 ) = 0 , so that we have 4)2 oU2+4H3= .
116 .
The Hessian may be written under the form ( ax+ by)(cx + die ) ( bx+cy)2 , ( which , indeed , is the form under which qua Hessian it is originally given ) , and under the form Y,2 , YX X2 a , b , c b , c , d The cubicovariant may be written under the form { 2(ac -b2)X+ ( ad-be)y}(bX2 + 2exy +dy2 ) -{(ad-bc)x +2(bd c2)y } ( aX2+2bxy1+cy2 ) , that is , as the Jacobian of the cubic and Hessian ; and under the form 60 ( a lb _X X )3 )3 that is , as the evectant of the discriminant .
The discriminant , taken negatively , may be written under the form +4(ac -b2)(bd c2 ) -(ad-bc)2 , that is , as the discriminant of the Hessian .
We have ( a , b , c , dXbx2+2exy+dy2 , -a2-2bxy-cy2)3=UD , which expresses that a transmutant of the cubic is the product of the cubic and the cubicovariant .
The equation { p Ea b _X)3}2 0 ?
=2U2 expresses that the second evectant of the discriminant is the square of the cubic .
The equation d2 , -3cd , 3bd+ 6c2 , -3bc+2ad =27 02 -30d , _32+ 12bd , -3ad-6be , X3ac+6b2 -3bd+6c2 , -3ad-6bc , -3b2+12ac , -3ab -3bc12ad , -3ac+6b2 , 3cab , a2 expresses that the determinant formed with the second differential coefficients of the discriminant gives the square of the discriminant .
The covariants of the intermediate olU+Pr3I are as follows , viz.118 .
For the Hessian , we have H(alU+P3I)=(1 , 0 , a ( 3)21H ( Q62 _(2 0)H ; for the cubicovariant , )(D6U+fA))=(0 , 0 , 0 , -02 2A 3)3U +(1 , 0 , 0 , 1P)3 ) -(a,52_2 0 )(aD+p0 DU ) ; and for the discriminant , o(aU+3)F)=(1 , 0 , -20 , 0 , 02X i)4@ ( a2_p2 0o)20 , where on the left-hand sides I have , for greater distinctness , written H , &amp;c. to denote the functional operation of taking the Hessian , &amp;c. of the operand clU+13cP .
In particular , if s=0 , O.=1 , Ho= o0 .
119 .
Solution of a cubic equation .
The question is to find a linear factor of the cubic ( a ' , b , el denX Y)3 , and this can be at once effected by means of the relation D2 0U2=-4H3 between the covariants .
The equation in fact shows that each of the expressions '(CD+UVO ) , 2(@-UVO ) is a perfect cube , and consequently that the cube root of each of these expressions is a linear function of ( x , y ) .
The expression 2((D+ UV ) 2((DV-u0z is consequently a linear function of x , y , and it vanishes when U= 0 , that is , the expression is a linear factor of the cubic .
It may be noticed here that the cubic being a(x-ay)(x -3Py)(x-yy ) , then we may write_ ___ 3~~~~ 3( VI 4+ UV a)2uV)a 3(c c2)( coy ) where c is an imaginary cube root of unity : this will appear from the expressions which will be presently given for the covariants in terms of the roots .
120 .
Canonical form of the cubic .
The expressions -Q(( + UV !
0 ) , Q(DUV'O ) are perfect cubes ; and if we write ( )+UV , / )=V x3 -(( ?
UV / )= / y3 , then we have UI x3+y3 , ( D=V/ o } ( X3 y3 ) and thence also H1 -/ Oxy .
121 .
When the cubic is expressed in terms of the roots , we have aU ( X y)(x PA( - , Yy ) ; and then putting for shortness A= ( f3-r)Qr -a B= ( r-)(x-.-- ?
) , so that A+B+C=0 , we have r-2H =I ( A2+B2+C2)(BC+CA+AB ) , a:-3(D = -2 I(B -C)(C -A)(A B a4 0 _( y )'( fie Mt)2(V_ P)2 122 .
The covariants H , oD are most simply expressed as above , but it may be proper to add the equations a-2H= -I J( 2(P222_2y)2 62 + P2 + , Z _ pr _ f7 =-18 6@yPry2 _ yV2 &lt; 2 02ty_ y2 _20 t y)2 &amp; 272 +2 2+ 232 -c2fP2rcy_ r2V j9 0{(+3 +'2r ?

It may be observed that we have a-6 SU2=_-__A2B2C2 , which , with the above values of H , 4P in terms of A , B , C and the equation A+B+C=0 , verifies the equation q)2_C 3U2+4H3=O , which connects the covariants .
In fact , we have identically , ( BC)2(CA)2(A -B)2= -4(A+B+C)3ABC+(A+B+C)2(BC+CA+AB)2+ 18(A+B+C)(BC+CA+AB)ABC -4(BC+CA+AB)3 -27A2B2C2 by means of which the verification can be at once effected .
124 .
If , as before , c is an imaginary cube root of unity , then we may write 27a-3 = -(B-C)(C-A)(A-B ) 27a-3UVs 0= 3(c4W2)ABC , and these values give 27a -32I ( +UV a)U { ( c(+ v2/ 3+ W7 ) X+(Pyr+ W2rc%+ )y}3 27a-3I ( )-DUV.3 ) = ( a+6 , .

The preceding formulae show without difficulty , that each factor of the cubic covariant is the harmonic of a factor of the cubic with respect to the other two factors of the cubic ; and moreover , that the factors of the cubic and the cubicovariant form together an involution having for sibiconjugates the factors of the Hessian .
In fact , the harmonic of x-o y with respect to ( x-Py)(x-yy ) is ( 2-P-ry)x+(2Py-ryoa-oP)y , which is a factor of the cubicovariant ; the product of the pair of harmonic factors is and multiplying this by 3 -y , and taking the sum of the analogous expressions , this sum vanishes , or the three pairs form an involution .
That the Hessian gives the sibiconjugates of the involution is most readily shown as follows : the last-mentioned quadric may be written -(_a+f3+r)+ 3a )x2+2 ( xq3+cr+f(ry-ox(os+f3+r))xy+ ( -3apiyr+ a(oq +o Mr+p7))Y 2 which is equal to ( 3a +3a)x2 +2 ( 3a-3 a x)y+ ( 3 +3)a Y2 or , throwing out the factor 3a-1 , to ( b+at , 2c-2bt % , d+cc(x , y)2 , which is harmonically related to the Hessian ( ac-b2 , ad-be , bd-c(Tx , y)2 ; and in like manner the other two pairs of factors will be also harmonically related to the Hessian .
126 .
In the case of a pair of equal roots , we have a-'U ( x-zy)2(Xryy ) ; a-21H= _ y)2Q(X-_y)2 , a-3(D)2 ( &amp; _Iy)3(Xcy)3 E =0 .
And in the case of all the roots equal , we have au = ( X_ MYV aU =(-oy)3 , H-O P=O .

In the solution of a biquadratic equation we have to consider the cubic equation z~3-M(z--1)=O .
The cubic here is ( 1 , 0 , -M , Mjw , 1 ) ' , or what is the same thing , ( 1 , O.-1M , MidW , 1)3 ; the Hessian is M(_ 9 19 _OMEN 1)2 ; the cubicovariant is M -lgM 3 M+ _M23(Wl 1)3 ; and the discriminant is M2(1 _ AM ) .

In the case of a quartic , the expressions considered are(az , b , el d , eat , y ) ' , ( l ) ae4bd+ 3c2 , ( 2 ) ( ac-b2 , 2(ad-be ) , ae+2bd-3c2 , 2(be-cd ) , ce-d2 21 , y)4 , ( 3 ) ace+2bedad2 b2eC3 , ( 4 ) r a2d + 3abc 2b , a2e2abd+j 9aC2-6b2c , 5abe +15acsd-10b 'd , j +lOad2 -106e , x , )6 , ( 5 ) + 5ade+10bd2 -15bce , + .

And where it is convenient to do so , I write ( 1 ) = U , ( 2 ) I ( 3 ) _ H , ( 4 ) J ( 5 ) 0 .
The preceding covariants are connected by the equation JU3 IU2H+4H3= -D2 The discriminant is not an irreducible invariant , its value is E= 13-27J2=a3e3+ &amp;c. , for which see Table No. 12 .
129 .
It is for some purposes convenient to arrange the expanded expression of the discriminant in powers of the middle coefficient c. We thus have o= a3e3 _12a2bde227a2d4 6ab2d2e27b4e2 64b3d3 + c(54a2d2e + 54ab2e2+ 108abd3+ 108b3de ) -C2( 18a2e2 180abde+ 36b2d2 ) +C3(54ad2 _ 54b2e ) + 4(81ae ) .

Solution of a biquadratic equation .
We have to find a linear factor of the quartic ( a , b , c , d , etx , y)4 .
The equation JU3-IU2H+4H3= _ 1I)2 , putting for shortness 13 may be written Hence , if we ) w2l 3 are the roots of ( 1 , 0,._M , MjZMi 1)3= 0 , the expressions IH-aJU III-.-2JU IH-,3JU are each of them squares ; write ( W2-W , )(IH wjU)=X ' , ( w , -w , )(IH-w2JU ) = Y ' , ( UlW2)(IHIwJU ) = Z2 so that , identically , and consequently X+ Y , XY are each of them squares .
The expression ax+ pie +rz will be a square if only C2 ?
I2+r2 =0 , which may be seen by writing it under the form ( a + 13)(XY ) + - !
( -3)(X + 1Y ) YiVX2+Y2 ; and in particular , writing V'02-W3 , VW 3 &gt; Vz , / 2 for a , A , Ay , the expression ( V2Z3)V1111-Wl'JU+ ( W3 'M)VIlzS2JU+ ( WlzW2)VIHSJU is a square ; and since the product of the different values is a multiple of U2 ( this is most readily perceived by observing that the expression vanishes for U= 0 ) , the expression is the square of a linear factor of the quartic .
131 .
To complete the solution : f wS , 3 are the roots of the cubic equation ( 1,0,.-3M , M)CO , 1)3_0 ; and hence , putting for shortness , 3=_{( Ad1 Mv IMI M+ 2 23tI tJU 3+V / l-M_ l,4 , -M , M3rIH , JU)3l Q3=2M(-1 , 9M , 3M+-27-M2 , 1H JU)3 _Vj__4 , M I,3M M3IHjTU)3l we have ( x being an imaginary cube root of unity ) And 'if 1( 2)(2 z3)(IH 1JU ) =P Q. PQ 13= -1l+V1-_4M } , then 3(i 2)(a2W &gt; ) PQ0 .
Hence , multiplying and observing that ( cW2)2= _3 , we find ( Co W2)2(W2z3 ) ( I-wlJU)= ( P-Q)(P0-Q0 ) , and consequently ( ~'02 -3)VIH _oJU =(a-}2)V , ( P _ Q)(P0 Qo ) .
We have , in like manner , ( W _ 2)(s -w , )(IH-w]jU)= P-Q , -( a}2 ) ( w Wj(III WJU ) =WP WQ , I(* _O2)(Ul 2)(IH-z2JU)=X P and _ )(-2 _'3 ) P0 Q. , 3(* a2 ) ( 'X3 -a O)J Po -Q , 3(W _ W2 ) ( VZ _ 2 ) W2Po-_ , Qo , and therefore ( V2 3)VIH-zxlJ7U=(w k 2)4 1 ) ( oQ ) ( -3 z ) VJH -Hr2JU ( o_ 0j 2 ) Q)( O Q ) ( Z3 -1)VIH v3JU =( 2)V ( W 2P Q)(W2PcQ0 ) ; and hence disregarding the common factor W -_ 2 , the square of the linear factor of the quartic is V7 -(PQ)(PoQo)+V ( WP -2Q)(0P0 W2QO ) +V ( W2P _ WQ)(W2P0 WQO ) , which is the required solution .
It may be proper to add that -71Po+ Q0 , =oj P + .
92QO ) _ V53 = o2po +O Q0 .
132 .
The solution gives at once the canonical form of the quartic ; in fact , writing X~sY=2s/ ( 2S3)(W3--ffj/ -TX XY=2v(w - ) _I)V y where X , Y have their former significations , we find , by a simple reduction , IH-ziT1XIJ= ( zg3-..zj)J(X2+y2)2 TH -a JU= IH - , a JU= ( VT2 --3 ) J(X2 J y2)2 IH-w3 ; U=_(W '-S ) *3 -W1 ) ; X2y2 , and thence putting W2 ( W W ) ( w)2po + wQo ) ( 2po wQ0 ) 7 we have U=X4+y4+ 6x2y2 which is the form required .
133 .
The Hessian may be written under the form that iah acs , aabs ta t. that is , as the evectant of the cubinvariant .
The cubicovariant may be obtained by writing the quartic under the form ( ax+by , bx+cy , cx+ die , dx+eyzx , y ) ' and treating the linear functions as coefficients , or considering this as a cubic , the cubicovariant of the cubic gives the cubicovariant of the quartic .
If we represent the cubicovariant by cD = ( a , b , c ) d , e , f , gyp , ' Y)6 then we have identically , ag-9ce+8d2=0 ; and moreover forming the quadrinvariant of the sextic , we find ag-6bf+15ce-1Od2= JO , where 0 is the discriminant of the quartic .
From these two equations we find bf4ce+3d2= __-_ ?
which is an expression given by Mr. SALMON : it is the more remarkable as the lefthand side is the quadrinvariant of ( b , c , d , e , fly , y)4 , which is not a covariant of the quartic .
It may be noticed also that we have af3be+2cd0 bg3cf+2de=O .
134 .
The covariants of the intermediate aU+ 631H of the quartic and Hessian are as follows , viz. The quadrinvariant is I(oaU+ 60H)=(I , 1 8J , 32o , } ) the cubinvariant is J(aU+ 61H ) ( J. I2 , 91J , --I3+54J2S &gt; s , 33 ; the Hessian is H(ozU+6 1H)=(1 , 0 , P3Itc , )2H +(0 , I , 9JXj , P)2U ; and the cubicovariant is F(DzU+6PH)=(1 , 0 , -91 , -54Joc , 03 ) ; to which may be added the discriminant , which is O(dU+6PH)=(1 , 0 , _181 , 108J , 8112 , 9721J , -2916J21oa , f3)6E .

Moreover , we have JW .
for substituting this value in the equation A=O , we obtain the before-mentioned equation ff3-M( j 1 ) = O. We have , therefore , e 'bd7 'bc : -bb , 'baTXX Y)4At= IW Ur-Hf=(IH'JwU ' ) , and the equation becomes ( a , b , c , d , e4X , Yaw , y)JA1U ' ?
Jw_ Moreover , if ( x o-y ) be a factor of the quartic , then replacing in the formula y by the value oax , ( x , y ) will disappear altogether ; and then changing ( X , Y ) into ( x , y ) where x , y are now arbitrary , we have 3 ( a , b , c , d , e)lf~ , ylaj 1 ) Ill.zu I jU H-w JU _ , ,y N/ N-/ H rJU += 3 s/ H7 3U which is a form connected with the results in Nos. 130 and 131 .

We have y4 , 4xy3 , 6X2y2 , 4x3y , X4 =61H-9JU ; a , 3b , 3c , d a , 3b , 3c , d b , 3e , 3d , e b , 3c , 3d , e it will appear from the formulae relating to the roots of the quartic , that the expression -61H 9JU vanishes identically when there are two pairs of equal roots , or what is the same thing , when the quartic is a perfect square .
The conditions in order that the expression may vanish are obviously 6(ac-b2 ) : 3(ad-6be ) : ae+2bd-3c2 : 3(be-cd ) : 6(ce-d2 ) : 9J a : 6 c : d e : I , conditions which imply that the several determinants 6(ac-b2 ) , 3ad-be , ae+2bd-3c2 , 3(be-cd ) , 6(ce d2 ) a , b , c , d , e all of them vanish .
If for a moment we write 6H1= ( a ' , 6 ' , c ' , d ' , e'Wx , y ) ' , then the determinants are at c ' , d ' , e a , b , c , d , e we have identically ad ' -a'd= 3(bc'-b'c ) , eb ' e'b =3(dc'd'c ) , ae'ate =3(bd'-b 'd ) , and the ten determinants thus reduce themselves to seven determinants only , these in fact being , to mere numerical factors pres , the coefficients of the cubicovariant ; this perfectly agrees with a subsequent result , viz. that the cubicovariant vanishes identically when the quartic is a perfect square .
137 .
It may be remarked that the equation 6IH-9JU=O will be satisfied identically if c-= ce= fbd-(c-p)(+2'p ) where p is arbitrary ; the quartic is in this case the square of ( / c-P / c- , 7 Y)2 If with the conditions in question we combine the equation I= 0 ( which in this case implies also J=0 ) , we obtain P=O , and consequently abcd or the quartic will be a complete fourth power .
It is easy to express in terms of the coefficients a ' , 6 ' , c ' , d ' , e ' of 6H the different determinants a , b , c , d ' , b , c , d , e we have in fact ae =bd =(c'+46 'd ' 3c2 ) , ac-b2 =*a ' , ad-bc _ eb ' , be-cd ' a V , be-ed2 le ' whence all the above-mentioned determinants will vanish , or the quartic will be a perfect fourth power if only the Hessian vanishes identically .
138 .
Considering the quartic as expressed in terms of the roots , we have and if we write for shortness B =(ro)GX3-4 ) , C =Qx-f3)(Y-a ) , which are connected by A+B+C=O , then we have a-2I-=_I(A2+B2+C2)= --I ( BC+CA+AB ) , a-3J=__3B -C)(C-A)(A-B ) ; and for the discriminant we have a-6 06 ry)2a _ -)2(p _6)2(r ' t)2 -2 5 6-2$ , and it is easy by means of a preceding formula to verify the equation 0 =13--27J2 .

We have M=%7 ( B-C)2(C-A)2(A-B)2 or putting for shortness A A2 +B2+C2 2 ( B-C)(C-A)(A-B ) ' we have M=3(A 2+ B2+C:2)A2 ; and it is then easy to deduce zV1 =A(B C ) ZV2= A(C -A ) W3_ =A(A-B ) .
; in fact , these values give 1 +4 '2 + M3 ?
Wr 2+M1U73+U2M3= M f1f273 Ml , and they are consequently the roots of the equation a3-M(Z'1)=0 .

The leading coefficient of IH--zvJU is then equal to a4 into the following expression , viz. W(A2+B2+C2)2(eb2 ) 2I 8(A2+B2+ C2)(BC ) , which is equal to 1 115 -(A2+B2 C2 ) { 48cr2(ac6b2)-4(B C ) } and the term in { } is which is equal to 3(b+ez-3--r)2 .

The equation I=O gives A : B : C=1 : w : g1 where w is an imaginary cube root of unity ; the factors of the quartic may be said in this case to be Symmetric Harmonies .
The equation J=O gives one of the three equations , A=B , B=C , C=A ; in this case a pair of factors of the quartic are harmonics with respect to the other pair of factors .
If we have simultaneously 1=- , J=- , then A=B=C=O and in this case three of the factors of the quartic are equal .
144 .
If any two of the linear factors of the quartic are considered as forming , with the other two linear factors , an involution , the sibiconjugates of the involution make up a quadratic factor of the cubicovariant ; and considering the three pairs of sibiconjugates , or what is the same thing , the six linear factors of the cubicovariant , the factors of a pair are the sibiconjugates of the involution formed by the other two pairs of factors .
In fact , the sibiconjugates of the involution formed by the equations ( X my ) ( X )0 , ( X Y ) ( X 0yare found by means of the Jacobian of these two functions , viz. of the quadrics ( 2 , 6-a 2l ( ay)2 ( 2 , -f-7 , 2Iy:rx , y)2 , which is ( b+ 'A 7 ) -t+ 7 8M _P7)-(6+a)$:( y)2 ) viz. a quadratic factor of the cubicovariant ; and forming the other two factors , there is no difficulty in seeing that any one of these is the Jacobian of the other two , 145 .

In the case of two pairs of equal roots , we have a-lU= ( X acy)2(X_ 7y)2 , '= 0 ; these values give also 6IH9JU=0 .
