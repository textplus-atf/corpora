IV.--On a method of comparing the light of the sun with that of the ixed stars .
By WILLIAM HYDE WOLLASTON , M.D. F.R.S. Read December 11 , 1828 .
ONE of the most ingenious contributors to the Transactions of our Society in the last century , the Rev. JOHN MICHELL , in a paper entitled " An inquiry into the probable parallax and magnitude of fixed stars , &amp; c* .
" has proposed it to astronomers , as an object worthy their attention , to determine what proportion the light , afforded us separately by each fixed star , bears to the light which we receive from the sun ; since , from our inability to measure the annual parallax of those very remote bodies , such a comparison is the best , perhaps the only method within our reach , of obtaining , though not certain , yet probable estimates of their distances ; and thus forming reasonable conjectures concerning the extent of the visible universe .
In order that we may judge , with the least chance of error , of the mean distance of those stars which are the nearest to the earth , he directs us to compare the light of the brightest stars with that of the sun , and next to calculate how far the sun must be removed , to make the light that we should then receive from him , not more than equal to the mean light of the stars chosen for comparison .
Mr. MICHELL made , as he says , some rude experiments for determining the comparative brilliancy of certain principal stars ; but has not suggested any contrivance for comparing a star with the sun .
He states , however , so distinctly the great object of such a comparison , and the inferences which an industrious observer would thence be entitled to draw , concerning the distances of those stars whose light he might succeed in measuring , that it is surprising that no astronomer has been incited by these remarks to devise a method of making the requisite observations , and that now , so many years after Mr. MICHELL'S suggestion was made public , so much remains to be effected in this branch of photometry .
From a comparison which I made in the year 1799 ( by a method described in the note subjoined ) of the light of the sun with that of the moon , I should estimate the direct light of the sun as being nearly one million times greater than that of the moon* ; and consequently the direct light of the sun as very many millions times greater than that afforded us by all the fixed stars , taken collectively .
Such then being , to our visual organs , the vast disproportion in radiance between the sun and the whole starry firmament , it is not to be expected that we should assign very accurately how much greater the light of the sun is , than that exceedingly minute quantity of it which shines upon us from any one , even the most brilliant of the fixed stars .
It may be remembered that on a former occasion , in examining the correct performance of a good telescope , I found that the sun 's image , reflected from the surface of a small sphere , ( such as that of a thermometer-bulb filled with mercury , ) and viewed at a proper distance through a telescope , is , to appearance , extremely like a fixed star , and forms , in such experiments , an admirable substitute for one , in being really fixed , and therefore well adapted for deliberate observation .
It occurred to me , while engaged in this examination , that by comparing such a reflected image with one of the larger stars , I might be able to obtain some grounds for estimating the light of the star .
It would be desireable , though extremely difficult , in conducting such an experiment , to make a direct comparison betweenll the star and the sun 's image ; since in that case we should be enabled to avoid the uncertainties inseparable from an indirect comparison , the consequence of observing at times so distant , that the atmosphere in the interval has undergone considerable change .
As , however , the only practicable method of observing is the indirect one , by comparing the two objects with some common standard at different times , we must endeavour to remove those uncertainties from our results , by repeating each series of comparisons so frequently , that the average of each series may be affected by atmospheric vicissitudes , or may fairly be presumed to be so , in an equal degree .
The common standard of comparison which I chose , was the image of a candle , reflected from a small thermometer-bulb , ( in most trials about lth of an inch in diameter , ) filled with mercury , and seen by one eye through a lens of about two inches focus , at the same time that the sun 's image , reflected ( in the manner above described ) from a thermometer-bulb placed at a distance , or the star itself , was viewed by the other eye through a telescope .
In order to make the light of the two objects , when seen through the telescope , and that of the candle , more nearly alike in colour , I placed two yellow glasses at the eye-piece ; and I thought it expedient to have in view , at the same time with the subject of comparison , two candles , one of tallow , the other of wax ; that by making the star , or the little sun , a mean between the two lights , I might obtain a nearer approximation to the truth* .
The measure taken in each experiment was the distance of the two candles from the bulb ; and every distance that I have reported amongst the observations , was the mean result of several trials .
In reducing these observations we have to consider that though the image of the sun , which is half the radius distant from the centre of the bulb , subtends at its surface the same angle , of half a degree , as the sun itself , and therefore to an eye placed at the surface would appear equally brilliant with the sun itself ; yet the apparent diameter of this little sun will decrease in proportion as the eye recedes from the bulb , so that at the distance of D inches , the apparent diameter of the image will be reduced in the ratio of 4th of the diameter of the bulb , or of _- , to D , and consequently the brightness of the 4D 4D image will be reduced in the ratio of 1 to the square of B. If the distance of the eye from the bulb be so chosen , that , on comparing the little sun and the star , separately , with the candle 's image , the candle in the two cases is at unequal distances from its bulb , d being made to represent the candle 's distance from the bulb in comparing it with the sun , and 3 the candle 's 4Da distance from the bulb in comparing it with the star , -gX will be the distance at which the little sun would appear of equal brightness with the star , and the brightness of the little sun would then be to the brightness of the sun itself as 1 to [ L4 xdl If , in two comparisons made , the one between the candle and the sun , the other between the candle and a star , the candle be reflected by bulbs of different diameters , and viewed with lenses of unequal focal length , the apparent diameter of the candle 's image will be as the diameter of the bulb directly , and as the focal length of the lens inversely ; and hence , if b be the diameter of the bulb and I the focal length of the lens in comparing the candle with the sun , and 3 be the diameter of the bulb and X the focal length of the lens in com* If any other artificial light could be found , which would at all times be of uniform brilliancy , and of so white a colour as to supersede the necessity of using yellow glasses , it would of course be preferable , as a standard , to the light of a candle .
paring the candle with the star , BX XX will be the distance at which the little sun would appear of equal brightness with the star ; and the brightness of the little sun would then be to the brightness of the sun itself as 1 to Bxaxl x ; and it is according to the latter formula that the observations , made with bulbs of different diameter and with lenses of different focal length , have been reduced so as to be compared in No IV .
of the Appendix .
The first star that I compared with the sun , was Sirius ; and the observations were made at times when , the altitudes of the two bodies being not very widely different , their powers of illumination might be presumed to be affected , on the average , in almost an equal degree by the atmosphere .
The table of reduced observations [ No. IV .
of the Appendix ] , in which each of seven observations of the sun is compared with each of seven observations of Sirius , will be found to exhibit discordances , which are referrible , probably , to our variable climate , and to the smoky atmosphere of London .
Uniformly transparent skies are requisite to give uniformity to such experiments ; and in our climate , therefore , though the mean of very many comparisons would , probably , give a result not very remote from the mean of a much smaller number of trials made under a less variable atmosphere , we must expect the greatest and least results to differ widely from one another* .
The mean of the various trials seems to show , that the light of Sirius is equal to that of the sun reflected from the surface of a sphere -oth of an inch in diameter , and seen at the distance of about 210 feet .
The diameter of such an image of the sun , is to that of the sun itself as 1 to 100,000 ; and , consequently , the brightness of the image would be to the brightness of the sun itself as 1 to 10,000,000,000 ; but as nearly half of the light must be lost during reflection , we are not warranted by these experiments in supposing that the light of Sirius exceeds a 20,000,000,000th part of the sun 's light .
Were the sun removed to such a distance , that the light which we received from it were only a twenty thousand millionth part of its present light , that distance would be equal to ^/ 2 X 100,000 X its present distance , and it would , if still situated in the ecliptic , have a parallax in longitude of nearly 3 " ; but if placed at the same angular distance from the ecliptic , as Sirius , since the parallax varies as the sine of a star 's latitude , and the latitude of Sirius is about 39 ? ? ? ?
, it would have a parallax in latitude of about 1"6 .
Assuming the parallax of Sirius to be half a second , and consequently its distance from the earth to be 525,481 times the distance of the sun from the earth , Sirius , if placed at the sun 's distance , would subtend 3.7 times the sun 's apparent diameter , and would afford us as much light as 13.8 suns .
From similar experiments to those I made on Sirius , it appeared that the light afforded us by Lyra was about 10 oooooooth part of the sun 's light , or about gth part of the light of Sirius .
Without extending this method to a comparison of the stars with the sun , we may confine it , if we think proper , to comparing the stars with one another , so that , in fulfilment of the wishes of Mr. MICHELL* , " instead of distributing them , as has hitherto been done , into a few ill-defined classes , they may be ranked with precision , both according to their respective brightness , and the exact degree of it .
" In concluding the paper which is now submitted to the Society , I request them to direct their attention rather to the method than to the observations ; for these have been much too few in number to enable me to state with any degree of confidence , what proportion the light of the sun really does bear to either of the stars compared with it .
It was my intention , had my health permitted it , to have proceeded with this inquiry , until by multiplied observations I had ascertained how nearly the mean of one extensive series of comparisons accorded with the mean of another series ; and how far , therefore , the method itself was deserving of confidence .
But since I have now no prospect of bringing the subject to perfection , I submit the method itself to the consideration of industrious observers , who will soon be able to judge of the expediency of continuing the inquiry .
