An Instance of the Excellence of the Modern ALGEBR A , in the Resolution of the Problem of finding the Foci of Optic Glasses universally .
By E. Halley , S. R. S. .
THE Excellence of the Modern Geometry is in nothing more evident , than in those full and adequate Solutions it gives to Problems ; representing all the possible Cases at one view , and in one general Theorem many times comprehending whole Sciences ; which deduced at length into Propositions , and demonstrated after the manner of the Ancients , might well become the Subjects of large Treatises : For whatsoever Theorem solves the most complicated Problem of the kind , does with a due Reduction reach all the subordinate Cases .
Of this I now design to give a notable Instance in the Doctrine of Dioptricks .
This Dioptrick Problem is that of finding the Focus of any sort of Lens , exposed either to Converging , Diverging or parallel Rays of Light , proceeding from , or tending to a given Point in the Axis of the Lens , be the ratio of Refraction what it will , according to the nature of the Transparent Material whereof the Lens is formed , and also with allowance for the thickness of the Lens between the Vertices of the two Spherical Segments .
This Problem being solved in one Case , mutatis mutandis will exhibit Theorems for all the possable Cases , whether the Lens be Double-Convex or Double-Concave , Plano-Convex or Plano-Concave , or Convexo-Concave , which sort are usually called Menisci .
But this is only to be understood of those Beams which are nearest to the Axis of the Lens , so as to occasion no sensible difference by their Inclination thereto ; and the Focus here formed is by Dioptrick Writers commonly called the principal Focus , being that of use in Telescopes and Microscopes .
Let then ( in Fig. 18 .
) BE~ be a double Convex Lens , C the Center of the Segment EB , and K the Center of the Segment E~ , B~ the thickness of the Lens , Da point in the Axis of the Lens ; and it is required to find the point F , at which the Beams proceeding from the point D , are collected therein , the ratio of Refraction being as m to n. Let the distance of the object DB = DA=d ( the point A being supposed the same with B , but taken at a distance therefrom , to prevent the coincidence of so many Lines ) the Radius of the Segment towards the Object CB or CA=r , and the Radius of the Segment from the Object K~ or K~=~ , and let B~ the thickness of the Lens be = t , and then let the Sine of the Angle of incidence DAG be to the sine of the refracted Angle HAG or CA~ as m to n ; And in very small Angles the Angles themselves will be in the same proportion ; whence it will follow that , As d to r , so the Angle at C to the Angle at D , and d+r will be as the Angle of incidence GAD ; and again as m to n , so d~r to d n+r n , / m which will be as the Angle GAH = CA~ .
This being taken from ACD which is as d , will leave m-n d-n r/ m analogous to the Angle A~D , and the sides being in this case proportional to the Angles they subtend , it will follow , that as the Angle A~D is to the Angle AD ~ , so is the side AD or BD to A~ or B ~ : that is B~ will be =m d r/ m-n d-n r which shows in what point the beams proceeding from D would be collected by means of the first Refraction ; but if nr cannot be substracted from m-n d , it follows that the Beams after Refraction do still pass on diverging , and the point ~ is on the same side of the Lens beyond D. But if nr be equal to m-n d then they proceed parallel to the Axis , and the point ~ is infinitely distant .
The point ~ being found as before , and B ~-B~ being given , which we will call ~ , it follows by a process like the former , that ~F or the focal distance sought , is equal to ~p n/ m-n ~+m p=f .
And in the room of ~ substituting B~-B~ =md r/ m-n d-n r t , putting p for n/ m n after due reduction this following Equation will arise , mpdrpndpt+nprp t/ m dr+md~mpr~mndt+nrt= f. Which Theorem , however it may seem operose , is not so , considering the great number of data that enter the Question , and that one half of the terms arise from our taking in the thickness of the Lens , which in most cases can produce no great effect , however it was necessary to consider it , to make our Rule perfect .
If therefore the Lens consist of Glass , whose Refraction is as 3 to 2 'twill be 6dr p-2 dp t+4 rp t/ 3 d r+3 d p-6 r p-d t+2 rt= f. If of Water , whose Refraction is as 4 to 3 the Theorem will stand thus 12 dr p-3 dp t+9 rp t./ 4 dr+4d p12 r p-d t~3rt= f. If it could be made of Diamant , whose Refraction is as 5 to 2 , it would be ~dr p-2 dpt~rp t/ 5 dr~5dp -~ r p-3 dt~2rt= f. And this is the universal Rule for the foci of double Convex Glasses exposed to Diverging Rays .
But if the thickness of the Leus be rejected as not sensible , the Rule will be much shorter , viz. pdr p/ d r~d p-p rp =f , or in Glass 2dr p/ d r~d p-2 rp= f. all the terms wherein t is found being omitted , as equal to nothing .
In this case , if d be so small , as that 2rp exceed dr~d p , then will it be f , or the focus will be Negative , which shows that the Beams after both Refractions still proceed Diverging .
To bring this to the other Cases , as of Converging Beams , or of Concave Glasses , the Rule is ever composed of the same terms , only changing the signs of ~ and - ; for the distance of the point of Concourse of converging Beams , from the point B , or the first surface of the Lens , I call a negative distance or-d ; and the Radius of a Concave Lens I call a negative Radius or-r if it be the first surface , and -p , if it be the second surface .
Let then converging Beams fall on a double Convex vex of Glass , and the Theorem will stand thus 2dr p/ -d r-d p-2 rp =+ f. which shows that in this case the Focus is always affirmative .
If the Lens were a Meniscus of Glass , exposed to diverging Beams , the Rule is -2 dr p/ -d r+d p~2r p=f .
which is affirmative when 2rp is less than d r~d p , otherwise negative : But in the case of converging Beams falling on the same fame Meniscus , 'twill be ~2dr p/ ~ drdp~2r p=f .
and it will be ~f whilst d p-d r is less than 2r p. but if it be greater than 2r p , it will always be found negative or f. If the Lens be double Concave , the focus of converging Beams is negative , where it was affirmative in the case of diverging Beams on a double Convex , viz. -2 dr p/ ~ dr~d p-2 r p=f , which is affirmative only when 2rp exceeds d r~d p : But diverging Beams passing a double Concave have always a negative focus , viz. -2 dr p/ ~ d r~d p~2 rp= f. The Theorems for Converging Beams are principally of use to determine the focus resulting from any sort of Lens placed in a Telescope , between the focus of the Object-glass and the Glass it self ; the distance between the said focus of the Object0glass and the interposed Lens being made=-d .
I here suppose my Reader acquainted with the Rules of Analytical Multiplication and Division , as that ~ multiplied by ~ makes the product ~ , ~ by makes - , and by makes ~ , so dividing ~ by ~ makes the Quote ~ , + by makes - , and by makes ~ , which will be necessary to be understood in the preceding Examples .
In case the Beams are parallel , as coming from an insinite distance , ( which is supposed in the case of Telescopes ) then will d be supposed infinite , and in the Theorem pdp r/ d r~dpprp the Term prp vanishes , as being finite , which is no part of theother infinite terms and dividing the remainder by the infinite part d , the Theorem will stand thus pp r/ r ~p= f , or in G'ass , 2r p/ r ~~= f. In case the Lens were Plano Convex exposed to diverging Beams , instead of pdp r/ d r~d ~-p r ~ , r being infinite , it will be pd ~/ d p~= f. or 2d ~/ d 2~= f , if the Lens be Glass .
If the Lens be Double-Convex , and r be equal to ~ , as being formed of Segments of equal Spheres , then will pd~ r/ d r~d~pr~ be reduced to pd r/ 2 dpr= f ; and in case d be infinite , then it will yet be farther contracted to ~p r , and p being = n/ m n the socal distance in Glass will be = r , in Water 1~ r , but in Diamant ~ r. I am sensible that these Examples are too much for the complete Analyst , though I fear too little for the less Skilful , it being very hard , if possible , in such matters , so to write as to give satisfaction to both ; or to please the one , and instruct the other .
But this may suffice to show the extent of our Theorem , and how easy a Reduction adapts any one case to all the rest .
Nor is this only useful to discover the focus from the other proposed data , but from the focus given , we may thereby determine the distance of the Object , or from the focus and distance given , we may find of what Sphere it is requisite to take another Segment , to make any given Segment of another Sphere cast the beams from the distance d to the focus f. As likewise from the Lens , focus , and distance given , to find the ratio of Refraction , or of m to n , requisite to answer those data .
All which it is obvious , are fully determined from the Equation we have hitherto used , viz. pd~r=drf~d~f pr~ f , for to find d the Theorem is pr~ f/ r f~~fp~r= d , the distance of the Object .
For ~ the Rule is dr f/ p dr~df~prf=~ But for p will be drf~d~ f/ d ~r~f~r= p , which latter determincs the ratio of Refraction , m being to n as 1~p to p. I shall not expatiate on these Particulars , but leave them for the exercise of those that are desirous to be informed in Optical Matters , which I am bold to say are comprehended in these three Rule , as fully as the most inquisitive can desire them , and in all possible cases ; regard being had to the Signs ~ and - , as in the former cases of finding the focus .
I shall only show two considerable uses of them ; the one to find the distance whereat an Object , being placed shall by a given Lens be represented in a Species as large as the Object it self , which may be of singular use , in drawing Faces , and other things in their true Magnitude , by transmitting the Species by a Glass into a dark Room , which will not only give the true Figure and Shades , but even the Colours themselves , almost as vivid as the Life .
In this case d is equal to f , and substituting d for f in the Equation , we shall have pdr~=ddr~dd ~-d p~ r , and dividing all by d. pr~=dr+d~pr p , that is 2pr ~/ r ~~= d ; but if the two Convexities be of the same Sphere so as r=~ then will the distance be =p r , that is , if the Lens be Glass =2 r , so that if an Object be placed at the Diameter of the Sphere distant in this case the focus will be as far within as the Object is without , and the Species represented thereby will be as big as the Life ; but if it were a Plano-Convex , the same distance will be =2p r , or in Glass to four times the Radius of the Convexity ; but of this method I may perhaps entertain the Curious in some other Transaction , and show how to magnify or diminish an Object in any proportion assigned , ( which yet will be obvious enough from what is here delivered ) as likewise how to erect the Object which in this method is represented inverted .
A second use is to find what Convexity or Concavity is required , to make a vastly distant Object be represented at a given focus , after the one surface of the Lens is formed ; which is but a Corollary of our Theorem for finding ~ , having p , d , r and f given ; for d being infinite , that Rule becomes r f/ p rf= ~ , that is in Glass r f/ 2 rf= p , whence if f be greater than 2 r , ~ becomes Negative , and r f/ f 2r is the Radius of the Concave sought .
Those that are wholly to begin with this Dioptrical Science cannot do better than to read with Attention a late Treatise of Dioptricks published by W. Molineux , Esq : R. S. S. who has at large shown the Nature of Optic Glasses , and the Construction and Use of Microscopes and Telescopes ; and though some nicely Critical have endeavoured to spy faults , and to traduce the Book , yet having long since examined it with care , I affirm , that if I can judge , it hath but two things that with any Colour may be called saults ; the one an over careful acknowledgment of every Trifle the Author had received from other ; and the other , that he labours to make easy this curious Subject , so little understood by most , in a manner perhaps too familiar for the Learned Critic , and which demonstrates that it was writ cum animo docendi , both which require but very little Friendship or good Nature in the Reader , to pass for Virtues in an Author .
But to return to our first Theorem , which accounting for the thickness of the Lens , we will here again resume , viz. mpdrpndpt+nprp t/ m dr~md~ -m pr~mndt+nrt= f. And let it be required to find the focus where a whole Sphere will collect the Beams proceeding from an Object at the distance d ; Here t is equal to 2r and r= ~ .
And after due Reduction the Theorem will stand thus , mpdr2ndr~2npr r/ 2 nd~2nrmpr= f , but if d be infinite , it is contracted to mp r/ 2 nr=2n m/ 2 m-2 n r=f , wherefore a Sphere of Glass collects the Suns Beams at half the Semi-diameter of the Sphere without it , and a Sphere of Water at a whole Semi-diameter .
But if the ratio of Refraction m to n be as 2 to 1 , the focus falls on the opposite surface of the Sphere , but if it be of greater inequality it falls within .
Another Example shall be when a Hemisphere is exposed to parallel Rays , that is d and ~ being infinite , and t= r , and after due Reduction the Theorem results n n/ m mmnr= f. ~ That is , in Glass it is at 4/ 3 r , in Water at 2/ 4 r , but if the Hemisphere were Diamant , it would collect the Beams at ~ of the Radius beyond the Center .
Lastly , As to the effect of turning the two sides of a Lens towards an Object ; it is evident , that if the thickness of the Lens be very small , so as that you neglect it , or account t= 0 , then in all cases the focus of the same Lens , to whatsoever Beams , will be the same , without any difference upon the turning the Lens : But if you are so Curious as to consider the thickness , ( which is seldom worth accounting for ) in the case of parallel Rays falling on a Plano-Convex of Glass , if the plain side be towards the Object , t does occasion no difference , but the focal distance f=2 r. But when the Convex side is towards the Object , it is contracted to 2r~ t , so that the focus is nearer by 2/ 3 t. If the Lens be double Convex the difference is less ; if a Meniscus greater .
If the Convexity on both sides be equal , the focal length is about ~t shorter than when t= 0 .
In a Meniscus the Concave side towards the Object increases the focal length , but the Convex towards the Object diminishes it .
A General Rule for the difference arising on turning the Lens , where the Focus is Affirmative , is this 2rt2~ t/ 3 r~3~ t , for double Convexes of differing Spheres .
But for Menisci the same difference becomes 2rt~2~ t/ 3 r3~~ t ; of which I need give no other demonstration , but that by a due Reduction it will so follow from what is premised , as will the Theorems for all-sorts ofProblems relating to the foci of Optic Glasses .
