with muriate of magnesia , it would appear to be 73 instead of 67,3 .
In recurring to the tables of KIRWAN , a similar obstacle presents itself to the determination of the quantity of muriatic acid , that is equivalent to a given weight of sulphuric acid .
When the comparison is made by means of potash , the result would make it appear that 68,3 is the relative weight of muriatic acid .
But , if the compounds of these acids with lime be employed in the computation , the result instead of 68,3 gives only 59 .
RICHTER remarked , on observing this sort of inconsistency , that if sulphate of potash formed according to the proportions of KIRWAN were decomposed by muriate of lime , there should be found a large excess of alkali in the solution .
But , on the contrary , by direct experiment he found that neutral salts , when mixed , remained in all cases neutral , and consequently , that the same weight of muriatic acid would in all cases be found equivalent to the same quantity of sulphuric acid ; and therefore might be conveniently expressed in stating the composition of salts , by the same number .
He estimates this acid at 712 , as the equivalent to iooo dry sulphuric acid , the number assumed as his standard of comparison , to which all other numbers for acids , alkalies , and earths are adapted .
It could not escape the penetration of M. BERTIIOLLET , that there exist numerous deviations from this law of neutralization , and cases of prevailing affinity dependent on a redundance of one or other ingredient in a mixture of salts .
But he was not so happy in detecting the definite law , by which many , at least , of these deviations are governed .
It has since been found , that when a base unites with a larger portion of acid 4 than is sufficient to saturate it , the quantity combined is then an exact simple multiple of the former , thus exhibiting a new modification of the law of definite proportions , rather than any exception to it .
The first instance in which the same body was supposed to unite with different doses of another , in such proportions that one of these doses is a simple multiple of the other , was noticed by Mr. HIGGINS , who conceived , rather than actually observed to occur , certain successive degrees of oxidation of azote , and represented the series of its combinations with oxygen to be * Azote i with 2 oxygen making nitrous gas .
Azote i with 3 oxygen making red nitrous vapour .
Azote i with 4 oxygen making yellow nitrous acid .
Azote 1 with 5 oxygen making white nitric acid .
He at the same time added his opinion , that such are the proportions in which these gases unite to each other by bulk , having before observed one instance of union by exactly double bulk in the formation of water by the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen , and expressed his persuasion that the number of particles in a given bulk of the different gases is the same , and that the number of particles in the compounds of azote and oxygen , are successively in the proportions above stated .
But though Mr. HIGGINS , in the instance of the union of hydrogen with oxygen , anticipated the law of bulks observed by M. GAY LUSSAC , with respect to the union of gases , and in his conception of union by ultimate particles clearly preceded Mr. DALTON in his atomic views of chemical combination , he appears not f to have taken much pains to ascertain the actual prevalence of that law of multiple proportions by which the atomic theory is best supported , and it is in fact to Mr. DALTON that we are indebted for the first correct observation of such an instance of a simple multiple in the union of nitrous gas with oxygen .
In his endeavours to determine the composition of the atmosphere , he found that the quantity of oxygen contained in ioo measures of common air would combine with either 36 or 7e measures of nitrous gas , according to certain variations in the mode of conducting the experiment.* Chemists in general , however , appear to have been by no means duly impressed with the importance of this observation of Mr. DALTON , till they were in possession of other facts observed by Dr. THOMSON and myself , in a more tangible form , with regard to neutral and superacid or subacid salts , which could be made the subjects of more deliberate and less equivocal experiments ; and it is , perhaps , owing to the repetition and confirmation of them by M. BERTHOLLET , .
that they have attracted the attention of other chemists , who are now ready to admit that the term binacid correctly expresses the relation of many superacid salts to neutrals consisting of the same ingredients .
Since that time the additional instances in which the same law has been observed to prevail , are become so numerous , especially with regard to different degrees of oxidation , that we have the greatest reason to presume that the colourless contains about five of dephlogisticated to one of phlogisticated air .
Comparative View , p. 84 .
it is universal , and that in such analyses as are found not to accord with this general observation , we are warranted in suspecting some degree of inaccuracy in one or other of the results compared together .
According to Mr. DALTON'S theory , by which these facts are best explained , chemical union in the state of neutralization takes place between single atoms of the substances combined ; and in cases where there is a redundance of either ingredient , then two or more atoms of this kind are united to only one of the other .
According to this view , when we estimate the relative weights of equivalents , Mr. DALTON conceives that we are estimating the aggregate weights of a given number of atoms , and consequently the proportion which the ultimate single atoms bear to each other .
But since it is impossible in several instances , where only two combinations of the same ingredients are known , to discover which of the compounds is to be regarded as consisting of a pair of single atoms , and since the decision of these questions is purely theoretical , and by no means necessary to the formation of a table adapted to most practical purposes , I have not been desirous of warping my numbers according to an atomic theory , but have endeavoured to make practical convenience my sole guide , and have considered the doctrine of simple multiples , on which that of atoms is founded , merely as a valuable assistant in determining , by simple division , the amount of those quantities that are liable to such definite deviations from the original law of RICHTER .
Having some time since computed for private use a series of supposed atoms , I had assumed oxygen as the decimal unit of my scale , in order to facilitate the estimation of those numerous combinations which it forms with other bodies .
But , though in the present table of Equivalents , I have retained the same unit , and have taken care to make oxygen equally prominent for the same reason as before , as well as on account of the important part it performs in determining the affinities of bodies by the different proportions in which it is united to them ; nevertheless the real measure , by which most bodies are compared to each other , in any experiments that I have made , and to which I have , in fact , endeavoured to find equivalents , is a determinate quantity of carbonate of lime .
This is a compound , that may be regarded as most distinctly neutral .
It is most easy to obtain in a state of uniform purity ; most easy to analyse ( as a binary compound ) ; it is a most convenient measure for the powers of acids , and affords the most distinct expression for the comparative neutralizing powers of alkalies , The first question , consequently , to be resolved is , by what number are we to express the relative weight of carbonic acid , if oxygen be fixed at 1o .
It seems to be very well ascertained , that a given quantity of oxygen yields exactly an equal measure of carbonic acid by union with carbon ; and since the specific gravities of these gases are as 10 to 13,77 , * or as 20 to 27,54 , the weight of carbon may be justly represented by 7,54 , which , in this instance , is combined with 2 of oxygen fcrming the deutoxide , and carbonic oxide being the protoxide will be duly represented by 17,54 .
Carbonic acid having consequently been assumed as 27,54 , it follows from the analysis of carbonate of lime , which by heat loses 43,7 per cent , of acid , and leaves 56,3 of base , that they are combined in the proportion of 27,54 to 35,46 , and consequently that lime must be represented by 35,46 , and carbonate of lime by 63 .
If I would proceed in the series for the purpose of estimating the reliance to be placed on preceding analyses , I might dissolve 63 of carbonate of lime in muriatic acid , and by evaporating to perfect dryness should obtain about 69,56 muriate of lime , and by deducting the weight of the lime 35,46 should learn , by means of the difference 34,1 , what is to be considered as dry muriatic acid .
But since lime is now known , by the brilliant discoveries of Sir H. DAVY , to be a metallic body united with oxygen , this salt may also be viewed as a binary compound in a different light as oxymuriate of calcium ; in which case we must transfer the weight of lo oxygen to the muriatic acid , making 44,1 of oxymuriatic acid combined with 25,46 calcium .
Or , lastly , if with the same distinguished chemist , we regard it as chlorid of calcium , its place in the scale of equivalents is the same 69,56 , and the portion of matter here added to the calcium , whether it retain its late name of oxymuriatic acid , or revert to its original one of dephlogisticated marine acid , or assume its new one of chlorine , will be rightly represented by 44,1 , which expresses a bare fact without reference to any theory , and affords the means of estimating the proportion of this constituent in all muriatic compounds , without need of controversy respecting its simple or compound nature , which may * In Dr. MARcET 's experiments on the composition of muriate of lime , referred to in his Analysis of the Water of the Dead Sea , 50,77 carbonate gave 56,1 of muriate of lime , and 50,77 : 56 , : 63 : 69,6 never admit of any argument that will be deemed conclusive by all parties .
With the same latitude of interpretation may be understood muriate of potash or of soda in the scale of equivalents ; and the relative weights of mere potash or soda may , perhaps , be determined better by means of these compounds than by any other , because they are not liable to be superacid , and are not decomposed by heat .
If to a quantity of muriatic acid , which , by previous trial , I know would dissolve 100 carbonate of lime , I add loo grains of crystallized carbonate of potash , and after the addition find that it will dissolve only 49,8 of carbonate of lime ; I hence infer that 1oo of this carbonate is equivalent to 50,2 carbonate of lime , and consequently that 125.5 is the equivalent to 63 in the table .
Next , if I combine 125,5 of crystallized carbonate of potash with an excess of muriatic acid , and evaporate to dryness , I expel the whole of the water with all redundant acid , and I find 93,2 of neutral salt ; and whether I call it muriate of potash , or chlorid of potassium , or by any other name , with any other views , 'I may deduct 34,1 as dry muriatic acid , ( whether real or imaginary* ) and infer the equivalent for potash to be 59,1 , even though there should , in fact , be only 49,1 of potassium present , requiring lot of oxygen to convert it into potash .
The next question that occurs relates to the composition of this crystallized carbonate of potash , which I am induced to call bi-carbonate of potash , for the purpose of marking moredecidedly the distinction between this salt and that which is commonly called a subcarbonate , * and in order to refer at once to the double dose of carbonic acid contained in it .
With reference to carbonate of lime also , I must necessarily consider it as a supercarbonate , for if I add a solution of this salt to a neutral solution of muriate of lime , a considerable effervescence takes place , from a redundance of carbonic acid beyond what is necessary to saturate the lime .
If I'saturate 125,5 of this salt with .
nitric acid , taking due precaiotions not to expel any of the fluid along with the gas which escapes , it loses about 55of carbonic acid , which is the double of 27,5 .
But if , previous to the saturation , I heat the salt moderately red , it loses 38,8 , consisting of 27,5 carbonic acid and 11,3 water , after w'ich the addition of an acid expels only 27,5 , or a single dose of carbonic acid .
I have in this experiiment made use of nitric acid , in order that the resulting compound might guide me in the selection from among former estimates which are extremely discordant with regard to the equivalent of that acid .
The proportion of nitrate of potash , which I have obtained by evaporating such a solution by a heat just sufficient to fuse the residuum , gave at the lowest in three experiments 26 , for the equivalent of nitrate of potash ; from which , if we deduct 59,1 potash , there will remain 66,9 as the apparent equivalent of dry nitric acid .
Consequently , I have no hesitation in preferring the estimate * to be obtained from RICHTER'S analysis of nitrate of potash , which gives 67,45 , from which if we subtract one portion of azote 17,54 , there remain 49,91 , so nearly 5 portions of oxygen , that I consider the truth to be 17,54 + 50 , or 67.54 .
From this sketch of the mode in which such an inquiry may be pursued , wherever it is necessary to make any original experiments , it will be fully understood what is meant by equivalents , and in what manner the series might be continued .
I have , however , in most instances drawn my inferences from former analyses , and indeed in all , where I could find coincidences between different authorities sufficient to give confidence in their results .
But with respect to oxalic acid , I again found a difficulty in deciding among the discordant results of different analyses , and was obliged to have recourse to direct experiment .
loo grains of bin-oxalate of potash ( commonly called salt of sorrel ) were subjected to a degree of heat sufficient to destroy the oxalic acid , and to convert the salt into a subcarbonate of potash .
A quantity of muriatic acid was then poured on this residuum , and afterwards saturated with carbonate of lime ; and an equal quantity of the same acid was saturated with carbonate of lime alone .
By the excess of carbonate dissolved in the latter instance , it was found that ioo bin-oxalate was equivalent to 40,9 carbonate of lime ; and hence the equivalent to 63 carbonate of lime will be 154 of the binoxalate of potash .
After deducting 59,1 potash , the remainder + 46,7 : 53,3 : 59,1 : 67,45 quoted in Mem. d'Arcueil , II .
59 .
94,9 divided by 2 , gives 47,45 for the equivalent of dry oxalic acid .
I therefore again adopt the result of the very industrious and ever accurate BERZELIUS , obtained by means of oxalate of lead , that 296,6* litharge are combined with loo oxalic acid , which are in the proportion of 139,5 litharge to 47 , o oxalic acid .
Such a degree of accordance between methods totally different appears highly satisfactory , and seems to show that in attempts to determine the same point by means of lime , some compounds may possibly be formed at the same time differing in the proportions of acid and base , as in the cases of oxalate and bin-oxalate of strontia , observed by Dr. THOMSON , and that erroneous inferences may have been drawn from precipitates in which they are blended .
With the exception of those instances that I have enumerated , there are few in which I have found it necessary to make any new experiments , as I have met with coincidences between the independent results of others sufficient to satisfy me of their correctness ; and accordingly I have adopted such determinations without any pretensions to improve upon them by new experiments of my own .
It is not my design in the table which follows this paper , to attempt a complete enumeration of all those elements or compounds which I suppose to be well ascertained , but merely to include some of those which most frequently occur .
I do not offer it as an attempt to correct the estimates that have been formed by others , but as a method in which their results may be advantageously applied in forming an easy approximation to any object of our inquiries .
The means by which this is effected may be in part understood by inspection of the Plate I. , in which will be seen the ' Ann. de Chimie , No. 243 .
1 , s list of substances intended to be estimated , arranged on one or the other-side of a scale of numbers in the order of their relative weights , and at such distances from each other , according to their weights , that the series of numbers placed on a sliding scale can at pleasure be moved , so that any number expressing theweight of a compound may be brought to correspond with the place of that compound in the adjacent column .
The arrangement is then such , that the weight of any ingredient in its composition , of any reagent to be employed , or precipitate that might be obtained in its analysis , will be found opposite to the point at which its respective name is placed .
In order to show more clearly the use of this scale , the Plate exhibits two different situations of the slider , in one of which oxygen is lo , and other bodies are in their due proportion to it , so that carbonic acid being 27,54 , and lime 35,46 , carbonate of lime is placed at 63 .
In the second figure , the slider is represented drawn upwards till oo corresponds to muriate of soda ; and accordingly the scale then shows how much of each substance contained in the table is equivalent to loo of common salt .
It shows , with regard to the different views of the analysis of this salt , that it contains 46,6 dry muriatic acid , and 53,4 of soda , or 39,8 sodium , and 13,6 oxygen ; or if viewed as chlorid of sodium , that it contains 6Co , chlorine , and 39,8 sodium .
With respect to reagents , it may be seen that 283 nitrate of lead , containing 191 of litharge employed to separate the muriatic acid , would yield a precipitate of 237 muriate of lead , and that there would then remain in solution nearly 146 nitrate of soda .
It may at the same time be seen , that the acid in this quantity of salt would serve to make 32 corrosive sublimate containing 185,5 red oxide of mercury , or would make 91,5 nuriate of ammonia , composed of 6 muriatic gas ( or hydromuriatic acid ) and 29,5 amnmotnia .
The scale shows also , that for the purpose of obtaining the whole of the acid in distillation the quantity of oil of vitriol required is nearly 84 , and that the residuum of this distillation would be 122 dry sulphate of soda , from which might be obtained , by crystallization , 277 of GLAUBER salt containing 155 water of crystallization .
These and many more such answers appear at once by bare inspection , as soon as the weight of any substance intended for examination is made by motion of the slider correctly to correspond with its place in the adjacent column .
With respect to the method of laying down the divisions of this scale , those who are accustomed to the use of other sliding-rules , and are practically acquainted with their properties , will recognise upon the slider itself the common GUNTER'S line of numbers , ( as it is termed ) and will be satisfied that the results which it gives are the same that would be obtained by arithmetical computation .
Those who are acquainted with the doctrine of ratios , and with the use of logarithms as measures of ratios , will understand the principle on which this scale is founded , and will not need to be told that all the : divisions are logometric , and consequently that the mechanical addition and subtraction of ratios here performed by juxta-position , corresponds in effect to the multiplication and division of the numbers by which those ratios are expressed in common arithmetical notation .
To others who are not equally conversant with the nature of logarithms , and consequently have not so correct a concept tion of the magnitudes of ratios , some further explanation of the mode in which the scale of equivalents is constructed , will , I presume , be acceptable .
They will observe , that the series of natural numbers are not placed at equal intervals on the scale ; but that at all equal intervals are found numbers which bear the same proportion to each other .
In fig. 3 , some of the larger intervals alone are represented on a line similarly divided .
The succession of intervals , marked A , B , C , D , E , are all equal , and at these points of division are placed numbers 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , i6 , which increase progressively by the same ratio .
And since the series 3 : 6:12 : 24 increase in the same ratio of i to 2 , these intervals a , b , c , d , e , are the same as the former .
At another succession of different yet equal intervals , marked F , G , H , I , are placed numbers i , 3 , 9 , 27 , which increase regularly by an equal ratio of i to 3 ; and by means of a pair of compasses it would be found that the interval from 2 to 6 , or from 6 to i8 ( which are in the same ratio of 1 to 3 , ) is exactly equal to FG , the interval between i and 3 .
As any single space represents any one ratio , so the sum of any 2 or 3 equal spaces represent a double or triple ratio .
If 1 be increased three times by the ratio of 1 to 2 , it becomes 8 , which bears to X triple the ratio of 2 to i. This ratio is therefore rightly represented by AD , which is the triple of AB .
The distances of the intermediate numbers 5 , 7 , 1o , 11 , 13 , &amp;c. from i are likewise made proportional to the ratios which they bear to i , and are easily laid down by means of a table of logarithms ; for as these are arithmetic measures of the ratios which all numbers bear to unity , the spaces proportional to them become linear representations of the same quantities .
As the entire spaces AD , AE represent the ratios of 8 and of 16 respectively to I , so the difference DE represents the ratio of 8 and 16 , which stand at D and E , to each other .
And in the same manner , any other space kl represents correctly the ratio of 7 to 13 ; so that the measure of a fraction expressed by quantities that are incommensurate is rendered as obvious to sight , as that of any simple multiple .
And if a pair of compasses be opened to this interval , and transferred to any other part of the scale , the points of the compasses will be found to rest upon numbers bearing the same proportion to each other as those from which the interval was transferred , It is exactly in this manner , that the various points in the column of equivalents indicate the several quantities sought in any given position of the slider .
The relative distances , at which the articles are placed , represent so many different openings of the compasses rendered permanent and presented to view at once .
In the table , which I shall place at , the end of this communication , the relation of the various substances enumerated to each other is expressed by numbers .
In the engraved scale of equivalents , the ratios of these numbers are represented by logometric intervals at which they are placed , their several positions being determined by those of their respective numbers on the slider , which is logometrically divided .
Consequently all the several points in the column of equivalents will indicate numbers in the same due proportions to each other , whatever part of the scale may be presented to them .
Those who seek information may obtain it by inspection ; those Who already possess it , may be able to correct the positions of some articles by direct comparison with the best analyses upon record , in whatever numbers the results of those analyses may happen to be expressed .
I hope , that without trespassing too much on the time of the Society , I shall have rendered the principle and practical use of this scale intelligible .
I trust , that it will prove useful as an assistant to chemists in general .
It will at least serve for a specimen of the extreme facility of mechanical approximation , which may very frequently be advantageously substituted for computations , that are often more laborious than the accuracy of our data warrants ; and if it tend to introduce into more general use , that valuable instrument the common sliding-rule , it will be the means of saving no inconsiderable portion of time to those who are engaged in scientific pursuits .

In this table I have selected in most cases double evidence from different sources , in order that the inferences might receive confirmation from their concurrence .
Number ( 29 ) may be noticed as a result anticipated from preceding data , and found to coincide with remarkable accuracy .
In the distillation of nitric acid from nitre , the whole of the acid may be obtained , if we employ enough of sulphuric acid to convert the residuum into bi-sulphate of potash .
In this case each portion of potash , from which dry nitric acid is separated , will displace the water from two equivalent quantities of sulphuric acid , and each portion of nitric acid weighing 67,5will be found combined with 22,64 of water .
Hence 90,18 of liquid nitric acid so obtained should dissolve the equivalent 63 of carbonate of lime .
And in fact , by an experiment carefully conducted on a large scale by Mr. PfIILLIPS , * it appears that 681of suchlacid did dissolve 476 of marble , which is in the propcrtion of 9o,18 to 62,96 , corresponding with the estimate within -rTo part , a degree of coincidence rarely to be found even in the repetition of the same experiment by the most skilful analyst .
The specific gravity of this acid was found to be 1,50 .

I. A Synoptic Scale of Chemical Equivalents .
By William Hyde Wollaston , M. D. Sec. R. S. Read November 4 , 1813 , WHEN the nature of any saline compound is proposed as the subject of inquiry to an analytic chemist , the questions that occur for his consideration are so varied and so numerous , that he will seldom be disposed to undertake a series of original experiments for the purpose of satisfying his inquiries , so long as he can rely upon the accuracy of those results that have been obtained by the labour of others , who have preceded him in this field of patient investigation .
If , for instance , the salt under examination be the common blue vitriol , or crystallized sulphate of copper , the first obvious questions are , ( 1 ) How much sulphuric acid does it contain ?
( 2 ) How much oxide of copper ?
( 3 ) How much water ?
He may not be satisfied with these first steps in the analysis , but may desire to know further the quantities ( 4 ) of sulphur , ( 5 ) of copper , ( 6 ) of oxygen , ( 7 ) of hydrogen .
As means of gaining this information , he naturally considers the quanMDccCXIV .
B tities of various reagents that may be employed for discovering the quantity of sulphuric acid , ( 8 ) how much barytes , ( 9 ) carbonate of barytes , or ( o1 ) nitrate of barytes , would be requisite for this purpose ; ( 1 ) How much lead is to be used in the form of ( 12 ) nitrate of lead ; and when the precipitate of ( 13 ) sulphate of barytes or ( 14 ) sulphate of lead are obtained , it will be necessary that he should also know the proportion which either of them contains of dry sulphuric acid .
He may also endeavour to ascertain the same point by means of ( 15 ) the quantity of pure potash , or ( i6 ) of carbonate of potash requisite for the precipitation of the copper .
He might also use ( i7 ) zinc or ( 18 ) iron for the same purpose , and he may wish to know the quantities of ( 19 ) sulphate of zinc , or ( 2o ) sulphate of iron that will then remain in the solution .
These , and very many more questions of the same kind , which it would be tedious to specify , and needless to enumerate , engage the thoughts , and will occupy much of the time of every experimental chemist , unless he can have recourse to some record of former analyses on which he can depend .
The scale , which I am about to describe , is designed to answer at one view all these questions , with reference to most of the salts contained in the table , not merely expressing numerically the proportions by which the desired answers may be calculated , but directly indicating the actual weights of the several ingredients , contained in any assumed weight of the salt under consideration , and also the actual quantities of several reagents that may be used , and of the precipitates that would be obtained by each .
In the formation of this scale , it is requisite in the first place to determine the proportions in which the different known chemical bodies unite with each other , and to express these proportions in such terms that the same substance shall always be represented by the same number .
It is to RICHTER that we are originally indebted for this mode of expression , and for having first observed that law of permanent proportions on which the possibility of this numerical representation is founded .
The proportions assigned to various salts by his predecessors BERGMAN , WENZEL , KIRWAN , were incompatible with this mode of notation .
If we turn to BERGMAN'S treatise De Analysi Aquarum , we find it stated that in sulphate of potash 40 of acid are combined with 5S of potash , or that ioo of sulphuric acid take 130 of potash .
In muriate of potash , 61 of the alkali are said to be combined with 31 of acid , which is in the proportion of 130 to 66 .
So that the same quantity of potash that is saturated by 1oo sulphuric acid , requires of muriatic 66 .
But if we make a similar estimate by means of lime , since sulphate of lime is said to contain 46 acid combined with 3g lime , 1oo of acid would require 69,5 .
And in muriate of lime , since 44 of lime are said to be combined with 31 of acid , thence 69,5 of lime would require 49 .
So that in this instance it would appear that the equivalent to 1oo sulphuric acid , instead of being 66 muriatic , is 49 ; which , if true , would defeat our attempts to express the same body always by the same number .
In comparing the analyses of WENZEL with each other , we find the same inconsistency .
If we select sulphate of ammonia , and muriate of ammonia , we obtain 67,3 as the equivalent of muriatic acid .
But by comparison of sulphate of magnesia B a
