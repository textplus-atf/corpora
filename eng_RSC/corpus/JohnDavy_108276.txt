On the Temperature of Man .
By JOHN DAVY , M.D. , F.R.S.L. 8f E. , Inspector-General of Army Hospitals .
Received May 8 , -Read June 19 , 1845 .
IT has been too generally taken for granted that the temiperature of man in health , as measured by a thermometer placed under the tongue , is a constant one .
I have endeavoured to prove from the results of observations , that this is not strictly correct ; that when not disturbed by disease it is subject to variation , to rise and fall under certain influences , especially of heat and cold , rest and exercise* .
In the present communication I propose to submit to the Royal Society some further observations on the same subject , made with an instrument bettel adapted for the inquiry than the medical thermometer commonly used , and which has afforded results of a precise and satisfactory kind .
The thermometer I have employed is a bent one , about twelve inches and a half long , its bulb about an inch long , and , where widest , half an inch thick ; its curvature about three and a half inches from the bulb , and its stem , to which the scale is attached , nearly at right angles to the bulb , so that when inserted under the tongue , the observer has no difficulty in distinguishing accurately the degrees himself , whether nearsighted or the contrary ; in the latter instance using merely a common magnifying glass .
Each degree of the scale is a little more than half an inch ( '6 inch ) , and is divided into ten parts ; and each of these parts is sufficiently large to admit of subdivision by the eye .
It may be right to premise a few words regarding the manner of observing with this instrument ; and to notice some precautions which it is necessary to take to avoid error .
First , as to the placing of the thermometer : it is requisite that the bulb should be introduced under the tongue , and as far back as possible ; and that whilst in the mouth , respiration should be carried on entirely through the nostrils .
If the thermometer is placed in the side of the mouth , between the teeth and the cheek , the temperature indicated is from three-tenths to one-tenth of a degree less , according to the degree of coldness of the atmosphere .
Next , as to time : it is necessary that the thermometer remain in the mouth many minutes , till the observer is sure that the maximum height is attained .
If the mouth has been kept closed for a quarter of an hour previously , a shorter time is required , than if allowed to be open and the passage of respiration .
This is well shown by trials with the thetnometer raised a few degrees above the temperature of the mouth before introduction .
In the one case , the thermometer slowly falls to the temperature of the mouth , and is stationary ; in the other case , after having fallen it again rises , continuing to rise till the maximum temperature of the closed mouth is acquired .
The observations which I have made with this thermometer have been altogether on myself ; it would have been difficult indeed to have made them on another , with the requisite degree of accuracy , as they are tedious , demanding so much time and care .
They were begun in August last , and have been continued almost daily up to the present time , with the exception of the greater part of the month of October , when they were interrupted until a second thermometer could be procured to supply the place of the first , which was then broken , and which was even more delicate than the second .
It was my intention to have extended them to a period of twelve months before collecting the results ; but this I am not able to accomplish , having received an order to prepare and hold myself in readiness for foreign service .
Abroad I hope to be able to continue them , and as that will be in a tropical climate , I am the more desirous of communicating now the information I have already obtained ; the comparison of the two sets may prove interesting .
In conjunction with the temperature under the tongue , I have in most instances noticed the pulse and respiration , considering it a desideratum so to do , and with the hope that the observations on the latter may be useful data , and may in some measure tend to throw light on the former , there being such an intiimate connexion between them .
The posture in which the pulse and respiration have been counted has always been a sitting one .
Of the many problems which might be proposed regarding the temperature of the body , I shall now only touch on a small number ; and I shall be well-pleased if the information I have to give shall be considered merely as a contribution towards their solution , a beginning of an inquiry to be extended .
1 .
Of the Variation of Temperature during the twenty-four hours .
To endeavour to determine what is the extent of this variation , I have made on several occasions , observations every second or third hour , from the time of rising to that of going to rest , confining myself to the house during the whole time and to rooms of nearly the same temperature , the greater part of it , and varying but little my occupation .
The following for a single day will give a pretty accurate idea of the esult : Temperature Pulse .

These observations I shall give in detail in tables appended ; here it may be sufficient to notice the mean of each month 's observations .

During this period , comprising eight months , the health of the observer ( aged fiftyfive ) was pretty good , almost uninterruptedly so , excepting in Decelnber and January , when he experienced slight lumbago , not preventing the taking of exercise ; and fori a few days in November and January an attack of catarrll in a mild form .
As I wish to be as concise as possible , I shall comment very little on the results of the summary of observations .
They seem to prove in a decided manner that the temperature under the tongue , when under no disturbing influence , is about its maximum after waking after the repose of the night ; that it continues high , but fluctuating more or less ( probably owing to disturbing circumstances ) till towards nightfall ; and that it is lowest about midnight .
Its lowness at the last-mentioned time is the more remarkable , as the temperature of the room in which the observer sat at night was almost uniformly higher than of that which he occupied during the day .

Of the Variation of Temperature during different seasons of the year .
The following Table exhibits the mean results of the observations made during the eight mnonths , at the different periods of the day , both of the temperature under the tongue and of the air of the room .

98-37 55.5 2u2 321 These results give an average tertperature of 98*4 , that of the air being about 55*5 .
They show a slight relation between the temperatule of the body and of the ail , but less perhaps than might be expected , and less unquestionably than would have been exhibited under circumstances not equally favourable for the preseirvation of an equable warmth , especially at night , in the uniform temperature of the sittingroom ; and when at rest , from warml bed-clothes , and during the day from sitting in cold weather near a fire , and from the clothing then , as well as at night , being varied with the degree of cold to be resisted , having in view the preserving of an agreeable feeling .
The effect and perllaps best sign of the happy temperate mean in some facts which I shall have presently to bring forward , may aid in illustrating the remark just made .
3 .
Of the Effect of Active Exercise on the Temperature .
By active exercise , I mean that which occasions acceleration of the heart 's action , and of respiration , and commonly a feeling of incrleased warmth , such as fast walking and riding , in contradistinction to the passive kind , as that which is taken in an easy carriage .

322 Of the Effect of Carriage Exercise on the Temperature .
The observations which follow , were made immediately after getting out of the carriage , which was a close one , and its windows commonly closed ; and the dress worn , at the time of being out , was warm .

These results are strongly contrasted with those given in the preceding section , showing the exalting effect of active exercise on the temperature .
I have other results , equally proving how gentle exercise , in a cold atmosphere , has a depressing effect , whether taken in a carriage , on horseback , or on foot , walking slowly .
5 .
Of the Effect of Exposure to Cold Air without exercise .
The few observations I have collected on this point , have been made the instant after returning from an adjoining church , the temperature of which in the cold weather of winter is little above the freezing-point , no attempt being made to warml it , and the congregation which assembles in it at that season being small .

1 P.M. 95'9 44 16 32 In each of the above instances , in spite of warm clothing , the sensation experienced by the obserlver was that of disagreeable chilliness , and in the feet and hands , of coldness ; a feeling of drowsiness was also perceived , as if the condition induced were an approach to the state of temperature of a hybernating animal , or to that which is probably the prelude to the sleep in the human being resulting from long exposure to severe cold without exercise .
6 .
Of the Effect of Excited and Sustained Attention on the Temperature .
The state of mind referred to is that accompanied with exertion , such as is experienced in composition , or in reading a work of exciting interest .
The observations which follow have been made entirely at night , after from two to five hours of sustained attention .
Many more were made by day ; but these are not given , as they are not so well fitted for comparison .
323 These observations show an increase of mind .
Though the increase is slight , yet I temperature after sustained exertion of think it must be admitted to be decided , comparing the mean ( 98'4 ) with the average result of the observations ( 97'92 ) made at the same period of the twenty-four hours , when the attention was not roused , when it was rather in a passive indolent state , as in reading merely for amusement , ol in the mechanical process of copying writing , both which seem to have , as is indeed generally believed , rather a sedative influence than an exciting one ; and are to the former very like what passive bodily exercise is to active muscular exertion .
7 .
Of the Effect of taking Food on the Temperature .
The following observations were made after rising from the dinner-table , at which the observer commonly sat down at 5 o'clock , and partook pretty fully , using a mixed diet , -never taking anything between the breakfast and dinner-hour , and using wine commonly at the latter meal , to the extent of three or four glasses , to the exclusion of malt liquor .

In the observer 's case , as in most others , drowsiness followed this meal , thus approximating the condition of the animal system to that which precedes sleep .
On particular occasions , when a larger quantity of wine than usual was taken , the reduction of temperature was commonly most strongly marked .
A light meal , such as that of breakfast , consisting of tea , with a portion of toasted bread with butter , and often an egg , has had little effect in depressing or altering materially the temperature .
It may be noticed , as regards the habits of the observer , in connexion with the observations on temperature made at a late hour , that after dinner he never took solid food , only two or three cups of tea , and this about 8 P.M. The preceding observations , generally considered , appear to indicate clearly that the temperature of man , as determined in the manner described ; is like the animal functions and secretions , constantly fluctuating within certain limits ; and like them , observing in its fluctuation a certain order , constituting as it were two series ; one regular , as the diurnal , connected with rest and refreshment from rest ; the other , casual or accidental , depending on varying circumstances of irregular occurrence , as exercise , mental exertion , exposure to heat , and the contrary .
As the observations brought forward have been made on one individual , the inferences from them as regards extended application , can be held to be only probable , but probable , I cannot but think , in a high degree , the average temperature of the observer being nowise peculiar ; and the results moreover being what might be expected reasoning on the subject , taking for data the proportions of oxygen which have been ascertained to be consumed , and of carbonic acid evolved in respiration , at different periods of the twenty-four hours , and under different circumstances .
Should observations similarly made on others present the like results ( and I cannot but be confident that they will ) , more particular inferences may be drawn from them , especially in conjunction with respiration and the heart 's action , not without interest to physiology ; and they may admit of important practical application to the regulation of clothing , the taking of exercise , the warming of dwelling-rooms , in brief , to various measures conducive to comfort , the prevention of disease , and its cure .
A step in advance is made , if it is only determined , as I believe it to be , that in the healthiest condition of the system , there is danger attending either extreme , either of low uniform temperature , or of a high uniform temiperature , and that the circumstances which are proper to regulate variability within certain limits , not prevent it , are those which conduce most to health , as well as to agreeable sensation , enjoyment and length of life .

325 The Tables which follow , containing the monthly observations , require little additional explanation .
It may be right to state , that they do not include the observations made under the influence of accidental disturbing circumstances , as active exercise , &amp;c. , the most distinct of which have been given apart in a section appropriated to them .
The observations in these Tables , made under ordinary circumstances , or nearly such , will , I believe , be useful for comparison with the former , and I would hope , for reference , in progress of inquiry .
In most instances , it will be found on comparison , that an unusual elevation of temperature has been followed by unwonted depression , and vice versed .
