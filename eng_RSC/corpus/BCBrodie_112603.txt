( Abstract .
) In chemical transformations the absolute weight of matter is unialtered , and every chemical change , as regards weight , is a change in its arrangement and distribution .
Now this distribution of weight is subject to numerical laws , and the object of the present method is to facilitate the study of these laws , by the aid of symbolic processes .
The data of the chemical calculus , as indeed of every other application of symbols to the investigation of natural phenomenia , are supplied by observation and experiment ; and its aim is simply to deduce from these data the various consequences which may be inferred from them .
The provinice of such a method commences where that of experiment terminates .
This part comprises the consideration of the fundamental principles of symbolic expression in chemistry , and also the application of the method to the solution of perhaps the most importanit of all chemical problems , ramely ; the questioni of the true composition , as regards weight , of the units of chemical substances .
Section I. In the first section certain definitions are given of those weights and relations of weight , of which the svmbols are subsequently considered .
It may be regarded as containing an analysis of the subject of chemical investigation .
The definitions are of " a chemical substance , " " a weight , " " a single weight , " " a group of weights , " " identical weights , " " a compound weight , " " a simple weight , " and " an integral compound weight .
" The unit of a cheinical substalnce is defined as that weight of the substance which at 00 Centigrade , and 760 millims. pressure and in the condition of a perfect gas , occupies the volume of 1000 cubic centimetres .
This volume is termed the unit of space .
Section II .
The second section treats of symbolic expression in chemistry .
A " chemnical operation " is defined as an operation of which the result is a weight .
These operationis are symbolized by letters , x , y , &amp;c. An interpretation is assigned to the symbols + and - , as the symbols of aggregation and segregation , that is , of the mental operations by which groups are formed .
The symbol _ is selected as the syinbol of cheemical identity ; the symbol 0 as the symbol of the absence of a weight , this symbol being identical with x-x .
The symbol ( x+x ) is the symbol of two weights collectively considered , and as constituting a whole .
The symbols xy and x are selected as the symbols of compound weights , yI and it is proved that with this interpretation these symbols are subject to the commutative and distributive laws , CCy=YXI x ( y + Y1)= xy + xy1 , and also to the index law , ^ , Pzq = zP+17 Section III .
treats of the properties and interpretation of the chemical symbol 1 , which is selected as the symbol of the subject of chemical operations , namely , the unit of space .
With this interpretationl the chemical symbol 1 has the property of the numerical symbol 1 given in the equation xl =X .
Section IV .
Chemical symbols are here shown to be subject to a special symbolic law , given in the equation xy=x+y .
This property , by which chemical symnbols are distinguished from the symbols employed in other symbolic methods , is termed the " logarithmic " property of these symibols .
A consequence of this property is that 0=1 , and that any number of numerical symbols may be added to a chemical function without affecting its interpretation as regards weight .
Section V. relates to the special properties of the symbols of simple weights , which are termed prime factors , from their analogy to the priime factors of numbers .
These symbols differ , however , from these factors in that , like the numerical symbol 1 , they are incapable of partitioni as well as of division , which is a consequence of the condition xy=x+y .
The symbol of the unit of a chemical substance , expressed as a function of the simple weights of which it consists , is identical with the.symbol of a whole riumber expressed by means of its prime factor , a " , V , 1"2 ... .
A general method is given for discovering the prime factors of chernical symbols .
Section VI .
is on the construction of chemical equations from experimental data .
Section VII .
On the expression of chemical symbols by means of prime factors in the actual system of chemical equations .
The object of this section is to prove that the units of weight of chemical substanices are integral compound weights , and to discover the simplest expression for the symbols which is consistent with this assumptioni .
Such an expression cannot be effected unless some one symbol be determined from external considerations .
The unit of hydrogen , therefore , is assumed to consist of one simple weight , its symbol being expressed by one prime factor , a , which is termed the viodulus of the symbolic system .
This assertion is the expression of a hypothesis which may be proved or disproved by facts , and the consequences of which are here traced .
The symbols of the elements are considered in three groups .
1 .
The symbols of the elements of which the density in the gaseous conditionl can be experimentally determined , and which form with one another gaseous combinations .
2 .
The symbols of carbon , boron , and silicon .
3 .
The symbols of other elements , which are determined with a certain probability by the aid of the law of Dulong .
For the method of constructing these symbols , which depends upon the solution in whole numbers of certain simple indeterminate equations , we must refer to the memoir itself .
The following symbols may serve as an illustration of the general results : Absolute Relative Name of substance .

Certain apparent exceptions are considered , in which it is not found possible to express the symbols of chemical substances by means of an integral number of prime factors , consistently with the assumption of the modulus a.
