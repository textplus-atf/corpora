On the Evidence of the existence of the Decennial Inequality in the Solar-diurnal Magnetic Variations , and its non-existence in the Lunar-diurnal Variation , of the Declination at Hobarton .
By Major-General EDWARD SABINE , of the Royal Artillery , Treas .
and V.P. of the Royal Society .
Received November 17 , -Read December 18 , 1856 .
IN a report presented to the British Association at Liverpool in September 1854 , entitled " On some of the results obtained at the British Colonial Magnetic Observatories , " I stated that , as far as my examination of the observations had then gone , I had found in the Lunar-diurnal magnetic variation no trace of the decennial period which is so distinctly marked in all the variations connected with the Sun .
And in a subsequent communication to the Royal Society in June 1856 , " On the Lunar-diurnal Variation at Toronto , " in which the moon 's influence on each of the three magnetic elements was examined , the conclusion arrived at was to the same effect , viz. that the observations at Toronto " showed no appearance of the decennial period which constitutes so marked a feature in the solardiurnal variations .
" Since these statements were made , I have read M. KREIL'S memoir " On the Influence of the Moon on the horizontal component of the Magnetic Force , " presented to the Imperial Academy of Sciences at Vienna in 1852 and printed in 1853 , from which I learn ( pp. 45 , 46 ) that M. KREIL is of opinion that the observations of different years at Milan and Prague , when combined , would rather favour the supposition that the same decennial period which exists in the solar variation affects also the lunar magnetic influence .
The question is one of such manifest importance in its theoretical bearing , that I considered it desirable to lose no time in re-examining it by the aid of the Hobarton observations , which , as it appeared to me , were particularly suitable for the purpose , inasmuch as they consist of eight consecutive years of hourly observation ( from January 1841 to December 1848 inclusive ) , made with one and the same set of instruments , and by a uniform system of observation .
The results of this examination have been , as it appears to me , so decidedly confirmatory of the conclusions drawn from the Toronto observations , both as regards the existence of the decennial period in the two classes of solar-diurnal variation ( viz. in the mean diurnal variation occasioned by the disturbances of large amount , and in what may be termed the more regular solardiurnal variation ) , and the non-existence of a similar decennial period in the case of the lunar-diurnal variation , that I have been induced to make these results the subject of a communication to the Royal Society .
The observations at Hobarton comprise , so far as I am aware , the most extensive consecutive series of magnetic observations that have hitherto been made .
The hourly system was adopted there from the first commencement of the Observatory .
We owe it to the zeal and clear-sightedness of Captain ( now Admiral ) Sir JAEs CLARK Ross , by whom the Hobarton Observatory was established , that this improvement upon the two-hourly system proposed by the Royal Society was introduced .
Its superiority for many of the contemplated objects of the Observatories was speedily recognized , and the example followed at the Ordnance Colonial Observatories , by the employment of one additional non-commissioned officer at each , thus enabling the number of daily observations to be doubled at the small extra expense of about ?
24 a-year for each observatory .
The duties of c " Observer , " which at the Ordnance establishments were performed by noncommissioned officers of the Royal Artillery , devolved at Hobarton upon the officers of the Royal Navy who formed the p nel of that Observatory : and I gladly avail myself of this opportunity of placing on record , that to the steady and unremitting zeal of Commander JOSEPHII HENRY KAY during the whole period of eight years , of Lieutenants PEER SCOTT and JOSEPH DAYMAN for the first four years , and of Lieutenants ALEXANDER SMITH and FRANCIS SIMPKINSON during the last four years , are primarily due whatever results may now or hereafter be derived from the Hobarton observations .
The observations of each month , arranged in the same forms as those of the Ordnance establishments , were transmitted by the Admiralty to my office at Woolwich , and have been printed .
For the purpose of this examination they have been treated precisely as those of Toronto , as described in the Philosophical Transactions for 1856 , Art .

The aggregate number of the observations of the Declination at Hobarton which have been passed through those process of reduction is 56,202 ; of these , 4207 were found to differ from the monthly normal at the same hour by an amount which equalled or exceeded four scale-divisions , or 2'84 in arc value , and were accordingly separated from the rest , for the purpose of deducing from them the periodical laws of the class of phenomena to which they belong .
The monthly normals , derived from the great body of the observations after the exclusion of the disturbances of four scale-divisions and upwards , have been employed to show the variation in amount in the different years of the mean diurnal solar influence , forming what is generally understood as the regular solar-diurnal variation ; and the same observations , 51,995 in number , rearranged according to the lunar hours to which they respectively most nearly approximate , have supplied the mean lunar-diurnal variation in the different years treated of in this communication .
* In mentioning the names of the observers , that of Mr. JrIZaY , for several years assistant to Captain KAY , should not be omit &amp; d 2 Disturbansce-variation.-Before , however , we enter on the lunar question , I wish to show the accordance of the two classes of the solar-diurnal phenomena at Hobarton with the decennial period , as it has been inferred from observations in other parts of the globe ; and I shall commence with the disturbance-variation , because it was from this branch of the phenomena that the decennial connexion between the solar-magnetic variations and those of the solar spots was first inferred ; and because , on account of the labour which is required in the investigation , the periodical laws of the disturbances Have hitherto been made out at no other observatories than those of the British Colonies .
I gladly avail myself therefore of the opportunity of showing , that when the disturbances , occurring at Hobarton during eight years , are broken into four distinct and equal portions , each of two years ' duration , each such portion manifests , under a suitable mode of investigation , the same periodical law of diurnal variation , almost identical in the principal features of direction and turning hours , and differing only in the magnitude of the variation in different years , in which difference it conforms strictly to the decennial period as indicated elsewhere , having a minimum in 1843-1844 , and a maximum five years later .
As the existence of a law of diurnal variation regulating the occurrence of the disturbances of large amount rests hitherto , I believe , only on investigations made by myself , I may be excused for here calling attention to the fact , that each of the four portions , into which the disturbances at Hobarton have been divided , bears its testimony to the existence of this law ; -which may be accounted a general one , since it has been found to prevail at stations so widely distant from each other as Toronto , St. Helena , and Hobarton .
The following Table exhibits , for each of the two-yearly periods , the excess at the several hours of mean solar time at the station , of the aggregate easterly differences from the monthly normal at the same hour over the aggregate westerly differences ( or westerly over easterly as the case may be ) , divided by the number of days of observation in each two-yearly period : it is therefore strictly a table of the mean diurnal variation due to the disturbances that have been separated for the purpose of investigating the periodical laws of this class of the phenomena .

The sign + corresponds to Easterly and to Westerly disturbance .
These variations may be represented by the following formulae:1841-1842. .
A==-0-085-0d299sin(a+294-7)+0-178 sin(2a+298'4 ) 1843-1844. .
A , =--0-062-0'231sin(a+294-l)+0-126 sin(2a+319-7 ) 1845--146. .
A , =--0083-0-273sin(a+283-9)+0-107sin(2a+280-2 ) 1847-1848. .
A , =-0-097-0-447sin(a+300-4)+0-227sin(2a+278-6 ) A being the variation at x , the hour required , and a ( corresponding to x ) counted in hours from noon and multiplied by 15 ? .
The curves computed by these formulae are shown to the eye in seconds of arc in Plate I. fig. 1 .
It will at once be seen how thoroughly their inflections accord in character , and at the same time how decidedly and systematically they differ in amount .
The inflections are least in the curve derived from the years 1843-1844 , and greatest in that derived from the years 1847-1848 .
The hour of greatest westerly deflection is about 11 P.M. , and that of greatest easterly deflection about 7 A.M. The difference between the extreme deflections at these hours , or the range of the variation in twenty-four hours in seconds of arc , is given by the formule as follows:1841-1842 .
1843-1844 .
1845-1846 .
1847-1848 .
Easterly extreme ... 120 68 8-8 23'7 Westerly extreme ... .
33-5 24-7 27-5 44-2 Sum ... .
45-5 31-5 36-3 67'9 Taking the differences between the actual results of the observations at the same hours , or the range of the variation in twenty-four hours , from direct observation , we have as follows:1841-1842 .
1843-1844 .
1845-1846 .
1847-1848 .
Easterly extreme ... .
120 5'4 11i2 13'2 Westerly extreme ... 35'4 25-8 27-6 49'2 Sum. .
47'4 31-2 38'8 62'4 Thus it will be seen , that if we estimate the variation in the mean effect of the disturbances , in the course of the decennial period , by the difference in their mean diurnal range respectively in 1843-1844 and 1847-1848 , we should infer that their mean effect is at least twice as great in the year of maximum as in the year of minimum .
It is probable that if either a higher or a lower arbitrary standard than four scaledivisions were taken as constituting a " large disturbance , " the inequality between the years of maximum and minimum might be rendered somewhat greater or somewhat less , but still not materially so ; the result is of too decided a character to doubt the evidence it affords of a subsisting substantial difference between the years of maximum and minimum .
4 Direct Solar-diurnal Variation.-Table II. .

We obtain this result from the eight years in which the observations were made hourly ; but we have also observations in the six following years made with the same instruments at the hours of 2 P.M. and 6 A.M. , and we are thus enabled to trace the decennial inequality through a period of fourteen consecutive years .
In so doing we have to employ throughout ( i. e. in the eight years as in the six years ) the mean positions at 2 P.M. and 6 A.M. only .
The range in the different years is here strictly comparative , but it is not of course the extreme range .

) from the epoch of the moon 's superior culmination .
1841-1842. .
A. =-0-35-3-61sin(a+ 21-8)+ 6-69sin(2a+61-8 ) .
1843-1844 ... A_=+0-51+1-08sin(a+284-4)+10-7 sin(2a+43-6 ) .

1847-1848 ... A=+032+2-7 sin(a+ 55-1)+ 7-7 sin(2a+65-0 ) .
Mean of the eight years A , = +0-25+ 0-98 sin ( a+318-4)+ 8-75 sin ( 2a+45-8 ) .
We may at once perceive , from the relative magnitude of the coefficient of principal significance ( that of sin 2a ) , that the differences in the lunar-diurnal variation corresponding to different years show no conformity to the inequality manifested in those of the solar-diurnal variations .
The curves severally corresponding to these formulae are shown in Plate I. fig. 2 .
for each of the four two-yearly periods .
They exhibit such differences as are to be expected from periods of such limited duration ; but the differences present no appearance whatsoever of a systematic variation corresponding to the decennial inequality of the solardiurnal variations .
There are in each curve four extremes nearly equidistant from each other , two of which are easterly and two westerly extremes : if in each period we take the sum of the extremes , not indeed as an exact measure , but as furnishing an approximate indication of the relative magnitudes of the respective variations , the periods arrange themselves in the following order:'I 1 .
1843-1844 .

1845-1846 .

28-1 If we should prefer as a criterion of the magnitude of the variation , the sum of all the deflections at the different hours in the respective periods , we should have the succession as follows , taking the deflections as calculated by the formulae:1 .
1845-1846 .

1847-1848 .
Sum of deflections. .
123-5 4 .
1841-1842 .
Sum of deflections ... .
117-6 7 In both classes of solar variations the years 1841 , 1846 , 1847 and 1848 are the years of greatest range , and the years 1842 , 1843 , 1844 and 1845 those of least range .
If we unite in one curve the lunar results in the four first-named years , and in a second curve the results in the four last-named years , and compare these two curves , we are so far from finding in the lunar variation an inequality corresponding to that in the solar variation , that the difference between the curves , such as it is , is in fact in the opposite direction .
These curves are drawn in Plate I. fig. 3 , and are there shown in comparison with a third curve , which is that of the mean lunar-diurnal variation in the entire period of eight years .
