On the Great Magnetic Disturbance which extendedfrom August 28 to September 7 , 1859 , as recorded by Photography at the Kew Observatory .
-BYBALFOUR STEWART , A.iM .
Received June 28 , -Read November 21 , 1861 .
DURING the latter part of August , and the beginning of September , 1859 , auroral displays of almost unprecedelted magnificence were observed very widely throughout our globe , accompanied ( as is invariably the case ) with excessive disturbances of the magnetic needle .
The interest attached to these appearances is , if possible , enhanced by the fact , that at the time of their occurrence a very large spot might have been observed on the disc of our luminary-a celestial phenomenon which we have grounds for supposing to be intimately connected with auroral exhibitions and magnetic storms .
The auroral displays above mentioned were very attentively observed throughout Europe , America , and Australia .
In many places these were of the most gorgeous character , while other places were visited by this meteor where its appearance was an event of very rare occurrence .
Even from as low a latitude as Cuba we have a description of it by the Director of the Havannah Observatory , accompanied with the remark that only four previous displays had been recorded in the traditions of the island .
In not a few instances telegraphic communication was interrupted , owing to the current produced in the wires ; and in some cases this proved so powerful that it was used instead of the ordinary current , the batteries being cut off and the wires simply connected with the earth .
It is unnecessary to enter into further particulars regarding this meteor , as the descriptions of it given by observers at places widely apart have been collected together by Professor E. LOOMIS , and published in a series of papers communicated to the American Journal of Science and Arts .
I shall only add that , both from the European , the American , and the Australian accounts , there appear to have been two great displays , each commencing at nearly the same absolute time , throughout the globe , the first on the evening of the 28th of August , and the second on the early morning of the 2nd of September , Greenwich time .
Magnetic disturbances of unusual violence and very wide extent were observed simultaneously with these displays .
These were recorded more or less frequently at the various observatories ; but at Kew there is the advantage of a set of self-recording magnetographs ( the property of the Royal Society ) , which are in constant operation .
As a description of these instruments has already been published in the volume of Reports of the British Association for 1859 , it is only necessary here to mention that they afford the means of obtaining a continuous photographic register of the state of the three elements of the earth 's magnetic force-namely , the declination , and the horizontal and vertical intensity .
Reduced representations of the traces furnished by these instruments during the great disturbance under discussion accompany this paper ; and it will now be necessary to give a short description of these .
In the originals we have for each element , for each day , a straight line and a curved one .
The straight or zero-line serves as a line of abscissae , along which the time is reckoned ; and if from any point of this line denoting a certain time an ordinate be drawn to the corresponding point of the curved line , the length of this ordinate will represent the state of the magnetic element at this time .
The register is taken from 10 A.M. of one day to the same hour of the next , and the curve proceeds ( in point of time ) from the left to the right of the paper .
In full size , the length of the zero-line is about 18 inches for twenty-four hours , so that three-quarters of an inch denote one hour ; but on the reduced scale appended to this paper , threetenths of an inch denote one hour .
The exact Kew mean time corresponding to the commencement and end of each curve is stated at the conclusion of this paper .
Increasing ordinates denote decreasing westerly declination , decreasing horizontal , and decreasing vertical force .
In the reduced scale which accompanies this paper , a change of one inch in the ordinate represents a change of 55 ' in the declination , while for the horizontal force it denotes a change equal to 0237 of the whole , and for the vertical force a change equal to '006 of the whole .
Referring to the curves , it will be seen that the first disturbance commenced about half-past ten on the evening of the 28th of August , affecting all the elements simultaneously .
It will also be observed that for the early part of this day , before the disturbance commenced , the curves present a peculiar serrated appearance .
This is a phenomenon which often precedes and follows large disturbances .
At about 71P.M .
, August 29 , the violence of the disturbance had somewhat abated , and things remained nearly in this state until 5 A.M. , September 2 , about which time another very abrupt disturbance simultaneously affected all the elements , continuing with great violence until about 4 P.M. of the same day , when it became somewhat less .
The elements , notwithstanding , remained in a state of considerable disturbance until September 5 , and scarcely attained their normal state even on September 7 or 8 .
A graphical representation of the amount of disturbance is furnished by the dotted line , or line of normals , which accompanies each curve .
These normals have been furnished through the kindness of General SABINE , by whom they were calculated .
They denote the probable position which the curve corresponding to each element would have occupied , had not disturbance supervened .
The normal for the declination for any hour is a mean of the daily observations at that hour during August and September , after the omission of all disturbed observations which differ from the final normal by an amount equal to or exceeding 31.3 .
The normals for the horizontal and vertical force have been obtained in a somewhat 424 ' similar manner , the separating values ( corresponding to 3 ' 3 for the declination ) being for the horizontal force '0014 of its whole amount , and for the vertical force '000478 of the whole .
I now proceed to notice some of the peculiarities of this magnetic storm .
It appears that we have two distinct well-marked disturbances , each commencing abruptly and ending gradually , the first of which began on the evening of August 28 , and the second on the early morning of September 2 .
These two great disturbances correspond therefore in point of time to the two great auroral displays already alluded to , The average effect of the disturbance of August 28 was to increase the declination , and to diminish the horizontal and vertical components of the earth 's magnetic force .
The appearance of the curves indicates very well the modzus operandi of the disturbing force on this occasion .
From their serrated appearance , it will be seen that a force tending to increase one of the elements was generally followed after a short interval by one of the opposite description , and vice versa .
The exertion of the disturbing force was thus of a throbbing or pulsatory character .
The interval of time between two of these minute pulsations may be said to have varied from half a minute , or the smallest observable portion of time , up to four or five minutes .
This pulsatory character of the disturbing force agrees well with the nature of its action on telegraphic wires , in which observers have noticed that the polarity of the current changes very frequently .
Apart from these comparatively rapid and minute changes , the curves referring to this great disturbance indicate , for all the elements , pulsations in the disturbing force which have a period of from forty to fifty minutes .
These pulsations are of a very violent character in the case of the declination , where the ebb and flow of the force alternately carries the needle above and below its normal.position .
We have thus , as it were , two sets of waves , the first or smaller of which is superimposed upon the second or larger , just as in the ocean we sometimes see ripples caused by the wind traversing the surface of a great wave .
But in addition to these there is a still more remarkable period which this great disturbance seems to have accomplished for all the elements in about six hours from its commencement , after which it started anew in the same direction as at first , to accomplish another period or grand wave , which lasted about the same time .
The violence of the disturbance seems to have exhausted itself in the accomplishment of these two grand waves ; for after this , although the needle was far from tranquil , yet its evagations were of a more moderate description .
Three periods are thus observable,1 .
That extending from half a minute up to four or five minutes .
2 .
A period of from forty to fifty minutes .
3 .
A period of about six hours .
It is impossible to state with accuracy what were the greatest departures from the mean values caused by this disturbance , as the curves for all the elements went beyond the sensitive paper ; very approximately , however , we may estimate these as follows:3 2 425 For the declination a departure of about. .
+20 20 ' For the horizontal force. .
--04 of the whole .
For the vertical force ... 01 of the whole .
The second great disturbance commenced very abruptly on September 2 , at 5 A.M. In character it was similar to that of August 28 , its mean tendency being to increase the declination , and to diminish the horizontal and vertical components of the earth 's magnetic force .
It is impossible to state the greatest departures from the mean caused by this disturbance ; but in all probability they equalled or even exceeded those of the first .
In appearance , also , the second disturbance was similar to the first , and it lost its excessive character for all the elements simultaneously about 3h 40 " P.M. of the 2nd of September ; but , as has been already mentioned , and as may be seen from the lines of normals , it did not finally subside until September 7 .
After it had somewhat abated , its nature was exhibited by that peculiar serrated appearance of the curves which has already been alluded to , and which is very prominent in those of September 3rd and 4th .
This appearance , however , had ceased some time before the elements finally resumed their normal values .
Such is a brief and very imperfect description of the leading features of this great magnetic storm , which for excessive violence of character and length of duration , I have been assured by General SABINE , has never been surpassed by any similar phenomenon which has occurred in his long and varied experience .
But , besides these two remarkable disturbances into which it divides itself , this great storm comprehends a minor disturbance , not approaching these two in extent , but yet possessing an interest peculiar to itself , which entitles it to be mentioned .
On September 1 , a little before noon , Mr. R. C. CARRINGTON happened to be observing , by means of a telescope , a large spot which might then be seen on the surface of our luminary , when a remarkable appearance presented itself , which he thus describes in a communication to the Royal Astronomical Society .
" W7Vhile engaged in the forenoon of Thursday , September 1 , 1859 , in taking my customary observation of the forms and positions of the solar spots , an appearance was witnessed which I believe to be exceedingly rare .
The image of the sun 's disc was , as usual with me , projected on to a plate of glass coated with distemper of a pale straw colour , and at a distance and under a power which presented a picture of about 11 inches diameter .
I had secured diagrams of all the groups and detached spots , and was engaged at the time in counting from a chronometer and recording the contacts of the spots with the cross-wires used in the observation , when within the area of the great north group ( the size of which had previously excited general remark ) , two patches of intensely bright and white light broke out , in the positions indicated in the appended diagram by the letters A and B , and of the forms of the spaces left white .
My first impression was , that by some chance a ray of light had penetrated a hole in the screen 426 attached to the object-glass , by which the general image is thrown into shade , for the brilliancy was fully equal to that of direct sunlight ; but , by at once interrupting the current observation , and causing the image to move by turning the RTA .
handle , I saw I was an unprepared witness of a very different affair .
I thereupon noted down the time by the chronometer , and , seeing the outburst to be very rapidly on the increase , and being somewhat flurried by the surprise , I hastily ran to call some one to witness the exhibition with me , and on returning within 60 seconds , was mortified to find that it was already much changed and enfeebled .
Very shortly afterwards the last trace was gone ; and although I maintained a strict watch for nearly an hour , no recurrence took place .
The last traces were at C and D , the patches having travelled considerably from their first position , and vanishing as two rapidly fading dots of white light .
The instant of the first outburst was not 15 seconds different from Ilh 18m Greenwich mean time , and 11h 23 " was taken for the time of disappearance .
In this lapse of five minutes , the two patches of light traversed a space of about 35,000 miles , as may be seen by the diagram , which is given exactly on a scale of 12 inches to the sun 's diameter .
On this scale the section of the earth will be very nearly equal in area to that of the detached spot situated most to the north in the diagram , and the section of Jupiter would about cover the area of the larger group , without including the outlying portions .
It was impossible , on first witnessing an appearance so similar to a sudden conflagration , not to expect a considerable result in the way of alteration of the details of the group in which it occurred ; and I was certainly surprised , on referring to the sketch which I had carefully and satisfactorily ( and I may add fortunately ) finished before the occurrence , at finding myself unable to recognize any change whatever as having taken place .
The impression left upon me is , that the phenomenon took place at an elevation considerably above the general surface of the sun , and , accordingly , altogether above and over the great group in which it was seen projected .
Both in figure and position the patches of light seemed entirely independent of the configuration of the great spot , and of its parts , whthter nucleus or umbra .
The customary observation was shortly resumed ; and the diagram engraved , 427 as well as the larger drawing exhibited at the Meeting on November 11 , was deduced from an exact reduction of the recorded times .
" It has been very gratifying to me to learn that our friend Mr. HODGSON chanced to be observing the sun at his house at Holloway on the same day , and to hear that he was a witness of what he also considered a very remarkable phenomenon .
I have carefully avoided exchanging any information with that gentleman , that any value which the accounts may possess may be increased by their entire independence .
" On calling at Kew Observatory a day or two afterwards , Mr. CARRINGTON learned that at the very moment when he had observed this phenomenon the three magnetic elements at Kew were simultaneously disturbed .
If no connexion had been known to subsist between these two classes of phenomena , it would , perhaps , be wrong to consider this in any other light than a casual coincidence ; but since General SABINE has proved that a relation subsists between magnetic disturbances and sun spots , it is not impossible to suppose that in this case our luminary was taken in the act .
This disturbance occurred as nearly as possible at 11 " 15m A.M. Greenwich mean time , on September 1 , 1859 , affecting all the elements simultaneously , and commencing quite abruptly .
The first or most abrupt portion of the disturbance lasted only about three minutes for all the elements ; but after that there was a more gradual change in the same direction before the curve turned .
This more gradual continuation of the first sudden movement lasted about seven minutes for all the elements .
The westerly declination was increasedBy the first , or three-minute movement , about. .
66 By the last , or seven-minute movement , about. .
6'6 In all , the disturbance increased the westerly ) 13 2 declination ... ... .
The horizontal force was diminishedBy the first movement ... '005 of the whole .

In all , it was diminished by -0075 of the whole force .
The vertical force was also diminishedBy the first movement ... .
0008 of the whole .
By the last movement ... .
0005 of the whole .
In all , it was diminished by '0013 of the whole force .
It thus appears that the direction of this disturbance was the same for all the elements as that of the two great disturbances , the latter of which took place not many hours afterwards .
The leading features of this great storm appear to suggest something regarding the 428 nature of that relationship which manifestly exists between auroral displays , earthcurrents , and magnetic disturbances .
I cannot think that the latter are caused directly and mainly by the two former , but rather that the three are simultaneous effects produced by the same cause .
I believe that this is the opinion entertained by General SABINE , who has investigated the subject from another point of view .
A very remarkable feature of this disturbance was its period of about six hours , which is most distinctly shown in the curves of the horizontal and vertical forces .
For about three hours the two components of the earth 's force at Kew were diminishing , and for the next three hours these were increasing , until , after the lapse of about six hours , they had again attained their normal values .
Were this due to the direct action of an electric current , it would require that this current should have flowed in the same direction for six hours ; or at least that it should have been so limited in direction as to influence the earth 's magnetism at Kew in the same manner for about six hours .
Referring now to the accounts collected by Professor LOOMIS of the influence of this great storm upon telegraphic wires , and also to a paper on magnetic storms and earthcurrents , communicated by Mr. C. V. WALKER to the Royal Society on January 31 , 1861 , we find that the duration of the currents produced in the telegraphic wires is for the most part exceedingly small .
The 1-minute currents ( says this last author ) are most in number ; then , in order , the 2-minute , 3-minute , 4-minute , 1-minute , and 5-minute .
Now it seems impossible that any combination of such currents of short period and rapid reversal can account for the six hours ' march of the earth 's force at Kew , and equally impossible not to associate these currents of small period with the rapid and minute changes which give a pulsatory character to the disturbing force , and a serrated appearance to the curves .
It is not difficult to conceive a mode of action of the primary force which would produce these effects .
We have grounds for supposing this primary disturbing force to reside in our luminary .
The earth may be viewed as the iron core of a RUHMKORFF'S machine , separated by an insulating medium ( that is to say , the lower strata of the atmosphere ) from a conducting medium ( that is to say , the upper and rarer strata of the atmosphere ) .
Suppose the primary current in the sun suddenly to become increased or diminished a little .
This will not produce a reversal in the magnetic state which this current has communicated to the earth , but merely a small change in its amount ; or , in other words , the magnetic disturbance produced by the current will merely be somewhat increased or diminished .
The change in the primary current , heightened by the change of the iron core , will , on the other hand , produce a secondary current : 1st .
Along the surface of the earth , which is sufficiently conducting for the purpose ; 2nd .
Along the upper strata of the atmosphere ; 429 and this discharge will be in one direction for an increase , and in the opposite direction for a diminution of the primary current .
Disturbances would thus seem to be due to the absolute amount of the primary current , and auroras and earth-currents to the rapidity with which this current changes .
Let me remark , in conclusion , that if it be true that the spots on the surface of our luminary ( or action connected with these spots ) are the primary cause of magnetic disturbances , it is to be hoped , since the study of the sun 's disc is at present a favourite subject with observers , that ere long something more definite may be known with regard to the exact relation that subsists between these two great phenomena .
