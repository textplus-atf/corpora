Observations on the changes the egg undergoes during incubation in the common fowl , illustrated by microscopical drawings .
By Sir EVERARD HOME , Bart. V. P. R. S. Read May 16 , 18ae .
H is has been a favourite subject with many of the most celebrated anatomists .
The great HARVEY , MALPIGHI , and JOHN HUNTER , have done more than any others in the advancement of this enquiry .
HUNTER'S observations were never rendered so complete as to induce him to publish them ; but what he has done is open to the public , both in the preparations in his Collection , and in his Cabinet of Drawings .
In these last , the vesicle which begins near the rectum , and afterwards envelopes the embryo , is clearly made out , In the year 1815 , Mr. DUTROCHET , an ingenious French anatomist , laid a Memoir upon this subject before the French Academy .
Mr. G. CUVIER has given a Report upon this Memoir , but has not given the Memoir itself .
He considers the author to be the first person who has clearly explained the rise and progress of the vesicle but some of Mr. HUNTER'S drawings of it are dated 1773 , the year I went to live in his house .
After all that has been done , much is still wanting to render the investigation complete ; and to promote this object , the following Observations and Drawings are brought before the Society .
The gelatinous molecule , from which the future embryo s S39 3 is to be formed , is originally placed on the surface of the yelk ; it is found there before the yelk leaves the ovarium , and lies loose upon it , not being enveloped in any capsule .
The external membrane of the yelk is very thin and delicate , its surface is studded over with red dots , which disappear in its passage along the oviduct .
When this is removed , there is a second thick and spongy covering under it , in which there is a natural aperture ; and the areola , surrounding the molecule , is nothing more than the surface of the yelk , that is circumscribed by the margin of this aperture .
No such aperture has been before taken notice of .
The molecule itself has a granulated appearance ; in the centre it is made up of globules 8oo part of an inch in diameter , surrounded by circles of a mixed substance , consisting of about two-thirds of the same small globules , and one-third of larger oval globules , about : I ?
part of an inch in length , and 2--opart in diameter ; these last , in their figure , resemble the red globules of the blood in the bird in every respect , excepting their red colour .
Besides the globules there is some fine oil , which appears in drops when the parts are immersed in water .
Oval globules and oil are also met with in the yelk itself , but in small proportion , and without colour .
All these parts , except the red dots on the surface , are met with in the yelk on a smaller scale , even six days before it is completely formed .
The ovarial yelk-bag gives way at the middle line , farthest from the insertion of the blood-vessels , and the yelk drops out into the mouth of the oviduct .
The yelk-bag does not immediately close , although it contracts considerably : some time after it is nearly obliterated ; and on the pedicle , the rudiments of a new yelk are formed .
The yelk-bags are exceedingly vascular ; the outer membrane of the yelks is connected to them by vessels and fasciculi of fibres , but easily separated .
The yelk , while in the ovarium , has an oval form , and lies with its long axis towards the pedicle of the bag .
See Plate XXXII .
figures i , , 3 , 4 , 5 .
In its passage along the oviduct the yelk acquires the albumen , and before it comes to the lower end , the albumen is covered by a very fine membrane .
In this passage the thread-like substances , called by Mr. HUNTER the poles , by others the chalazes , are formed ; and terminate in the double membrane , which is added at the time the egg has reached the enlargement at the lower end of the oviduct .
In the cloacus the shell is formed .
If the egg is taken out before it has acquired a shell , it remains soft for several days ; in one instance , after four days , it was so semitransparent as to receive a yellow tint from the yelk .
On puncturing the covering , the contents rushed out , but immediately resumed their form , being enclosed in the thin membrane of the albumen .
The molecule with its areola , and the chalazes , were distinctly seen .
The whole contents had less volume than the shell , particularly in the long axis , being truncate at both extremities .
When immersed for an hour and half in distilled vinegar , the albumen and other parts had become somewhat coagulated .
Plate XXXII .
fig. 6 , 7,8,9 .
In the new laid egg the appearances are exactly the same , 341 whether it is impregnated or not .
Plate XXXII .
fig. io , 11 , 12 .
When the shell and membranes under it are removed from one side , the yelk appears to be kept in its place by the poles , although allowed to rotate upon its axis .
The gelatinous molecule , with its areola , is always found upon the highest point of the upper surface of the yelk .
Whether this arises from the molecule , or from the areola being the lightest part of the yelk , has not been ascertained .
When the hen begins to sit , a new laid egg , which has not been allowed to cool , will have the rudiments of the embryo formed some hours sooner than in the other eggs .
Having traced the formation of the egg itself through all the changes that take place from the time the yelk leaves the ovarium till it is impregnated , we are now to follow those changes that are met with during incubation till the em , bryo becomes a completely formed chicken .
In 4 hours after incubation the outer edge of the areola had become enlarged , and that part of it next the molecule appeared darker .
One end of the molecule appeared like a white line , the first rudiments of the embryo .
Plate XXXIII .
fig. 1 , , 2 .
In 8 hours , the white line was found to be extended , and the rudiments of a brain and spinal marrow were formed , surrounded by a membrane , which afterwards becomes amnion .
The areola had extended itself , and the surface beyond the line which formed its boundary had acquired the consistence of a membrane , and had also a distinct line by which it was circumscribed .
This I shall call the outer areola .
In the space between these two areolas , there were distinct dots of an oily matter .
This extension of membrane to the outer areola lies under the inner membrane of the yelk , and can readily be removed entire .
Plate XXXIII .
fig. 4 , 5 , 6 .
In 12 hours , the rudiments of the brain were more distinct , as well as of the spinal marrow .
These parts were placed upon a black ground in vinegar , and hardened ; the upper end showed the tuberculum annulare of the brain , from which passed down two semi-transparent lines resembling an appearance peculiar to the spinal marrow of the bird .
Plate XXXIII .
fig. 7 , 8 , 9 .
In 16 hours , there was a farther advance in the structure of all these parts .
Plate XXXIV .
fig. 1 , 2 , 3 .
In e4 hours , a still greater itlcrease .
Plate XXXIV .
fig. 4 , 5 6 .
In 36 hours , the head was turned to the left side .
The cerebrum and cerebellum appeared to be distinct bodies ; the iris was seen through the pupil of the eye .
The intervertebral nerves were nearly completely formed ; those nearest the head the most distinct .
A portion of the heart was seen .
At this period , under the inner areola , apparently at the termination of the spinal marrow , a vesicle had begun to protrude .
In some eggs it is seen earlier than in others , and has been observed before the heart had become visible .
Plate XXXIV .
fig. 7 , 8 , 9 .
In 2 days 12 hours , the spinal marrow was found to have its posterior part enclosed ; the auricles and ventricles of the heart were seen , the auricles filled with red blood .
An arterial trunk from the left ventricle gave off ' two large 343 vessels , one to the right side of the abdomen of the embryo , the other to the left , sending branches over the whole of the areolar membrane , which was bounded on each side by a large trunk carrying red blood ; but the two trunks did not unite , there being a small space on one side rendering the circle incomplete .
The vesicle was somewhat increased in size ; it lay in the lower part of the abdomen , the parietes of which were not yet formed .
Plate XXXV .
fig. , 2 , 3 .
In 3 days , the outer areola had extended itself over j of the circumference of the yelk , carrying the marginal arteries along with it to the outer edge , but diminished in size .
The brain was much enlarged , consisting of four cavities containing a fluid , the cerebellum still the largest .
The spinal marrow and its nerves were more perfectly formed .
The eye appeared only to want the nigrum pigmentum .
The right ventricle of the heart contained red blood : the arteries could be traced to the head : the rudiments of the wings and legs were formed : the vesicle was farther enlarged , but its vessels did not carry red blood .
It had forced its way out through the external covering of the yelk , and opened a communication through this slit , by which a part of the albumen was admitted to mix itself with the yelk , and give it a more oval form , At this period the embryo is generally found to have changed its position , and to be wholly turned on the left side .
Plate XXXV .
fig. , 5 , 6 .
In 4 days , the vesicle was more enlarged and more vascular , its vessels containing red blood .
The optic nerve and nigrum pigmentum of the eye were visible ; the other parts had become more perfectly formed , The outer areola had extended itself half over the yelk , which had now become still more increased in size , a greater portion of albumen having become mixed with it .
Plate XXXV .
fig. 7 , 8 , 9 .
In 5 days , the membranous bag that formed the vesicle had acquired a great size , and become exceedingly vascular in its coats ; the cavity contained a fluid .
The yelk had become thinner in its consistence , more of the albumen having been mixed with it .
Plate XXXVI .
fig. i , , , 3 .
In 6 days , the vascular membrane of the areola had extended farther over the yelk .
The .
vesicle at this time had suddenly expanded itself in form of a double night-cap over the yelk and its coverings , beginning to enclose the embryo .
This change is so rapid , that it has been with difficulty detected , and different accounts have been given of the mode in which it takes place .
The amnion contained water , in which the embryo floated , suspended by the vessels supplying the areolar and vesicular membrane .
The brain had become enlarged to the size of the body of the embryo : its vessels were distinctly seem The two eyes equalled in size the whole brain : the marsupium was seen covered with nigrum pigmentum .
The vessels of the cerebellum could be traced into the convolutions of the pia matter .
The parietes of the thorax and abdomen had begun to form ; the wings and legs were nearly completely formed , as well as the bill .
At this period muscular action was first noticed .
Plate XXXVI .
fig. 4 , 5 , 6 .
In 7 days , the vesicle having extended over the embryo , had begun to enclose the areolar covering of the yelk , and a pulsation was distinctly seen in the trunk that supplied the vesicular bag with blood .
The pulsations were 79 in a minute while the embryo was kept in the temperature of 105 ?
, but when the temperature was diminished the pulsation ceased , and when restored was reproduced .
The pulsation was kept up , by attention being paid to the temperature , for 36 hours .
Muscular action had become vigorous in the limbs .
When the embryo was completely immersed , although the temperature of the water was io8 ?
, the pulsations immediatelyceased , the blood being no longer aerated .
Plate XXXVI .
fig. 7 , 8 , 9 .
In 8 days , the anastomosing branches of the vesicular circulation had the arterial pulsation very strong in them , Plate XXXVII .
fig. 1 , , 3 .
In 9 days , the vesicle had nearly enclosed the yelk , but not entirely ; for when the embryo was turned upon its back , and the opposite surface examined , a portion of yelk was unenclosed , and beyond it some of the albumen was met with not mixed with the yelk .
Plate XXXVII .
fig. 4 , 5 , 6 .
In io days , the vesicle was opened , and the upper half turned aside .
When the amnion , which had becoime full of water , was opened and the embryo taken out , the thorax was found completely enclosed ; the roots of the feathers were distinct , and the passage for the areolar as well as the vesicular vessels exposed .
In 14 days , the yelk remained out of the body .
When the thorax and abdomen were opened , and the heart as well as the lobes of the liver turned aside , the trunks of the bloodvessels could be traced to the heart ; but as the arteries immediately after death become empty and the veins remain full , the vein from the vesicle , and that from the areola were the most conspicuous .
In 18 days , the greater part of the yelk was drawn into the body .
In 20 days , the chick was completely formed ; the yelk was entirely drawn in , and only some portions of the membrane of the vesicle appeared externally .
The yelk passed into the intestine a little way above the openings of the coeca .
Having traced the progress of the formation of the chick step by step , from the first appearance of the molecule found on the yelk before it leaves the ovarium to the complete evolution of all its parts , and its leaving the shell , I shall now take advantage of this investigation , which , illustrated as it is by Mr. BAUER'S microscopical drawings , will stand long without a parallel .
Although the processes by which the human foetus and that of quadrupeds are formed , differ in many essential particulars from those employed in the bird , some circumstances are common to both ; one of these , the mode in which the vesicle bursts the membranes of the yelk is distinctly seen in the embryo in the egg hatched out of the body , and explains what takes place where the embryo is attached to the uterus , which otherwise could not have been ascertained .
In a former paper , I have shown the formation of the ovum in the corpus luteum ; I have traced this ovum into the uterus , where it became concealed in the soft flocculent bed of efflorescent coagulable lymph prepared to receive it .
That it is afterwards enveloped in this moss-like covering , has been demonstrated by my revered master in Human Anatomy , Dr. WILLIAM HUNTER ; but in what manner the embryo breaks its amnion , and opens a communication with the uterus , is a question on which Dr. HUNTER is sile n't : indeed it is one that could not be touched upon till it was ascertained that the ovum , when it arrived at the uterus , was completely enclosed in the amnion .
Having been the first to ascertain that curious fact , and having arrived at that knowledge through the microscopical observations of Mr. BAUER , I am peculiarly gratified , that the same powers , exerted in another correspondent investigation , should have enabled me to give the solution .
In the ovum of the hen , the rudiments of the embryo require nourishment from one source , aeration from another , In the human ovum one source supplies both ; but in either case there is a necessity for a communication between the blood vessels of the embryo and the source of their blood 's aeration ; and this is effected in exactly the same manner in the human species , the quadruped , and the bird .
Out of this the embryo acquires a mode of suspension in the amnion which secures it from injury , both in the bird and quadruped .
The mode is as follows : that bag , which is afterwards in the human species and in quadrupeds to become the urinary bladder , is enlarged to a certain size with such rapidity , that it bursts the amnion , which is prepared to be so ruptured , and the arteries lying upon its two sides are carried directly into contact with the chorion , and there the placenta is formed in the open space between the two edges of the chorion .
This is exactly similar to the vesicle in the chick bursting the covering of the yelk , and forming the enveloping bag .
It is deserving of remark , that in the human ovum , and that of quadrupeds , there is a natural opening in the external membrane ; in the bird , the natural opening is in the internal one , which in its structure bears a resemblance to the chorion .
