V. " A Preliminary Investigation into the Laws regulating the Peaks and Hollows exhibited in the Kew Magnetic Curves for the first two years of their production .
" By BALFOURt STEWART , LIID .
, F.R.S. , Superintendent of the Kew Observatory .
Received May 20 , 1869 .
The Kew magnetographs began to be in regular operation in May 1858 , and have continued so up to the present date .
The curves derived from these instruments , representing the changes which take place in the three components of the earth 's magnietismn at Kew , are often found to be studded with siall serrated appearances , which have been denominated peaks and hollows ; and the following remarks will serve to show that the study of these may be attended with considerable advantage .
The labours of General Sabine have been instrumental in showing that there are at least two forces concerned in producing disturbances ; and this conclusion is confirmed by the appearance of the Kew curves , from which it may be seen that no disturbanice of any magnitude is due to the action of a single force merely varying in amount and not in direction ; for if this were the case the distance at any moment of a point in the curve of one of the elements from its normal position should bear throughout such a disturbance an invariable proportion to the distance of a corresponding point in the curve of another of the elements from its normal ; but this is by no means the case .
It becomes therefore a question of interest to endeavour to find the elementary forces concerned in producing a disturbance ; and it is thought that this knowledge may to some extent be attained by a study of those small and rapid changes of force which are denoted by peaks and hollows .
For if several independent forces are at work , it may be thought unlikely that at the same moment a sudden change should take place in all ; there is thus a probability that sudden changes of force , as exhibited in peaks and hollows , are changes in one of the elementary forces concerned , which may thus enable us to determine the nature of that force .
Even if the change is not a very abrupt one , provided that we confine ourselves to such peaks and hollows as present a similar appearance for all the curves , we may suppose that we are observing changes in orne only of the elementary distuirbing forces ; for it is unlikely that two or more independent forces , changing independently , should produce similar appearances in all of the three curves .
Thus what we have to look for is similar appearances ; and the precise meaningo , attached to this expression will be rendered clear / eln\AI bymeans of the annexed graphical representation .
DeclinationWe see here that ( time being reckoned horizontally ) we have a disturbance commencing at the Eor , force .
same moment in each of the three elements , that II for the declination being throughout three times as Vert. force , large , and that for the annexed force twice as large as the corresponding vertical-force distuirbance .
In a paper communicated by me to the Royal Society , and published in the Transactions ( 1862 , page 621 ) , it was stated that , as a rule , small and abrupt disturbances at Kew tend either to increase at the same moment both components of magnetic force and the westerly declination , or to decrease these elements , as the case may be .
As in the Kew curves of 1862 , increasing ordinates represented decreasing horizontal force , decreasing vertical force , and decreasing decliniation , the above statement is the asme as saying that , as a rule , peaks and hollows in one element correspond to peaks and hollows in the other two .
Nevertheless one notable exception to this rule was mentioned in the above paper , namely , that at the beginning of the great disturbance of August-September 1859 , an abrupt fall of the declination curve corresponded to a rise of the other two components .
It was also shown in this paper that while the horizontal-force peaks are always as nearly as possible double in size of the vertical-force peaks , the proportion between the declination peaks and those of the other components appeared to be variable .
Some light was thrown upon this variability in a subsequent paper by Senhor Capello and myself , in which the peaks and hollows at Lisbon and at Kew were compared together ( Proc. Roy .
Soc. 1864 , p. 11 1)o It was found that these phenomenia occurred simultaneously at these two observatories ; and it was stated that , as far as Kew is concerned , the proportion of the declination peaks and hollows to those of the horizontal and vertical force presents the appearance of a daily range , being great at the early morning hours and small in those of the afternoon .
Thus the type of small and abrupt changes , judging from the behaviour of the declination , seemed to vary from two causes , being in the first place subject to a diurnal variation , and in the second place appearing to vary with the disturbance , inasmuch as that for the great disturbance AugustSeptember 1859 was , as above stated , entirely different from the usual type .
This complexity seems puzzling ; but the results of a preliminary comparison between the Stonyhurst and Kew declination magnetographs ( Sidgreaves and Stewart , Proc. Roy .
Soc. 1869 , p. 236 ) appear to throw some light upon its cause .
It was there stated that when the declinationcurves of Stonyhurst and Kew are compared together during rather slow disturbances , the scales are such that the traces seem exactly to coincide even to their most minute features ; but , on the other hand , when the disturbance is abrupt , there is an excess of Stonyhurst over Kew , which appears to vary with the abruptness of the disturbance , being great when this is great .
In fine , there appears to be superimposed upon a disturbance , which is mainly cosmical , a comparatively small effect , which appears to be of a more local nature , and may perhaps be caused by earth-currents .
This circumstance renders it prudeint , in discussing the laws of the small and abrupt changes of force ( peaks and hollows ) at Kew , to avoid all great and excessively abrupt disturbances , confining ourselves to those cases in which there is only a moderate abruptness .
The result obtained for the great disturbance August-September 1859 may therefore be dismissed as probably effected by this local cause , iniasmuch as the disturbance measured was very abrupt .
The question then arises-Rejecting very great and abrupt disturbances , has the peak-and-hollow force only a regular diurnal variation , or is it subject besides to other chaniges of type ?
Mr. Whipple , magnetical assistant at IKew , has carefully selected and measured all the sinmiilar peaks and hollows for the first two years of the few curves ; and the result exhibits a manifest diuriral variation in the type of the peal-and-hollow force .
In the following , Table we have these various measurements ranged in order of date , the unit of the scale adopted being of an inch .

Bearing in mind the difficulty of finding exactly similar appearances denoting an unmixed force , and remembering also the small size of many of the peaks and hollows observed , it is not too much to say that , as far as these two years ' observations are concerned , there is no trace of anything else than a diurnal change in the type of the peak-and-hollow force .
But this question cannot be finally decided until more observations are discussed .
In the following Table the final results of Table II .
are brought before the eye in a conidensed form .

It will also be seen that there is a very marked diurnal range in the ratio which the declination peak or hollow bears to that of the vertical force , this ratio being greatest about 7 A.M. About this hour we have also most peaks and hollows , while in the evening and very early morning hours there is a comparative absence of these phenomena .
So much is this the case that for the two years inivestigated I have not succeeded in finding a single example of a peak or hollow , suitable for this research , between the hours of 6 and 7 P.M. , or between those of 9 and 10 P.M. I forbear to make further remarks on this subject , but hope in a short time to extend the investigation up to the present date , and to bring the results before this Society .
