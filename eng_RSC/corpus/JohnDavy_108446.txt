On the Temperature of Man within the Tropics .
By JOHN DAVY , M.D. , F.R.S. , L. 8f E. , Inspector-General of Army Hospitals .
Received February 26 , -Read May 2 , 1850 .
IN a paper on the Temperature of Man , which I had the honour to submit to the Royal Society in 1845 , and which was published in the Philosophical Transactions for the same year , I expressed the hope of being able to continue the inquiry in the West Indies , to which I was then about to proceed .
In the present communication I propose to lay before the Society the results of the trials made whilst there , viz. during a period of about three years and a half , exclusive of trifling interruptions , and of one prolonged through several weeks , between June 1847 and October of that year , owing to illness .
In making the trials , the same instrument as that before used was employed , and with like precautions to ensure accuracy , and as then , the subject of the observations was the same individual ; also , as then , the pulse and respirations were noticed at the time , and invariably in the sitting posture .
The greater numbet of the observations were made in Barbados , in a house situated about half a mile from the sea-shore and a few feet only above its level , -where the mean annual temperature of the atmosphere is about 80 ?
FAHR. , and the range of temperature throughout the year from about 10 ?
to 18 ?
in the open air .
For the sake of comparison , I shall follow as closely as possible the order observed in my former paper in stating the results .
1 .
Of the Variation of Temperature during the twenty-four hours .
To ascertain this , observations were made commonly thr ee times a day , viz. immediately on rising , about 6 A.M. , before taking any food , and before making any exertion , even in dressing , clad merely in a light dress consisting of loose drawers and gown , which in that climate are almost always sufficient for comfort ; -next , about 2 P.M. , sometimes an hour earlier or later , and generally after occupation , either within doors at home , or at an office a mile and a half distant nearly , to which I went in a carriage , the occupation being chiefly that of reading or writing , or some other requiring little bodily exertion ; -next , the last thing before retiring to rest at night , which was commonly at 10 o'clock , rarely later than 11 .
It may be further premised , that the manner of living , as to diet and the time of meals , was much the same as in England , -breakfasting commonly at 9 o'clock , dining about 5 , without intermediate luncheon , and drinking tea about 7 .
The following Table exhibits the observations made in accordance with the above , The observations from which these mean results are deduced are so consistent , as may be seen by reference to them in detail in the Appendix , as hardly to admit of doubt in relation to their accuracy .
Probably the low morning temperature of the body within the tropics , as shown above , may be owing principally to three circumstances , to the depressing or lowering power of sleep , to the light bed-covering used there , and the free circulation of the air in the room .
A sheet and a thin coverlet were the only protection from the air ; and the windows mostly being open , the outer air had free access , so that towards morning the temperature of the air of the room did not differ from that of the external air commonly more than two or three degrees .
Moreover , the higher temperature observed at night , before going to rest , may have conduced to the lower morning temperature noticed on rising , as the lower temperature at night in England , with the opposite circumstances as to bed-clothing and air of sleeping-room , may have conduced to the higher morning temperature recorded there , -fluctuations these in accordance with well-known physiological laws .

Of the Effect of Active Exercise on the lemperature and of Rest after Exercise .
On most occasions , when active exercise was taken , especially when on military duty , the dress worn was heavier and warmer than that in common use , to which partly the increase of temperature observed may be justly applies to the majority of the following observations:referred .

Those given , which were chiefly at night , were best marked , no doubt owing to the temperature of the air then being lower than by day , and the heat from the reflected and direct rays of the sun being then entirely avoided .
When coming from the higher grounds of the interior of Barbados at night , and often when ascending them by day , the feeling of coolness was such as to render agreeable some additional clothing , which was always provided , though the difference of atmospheric temperature was only of a very few degrees .
The latter observations , those of the 18th of November 1846 and of the 18th of December , are given as showing the tendency to augmentation of temperature of body in an undue degree after unusual depression , preceded by fatiguing exercise .
The rise , so far as it was abnormal , was probably owing to the influence of the fatigue , for it was not witnessed if such exercise had not been taken .
5 .
Of the Effect of Gentle Falking Exercise on the Temperature .
The following observations were made when convalescing from illness ( an anthrax with extensive sloughing and general derangement of health ) , a time when the body in a delicate state seems to be very readily acted on and to show the effects with unusual distinctness : Tongue .

higher than at the first .
The feeling of increased warmth in the hands and feet from gentle exercise has been noticed in three instances .
The diffusion of heat to the extremities , owing no doubt to a freer circulation of the warming medium the blood-may partly account for the cooling effect under the tongue , and probably in the deep-seated parts from the exercise under consideration .
The high temperature commonly observed in the extremities within the tropics , is a circumstance very deserving of note .
In the daily observations appended , a record is given of the temperature of the hand during two months , noticed three times a day ; from which it appears that on an average it was less than that under the tongue by only 1 ? .
For the purpose of ascertaining the heat of the hand , the bulb of the thermometer was placed between the middle of the palm and the ball of the thumb , and so covered was gently pressed .
6 .
Of the Effect of Change of the Temperature of the Atmosphere on the T'emperature .
In illustration of this effect , I shall notice only a very few of the observations obtained in the West Indies , corroborative of those collected many years ago in the island of Ceylon .
The situation of Villa Nova has already been mentioned : it was there that most of them were made , that spot being well-fitted for trials of the kind , the temperature there by day rarely exceeding 80 ?
, even at the hottest time , and always below 80 " at night , often requiring the closure of the bed-room windows , and occasionally a blanket in addition to the bed-clothes . ?

~ --The additional observations-those made some hours after the exertion-are given as illustrating an important fact , viz. the rapid manner in which , when the body is free from disease , the functions on rest return to their ordinary state ; whilst , on the contrary , when disease is present , especially of an organic kind , even though latent in relation to the most obvious class of symptoms , indications of it may be obtained by attention to the temperature , pulse and respiration ; and often , as in instances of pulmonary disease , in a very remarkable and decided manner .

On the Effct of Cool and Well-ventilated Rooms , and of Close and Heated Rooms on the Temperature .
As regards ventilation , and consequently coolness where there is a concourse of people , the cathedral church of Barbados , and HARRISON'S school-room adjoining , in which lectures were given on the opening of the REID School of Practical Chemistry , " may be mentioned as good and bad examples .
In illustration of the effects of each , I shall give a few observations on temperature , noted down when made , which was within about half an hour after quitting the church and the school , conveyed in a carriage , attending in the one divine service , in the other a lecture .
The temperature of the air marked , as usual , was that of ny sitting-rootnm , which was cooler by several degrees than the school-room , but less cool commrnonly than the church .

On the Effct of taking Food and Wine on the Temperature .
The effect of a meal in inoderation , whether the light one of breakfast or the fuller and heavier one of dinner , was to raise the temperature ; and this also when wine was sparingly used at the latter , viz. to the extent of two or three glasses ; but when more freely drunk , as it commonly is in company , then often its influence on temperature appeared to be depressing .

It is also worthy of remark , that occasionally the effect at night was to increase the temperature of the body , and that in a marked manner ; but whether from some peculiar quality of the wine used , or from some deranged state of the system or other adventitious circumstance , I have not been able to determine .

Of the Effect of Sea-sickness on the Temperature .
During a voyage from Barbados to St. Christoplher , and from thence to Barbados in May and June 1848 , in a transport , stopping at some of the intermediate islands , an opportunity offered of making some observations on the effect of sea-sickness , from which I suffered more or less on the several days noticed in the subjoined Table .
The degree of sickness , often amounting to vomiting , was such as to render rising disagreeable .
Little food was taken on those days , excepting chicken broth with some bread ; no wine was drunk .
The observations were made in the sitting posture in bed in a well-ventilated cabin .

Comparing the several observations , perhaps the inference may be justifiable , that the tendency of sea-sickness , when not in its severest form , is of an equalizing kind in relation to the temperatture , pulse and respiration , -a tendency no doubt promoted by the little variation to whicth the sea atmosphere is liable , especially within the tropics .
On so obscure a subject , however , as sea-sickness , this remark is offered with some hesitation .
445 Of the Temperature at Sea , when not under the influence of Sea-sickness .
In returning from the West Indies in the well-appointed steam-packet Clyde , I availed nyself of the opportunity to continue the observations on temperature .
The results are given in the following Table , commencing on the day after leaving St. Thomas , when all feeling of sea-sickness had ceased , and ending on the 2nd of December , the day before coming in sight of the coast of England .
The weather during the greater part of the voyage was favourable : after leaving Fayal , on the 27th of November , it was more or less tempestuous ; on the 29th and 30th , it was necessary to have the cabin ports closed .
The observations were made in a well-ventilated cabin in the sitting posture , the port commonly open excepting at night .
The diet was fuller and more nourishing than that used in the West Indies , the appetite increasing on passing into a cooler climate ; ratliert more wine was used , viz. a pint of sound Bordeaux at dinner ; and the clothing was rendered warmer as required by dimrinution of warmth of atmosphere:f 'Position of ship Temperature under at noon .

48 33 6 44 98-7 98 97-6 58 62 48 14 15 ... 58 57 59 Comparing these results with those obtained in England and in the West Indies , they will be found to accord more with the former than the latter , the morning being on an average higher than those obtained at night .
The small range of temperature is also worthy of note , and its decrease with dimninution of atmospheric temperature .
In those instances in which the variation was greatest , the higher temperature noted down , was in the middle of the day , commonly in connection with active walking exercise just before taken , and the lower than ordinary at the same period of the day , was , after sitting for an hour or two exposed to the wind on deck .
Conclusions .
The following are some of the conclusions that appear to be either proved or rendered probable by the preceding results , or by those given in the Tables appended , supposing , as it is believed , that , were the observations extended to many individuals , no material discrepancy would be witnessed .
1 .
That the average temperature of man within the tropics is a little higher , nearly 1 ?
, than in a temperate'climate , such as that of England .
2 .
That within the tropics , as had befote been found in cooler regions , the temperature of the body is almost constantly fluctuating , -varying according to the variety of agencies to which it is subject , some of which are distinct , others obscure .
3 .
That the order of fluctuation observed there is different from that in a cooler climate , the minimum degree of temperature being commonly early in the morning , after the night 's rest , and not at night previous to going to rest .
4 .
That all exertion , whether of body or mind , except it be very gentle , coming under the designation of passive rather than active exercise , has a heightening effect on the temperature , while the latter , the passive kind , has rather a lowering tendency , especially carriage exercise .
5 .
That heavy clothing , especially if tight and close , obstructing the admission and circulation of air , tends to raise the temperature unduly , especially under active exercise ; and that close , ill-ventilated rooms , especially when crowded , have in a marked manner the same tendency .
6 .
That when the body is in a healthy state , then on rest after exercise or exposure to any other exciting cause , it rapidly recovers its normal condition as to temperature .
7 .
That when labouring under disease , however slight , the temperature is abnormally elevated ; and that-judging from observations made , but not recorded , in the ables-its undue degree is some criterion of the intensity of the diseased action .
8 .
That within the tropics there is comparatively little difference of temperature between the surface of the body , especially the extremities and the internal parts ; and that there the skin is more active in its function of transpiration and the kidneys are less active as secreting organs ; with which it may be conjectured is connected a rapid production and desquamation of cuticle , and the absence , in great part or entirely , of lithic acid in the urinary secretion .
This latter fact , owever , may be explained in a different manner , on the supposition that the acid is not formed in the blood , or if formed , in a greatly diminished quantity .
9 .
That the effect of wine , unless used in great moderation , is ; commonly lowering , that is as to temperature , whilst it accelerates the heart 's action , followed after a while by an increase of temperature .
10 .
That the tendency of sea-sickness is to check what may be considered the natural fluctuation of the temperature , and when severe , like disease , to elevate the temperature .
That the tendency of a seas voyage , apart from sea-sickness , is to equalise the temperature without elevating it , an equalization that is best witnessed in voyaging in a tropical sea , where the atmospheric temperature is so little variable .
12 .
That even at sea , with a change of atmoqspheric temperature , there is a tendency to change of temperature of the body , the average increasing in proceeding towards the tropics , and diminishing in receding from them .
These conclusions obviously admit of application , and that-variously in relation to health and disease .
It would be unsuitable to the occasion to dwell on this part of the subject ; I shall merely remark , that it is a happy circumstance for man , and seetmts wisely ordered , that fluctuation of temperature should be connected with a healthy state of the system , and probably conducive to it , in whatever manner produced , whether by change of climate , or atinospheric variation , or by exercise , whether of body or mind .
The excellent health which the crews of the West Indian steam-packets have , that are in constant transition from heat to cold , is a striking proof of this , and other instances of a like kind , were it necessary , might be adduced in confirmation .

Received May 8 , -Read May 16 , 1850 .
The thermometer with which the preceding observations were made was broken immediately after my return to England , when travelling by railway , no special precaution having been taken in the packing of it , as by enclosing it in elastic horse-hair ; and in consequence I had not the means at once of making further trials on temperature for the purpose of comparison .
Recently , having had another thermometer constructed as delicate as that before used and divided with the same minutenesseach degree of FAHRENHEIT into ten parts-I have been enabled to continue the trials ; as yet , however , only for one month , that of April , without interruption .
They have been made thrice daily , at about the same hours as those recorded in my former paper .
The results , under ordinary circumstances of health , exercise , &amp;c. , have accorded with those then obtained , the highest temperature having been found to be immediately on rising in the morning after the night 's rest , and the lowest at night , just before retiring to rest .
This accordance will probably be received in proof that the difference of results in the West Indies and in England has been mainly owing to difference of clitnmate and the habits of life connected therewith ; and apart from these , to no change in the individual , the subject of the trials .
