When y is invariable , and n infinite , the density being uniform , p becomes - , and the mean density will always be expressed by 8p , since the attractive force is simply as the mean density : and if we divide gp by y , we shall have the relation of the mean density to the superficial density .

*14S5 575.435 2.28.28 1.57 ] [ o -1 *5.3 3-3.17 1.8 ] The reciprocals of the mean density are inserted , on account 86 of the simplicity of the progression which they exhibit , being in the first instance precisely equal to 1+ 4- , and varying but slowly from this value .
Now if we suppose , with Mr. LAPLACE , the mean density of the earth to be to that of the superficial parts as 1.55 to I , it appears from this table , that the height of the modulus of elasticity must be about.594 ; that is , more than lo million feet , while the modulus of the hardest and most elastic substances , that have been examined , amounts only to about o1 million .
It follows therefore , that the general law , of a compression proportionate to the pressure , is amply sufficient to explain the greater density of the internal parts of the earth ; and the fact demonstrates , that this law , which is true for small pressures in all substances , and with regard to elastic fluids , in all circumstances , requires some little modification for solids and liquids , the resistance increasing somewhat faster than the density : for no mineral substance is sufficiently light and incompressible to afford a sphere of the magnitude of the earth , and of so small a specific gravity , without some such deviation from the general law .
A sphere of water would be incomparably more dense , and one of air would exceed this in a still greater proportion : indeed , even the moon , if she is really perforated , as has sometimes been believed , and contains cavities of any considerable depth , would soon have absorbed into her substance the whole of her atmosphere , supposing that she ever had one .
It may be objected , that the resistance of solids to actual compression may possibly be considerably greater than appears in our experiments , since we are not absolutely certain that they 87 do not extend in a transverse direction , when we compress them in a longitudinal one , as is obviously the case with some soft elastic substances : but this objection is removed by the experiment on the sound of ice , which affords , either accurately or very nearly , the same resistance to compression as a portion of water confined in a strong vessel ; and this it could not do , if the particles of ice were allowed to expand laterally under the operation of a compressing force .
Mr. LAPLACE'S conclusion , respecting the precise proportion of the densities , is indeed derived from another supposition respecting their variation , and would be somewhat modified by the adoption of this theory ; it would not , however , be so materially altered , as by any means to invalldate the general inference .
It would therefore be proper to revise the calculations derived from the lunar motions and the ellipticity of the earth , and to employ in them a variation of density somewhat resembling that which is here investigated .
Indeed without reference to the effects of compressibility , it is obviously probable that the density of the earth should vary more considerably in a given depth towards the surface than near the centre , although the calculation , upon Mr. LAPLACE'S more simple hypothesis , of a uniform variation , is much less intricate .
It would however be justifiable , as a first approximation , to reject those terms of the series which would vanish if n and x were very small , and to make y=i+ ax ' ; and indeed this formula has in one respect an advantage over the series , as it seems to approach more nearly to the law of nature , in expressing a resistance somewhat greater towards the centre , where the density is most augmented : we have then , if the superficial density be to he 88 mean as 1 to q , q=i whence a =- ; and if q 1.55 , a= --.58 , affording an expression which is , in all probability , accurate enough for every astronomical purpose .
If the variation of density were supposed to proceed eqUably with the variation of quantity , it would obviously be as the square of the distance from the centre , and the density would be as 1 ax3 , the mean density being found at the surface of a sphere containing half as much as the whole earth ; and this might be considered as the most natural hypothesis , if we disregarded the effects of compression : but the arithmetical progression of densities , from the centre to the surface , seems in every way improbable .

On the irregularities of the earth 's suiface .
A. If we suppose the plumb line to deviate from its general direction on account of the attraction of a circumscribed mass , situated at a moderate depth below the earth 's surface , the distance of the two points of greatest deviation from each other will be to the depth of the attracting point as 2 to V 2 .
Let the magnitude of the additional mass be to that of the earth as a to i , and let its distance from the centre be b ; then supposing the earth a sphere , and its radius unity , and calling the angular distance of any point from the semidiameter passing through the mass x , the linear distance from the mass will be ^/ ( x + ( fx b)2 ) = V(fx + 'x2bx + b ) =(+ b2b9x ) ; consequently the disturbing attraction will be -_ _a -- : but the sine of the angle subtended by the two MDcecxIX .
N 89 centres of attraction will be to their distance b as fxt to the oblique distance v/ ( i + b-26bx ) ; it will therefore be expressed by -- ; and the sine of the very small -pressed by V(i +bb -2zbyx ) ' angular deviation of the joint force from the radius will be to the line measuring the disturbing force as this last sine to the radius , the difference of the third side of the triangle from the radius being inconsiderable ; consequently the deviation will be every where expressed by ( bf , +d .
v Now ~~Jwill ( i+-bbzbqx ) d in order to find where this is greatest , we must make its fluxion vanish , and o= C-dx -'3 -z2bl , ( i+bb-~zbx ) i2 ( x+bb-29zbx)1 px ( 1 + b2 h b ) =3bfx , 3b92x b1'x --+ ( i +b ) Fx =b , F2 +_ 9x , 3and F V( +[ ^2bb -^ but , b making b -c , b becomes - ?

B. The sine of the greatest deviation of the plumb line will amtount to d.385 -c- , a being the disturbing mass , and c cc its depth .

also a.618c2d , and cV ( .385 - ) .
If the density were doubled throughout the extent of a sphere touching the surface internally , the radius being c , we should 9o have a= c3 and d.85c , and c.-,6d : but this is a much greater increase of density than is likely to exist on a large scale : so that c must probably in all cases be considerably greater than this .
C. The greatest elevation of the general surface above the sphere will be a on the supposition that the mutual attraction of the elevated parts may safely be neglected .
The fluxion of the elevation is as the fluxion of the arc and as the deviation d conjointly ; it will therefore be expressed by -afd-x Now the fluxion of ( +bb2zbx ) i/ I +bb-zbx- ) bf , xdx is -4 consequently the fluent of the elevation will be a : and while Sx varies from i to i , this V/ ( t bb---2b x)ff ) fluent will vary from b to the difference being a( ' =-a a =o a -C-C r simply , ince cis 1i+b &amp; J ^C 2I-C 2C-- ?
ccC ' an extremely small fraction .
This quantity comprehends indeed the depression on the remoter side of the sphere , which would be required to supply matter for the elevation ; but it is obvious that such a depression must be wholly inconsiderable .
D. The diminution of gravity to the centre at the highest point is 2 while the increase from the attraction of the C disturbing mass is nearly -- , which is greater in the proportion that half the radius bears to c. E. The increase of gravity , at the pint of greatest deviation , is to the deviation itself , or its sine d , as Vs to 1 .
For the deviation is the measure of the horizontal attraction of the disturbing mass , which is to its vertical attraction 91 as fx to c , or as V1 to i. Thus if d were 5 " , or 06the horizontal force would be 7 o7- ' and the acceleration 20zo265 29170 of a pendulum 5--0 or 1.5 of time in a day .
It is true that a part of the deviation might depend on a defect of density as well as on ap excess ; but this defect could not amount to any great proportion of the whole , while the excess above the general density might easily be much more considerable , so that the acceleration of the pendulum could scarcely be less than a second in a day , if the greatest deviation of the plumb line were 5 " ; and if the deviation were 5 " at any other place , there would be a greater acceleration than a second at a point more or less remote from it .
F. If there were an excess of density on one side , and a deficiency on the other , so as to constitute virtually two centres of attraction and repulsion , and supposing their distances to be equal , and such as to produce the greatest deviation , if the excess of density were twice as great as the deficiency , a deviation of 5 " would correspond to an acceleration of half a second ; if 3 times as great , to 3 ; if 4 times , to , - ; and if five , to a second .
It may perhaps be considered as an omission in this calculation , that the attraction of the parts of the earth 's surface , elevated by means of the irregular gravitation , has not been included in it .
But it depends on the supposition that we may adopt respecting the cause and date of the irregularity , whether or no we ought to consider it as likely to have occasioned such a general elevation ; and it does not appear that the result of the computation would very materially alter our conclusions , though it would be somewhat laborious to go 92 through all its steps with precision .
It would indeed be so much the more superfluous to insist on this minute accuracy , as variations so much more considerable in the form of the earth 's surface are commonly neglected : for example , in the allowance made for the reduction of different heights to the level of the sea , which has usually been done without any consideration of the attraction of the elevated parts , interposed between the general surface and the place of observation .
It is however obvious , that if we were raised on a sphere of earth a mile in diameter , its attraction would be about 8-O of that of the whole globe , and instead of a reduction of 2-6o in the force of gravity , we should obtain only 8- , or three fourths as much : nor is it at all probable that the attraction of any hill a mile in height would be so little as this , even supposing its density to be only two thirds of the mean density , of the earth : that of a hemispherical hill would be more than half as much more , or in the proportion of 1.586 to i ; and it may easily be shown , that the attraction of a large tract of table land considered as an extensive flat surface , a mile in thickness , would be three times as great as that of a sphere a mile in diameter : or about twice as great as that of such a sphere of the mean density of the earth : so that , for a place so situated , the allowance for elevation would be reduced to one half : and in almost any country that could be chosen for the experiment , it must remain less than three fourths of the whole correction , deduced immediately from the duplicate proportion of the distances from the earth 's centre .
Supposing the mean density of the earth 5.5 , and that of the surface 2.5 only , the correction , for a tract of table land , will be reduced to 1--3 2.5 29 66 _-_ .

EULERa ' formula for the rolling pendulum .
I beg leave to observe , in conclusion , with regard to Mr. LAPLACE'S theorem for the length of the convertible pendulum rolling on equal cylinders , that its perfect accuracy may readily be inferred , without any limitation of the form of the pendulum , or of the magnitude of the cylinders , from the general and elegant investigation of EULER , which also affords us the proper correction for the arc of vibration .
This admirable mathematician has demonstrated , in the sixth volume of the Nova Acta Petropolitana , for 1788 , p. 145 , that if we put k for the radius of gyration with respect to the centre of gravity , a for the distance of the centre of gravity from the centre of the cylinder , c for the radius of the cylinder , h2 for 2+ ( a c)2 , and b for the sine of half of any very small arc of semivibration , we shall have , for the time of a complete oscillation , ( ag ) bb(4ac ) and ultimately , if b =o , ( bg ) only , which , for a simple pendulum , of the length a , V( ; -aa ) 'k and c both vanishing , becomes --- , and for any other length l , v(g ) ; consequently , making = ?
b we have V(g ) A/ V(2g ) v( .
zg ) ' , - , and and al=hh=+ aac + cc .
Now if we find another value of a , which will fulfil the conditions of the equation , all the other quantities concerned remaining unaltered , and add the two values together , we shall have the distance of the centres of the two cylinders corresponding to the length I of the equivalent pendulum ; but since --(Il + 2c ) a ks C6 , we have a -I c + ... , and al+c +_ ... .
, so that the sum of the two values of 94 a must be I+ 2c , that is , the distance of the centres of the cylinders must exceed the length I by twice the radius , and I must be precisely equal to the distance of their surfaces .

Corrections for Refraction .
i. A simple and convenient method of calculating the precise magnitude of the atmospherical refraction , in the neighbourhood of the horizon , has generally been considered as almost unattainable ; and Dr. BRINKLEY has even been disposed to assert the " ' impossibility of investigating an exact formula , " notwithstanding the " striking specimens of mathematical skill , which , " as he justly observes , " have been exhibited in the inquiry .
" We shall find , however , that the principal difficulties may be evaded , if not overcome , by some very easy expedients .
z. The distance from the centre of the earth being represented by x , and the weight of the superincumbent column by y , the actual density may be called x , and the element of y will vary as the element of x and as the density conjointly ; consequently die -mzdx ; the constant quantity m being the reciprocal of the modulus of elasticity .
The refractive density may be called I +pz , p being a very small fraction ; and it is easy to see that the perpendicular u , falling on the direction of the light , will always vary inversely as the refractive density , since that perpendicular continually represents the-sines of the consecutive angles , belonging to each of the concentric surfaces , at which the refraction may be supposed to take place .

The angular refraction at each point will obviously be directly as the elementary change of this perpendicular , and inversely as the distance v from the point of incidence ; whence the fluxion of the refraction will be ddr , as is already well known .
3 .
For the fluent of this expression , which cannot be directly integrated , we may obtain a converging series by means of the TAYLORIAN theorem ; but we must make the fluxion of the refraction constant , and du d2u rZ 3u r3 that of the density variable ; so that the equation will be u=rr+* +. .
, u being r ' ' d2 r3 z.3 the initial value of u , when r= o. Now the whole variation , of which u is capable , while z decreases from s du i to o , extends from to s ; or , since p is very small , from s--ps to s ; and dr being - , we have dv r2 xdx-udu dv x dx the equation ps = vr + , zny 4 " 4ny ' 4ny v* J2nI 21111 --7-S - , or , isitially-p( zn 2n-2n4t-4n ) =m_p % v , Ir the xs z7 Xz5 I np s ' ( .

Now if we take for n the value 59 =.o9 , corresponding to the multiplier 45 , employed by Mr. LEs500 L IB , the refractions in the immediate neighbourhood of the horizon will become too great by about I ' ; a difference by far too considerable to be attributed to the errors of observation only ; and we must infer , that the law of temperature , obtained from the height of the line of congelation , is not correctly true , ifapplied to elevations remote from the earth 's suface .
Professor BESSEL'S approximation is also found to make the horizontal refraction too great .
Mr. LAPLACE'S formula , which affords a very correct determination of the refraction , is said to agree sufficiently well with direct observation also ; but in fact this formula gives a depression considerably greater than was observed by GAY LUSSAC , in the only case which is adduced in its support ; and the progressive depression follows a law which appears to be opposite to that of nature , the temperature varying less rapidly at greater than at smaller heights , while the observations of HuMBOL DT and others seem to prove that in nature they vary more rapidly .
Notwithstanding , therefore , the ingenuity , and even utility of Mr. LAPLACE'S formula , it can only be considered as an optical hypothesis , and we are equally at liberty to employ any other hypothesis which represents the results with equal accuracy ; or even to correct our formulas by comparison with astronomical observations only , without assigning the precise law of temperature implied by them .
The theory will however afford us some general indications for this II purpose ; showing , for example , that the coefficient of the second term cannot be smaller than s , whatever positive value we may attribute to n ; and if we adjust the second and fourth coefficients , so as to represent the refractions near the zenith and at the horizon , without regarding the value of the subsequent terms , we shall obtain the third , by dividing the fourth by half of the secornd ; since that part of the fourth coefficient , which occurs in the case of horizontal refraction , is always derived from the third by taking the fluxion with dv respect to v only , and is therefore found by multiplying the third by , whatever the relations of the other quantities concerned may be .
8 .
On every supposition , the coefficient of the first term must be - , and that of the second must not greatly differ from .
_s The third coefficient , on the hypothesis of a law analogous to Mr. LESLIE'S , will be i5oo - ; if we suppose the temperature to vary more uniformly , and make z=y ( i +tx-t ) , the number will become I9oo ; or , taking z =y.x , 2200 , m being 766 , and t 176 : and Mr. LAPLACE'S formula will of course give a value still larger .
In fact the result of observation is represented with sufficient accuracy by the equation.oooz8z2 =v r+ ( 2.5 ++ 34 v+ 3400 ( I 25+ .

: and this formula appears to be at least as accurate as the French tables .

The terrestrial refraction may be most easily determined by an immediate comparison with the angle subtended at the earth 's centre , the fluxion of which is -- , and is initially the first part of the coefvx v--dria ficient of the second term of the series already obtained , and is equal to 6 ; so that this angle , while it remains small , is six times the refraction : commonly , however , the refraction in the neighbourhood of the earth 's surface is somewhat less than in this proportion .
10 .
The effects of barometrical and thermometrical changes may be deduced from the fluxion of the equation , if we make m , -p , and n , or rather t , vary : and for this purpose it will be convenient to employ the forni 4 ps vr + 2m-t+ r2 , the value of the fraction , if we neglect the subsequent terms , becoming 3.41 ; and this expression is sufficiently accurate for calculating the whole refraction , except for altitudes of a few degrees .

The variation of tt 59 x 500 003The variation of t can only be determined from conjecture ; but supposing the alteration of temperature to cease at the height of about 4 miles , it must increase , with every degree that the thermometer rises at the earth 's surface , about dt dt 247 ThI and t being I -- will be ---i.004 .
The alterations of the barometer will affect pt bi m 519 x 120 dp 3958 x 5258 x 12 only , being for every inch above or below 30 .
It is evident , since m -= 395 57 b being p 30 13.57 bd the height of the barometer , and d the bulk of air compared to that of water , that m must diminish , as well as p , when the temperature increases ; and the correction for t being subtractive , the three variations will cooperate in their effects ; but the proportion will be somewhat different from that of the simple densities .
If we preferred the expression derived from Professor LEs L IE 's hypothesis , we should merely have to substitute 2dn for dt , and the variation depending on the law of temperature would become about as great .
It must however be limited to such changes as affect the lower regions of the atmosphere only , its " c argue .
meant " being the deviation from the mean temperature of the latitude ; but even in this form it cannot be satisfactorily applied to the observations at present existing ; although it appears to be amply sufficient to explain the irregularities of terrestrial refraction , as well as the uncommon increase of horizontal refraction in very cold countries : and we may even derive from all these considerations a correction of at least half a second , or perhaps of a whole second , for the sun 's altitude at the winter solstice , tending to remove the discordance , which has so often been found , in the results of some of the most accurate observations of the obliquity of the ecliptic .

Sec. R. S. Read January e2 , 1819 .
MY DEAR SIR , " HE results of some of your late experiments on the pendulum having led me to reflect on the possible inequalities in the arrangement of gravitating matter within the earth 's substance , as well as on the methods of appreciating the accuracy of a long series of observations in general , I have thought that it might be agreeable to you , to receive the conclusions which I have obtained from my investigations , in such a form as might serve either to accompany the report of your operations , or to be laid before the Royal Society as a distinct communication , i. On the estimation of the advantage of multiplied observations .
It has been a favourite object of research and speculation , among the authors of the most modern refinements of mathematical analysis , to determine the laws , by which the probability of occurrences , and the accuracy of experimental results , may be reduced to a numerical form .
It is indeed true , that this calculation has sometimes vainly endeavoured to substitute arithmetic for common sense , and at other times has exhibited an inclination to employ the doctrine of chances as a sort of auxiliary in the pursuit of a political object , not of experiments , otherwise so easily attainable ; but we must recollect , that at least as much good sense is required in applying our mathematics to objects of a moral nature , as would be sufficient to enable us to judge of all their relations without any mathematics at all : and that a wise government and a brave people may rely with much more confidence on the permanent sources of their prosperity , than the most expert calculators have any right to repose in the most ingenious combinations of accidental causes .
It is however an important , as well as an interesting study , to inquire in what manner the apparent constancy of many general results , which are obviously subject to great and numerous causes of diversity , may best be explained : and we shall soon discover that the combination of a multitude of independent sources of error , each liable to incessant fluctuation , has a natural tendency , derived from their multiplicity and independence , to diminish the aggregate variation of their joint effect ; and that this consideration is sufficient to illustrate the occurrence , for example , of almost an equal number of dead letters every year in a general post office , and many other similar circumstances , which , to an unprepared mind , seem to wear the appearance of a kind of mysterious fatality , and which have sometimes been considered , even by those who have investigated the subject with more attention , as implying something approaching more nearly to constancy in the original causes of the events , than there is any just reason for inferring from them .
This statement may be rendered more intelligible by the simple case of supposing an equal large number of black and white balls to be thrown into a box , and loo of them to be drawn out either at once or in succession .
It may then be demonstrated , as will appear hereafter , from the number of ways in which the respective numbers of each kind of balls may happen to be drawn , that there is 1 chance in 2le that exactly 5o of each kind may be drawn , and an even chance that there will not be more than 53 of either , though it still remains barely possible that even ioo black balls or loo white may be drawn in succession .
From a similar consideration of the number of combinations affording a given error , it will be easy to obtain the probable error of the mean of a number of observations of any kind ; beginning first with the simple supposition of the certainty of an error of constant magnitude , but equally likely to fall on either side of the truth , and then deducing from this supposition the result of the more ordinary case of the greater probability of small errors than of larger ones .
This liability to a constant error may be represented , by supposing a counter to have two faces , marked o and 2 ; the mean value of an infinite number of trials will then obviously be l , and the constant error of each trial will be i , whether positive or negative .
Now in a combination of it trials with such a counter , if we divide the sum of the results by n , the greatest possible error of the mean thus found will be i ; and the probability of any other given error will be expressed by the number of combination of the faces of n counters afifrding that error , divided by the whole number of combinations ; that is , by the corresponding coefficient of the binomial ( i + i)n , divided by n , the sum of the coefficients .
The calculation therefore will stand thus : n=2 -z =3n4n=68 oeffticents XII3 33 I64II6 Is 20 ... 18 28 56 7o,. .

2'7T0* t. I I. o i ' I It is easy to perceive that these coefficients must express the true numbers of the combinations , since they are formed by adding together the two adjacent members of the preceding series ; thus when n is g , i combination giving the number o and 3 the number , these two combinations , being again respectively combined with 2 and o of a fourth counter , give i tg = 4 , ibr the combinations affording the number 2 in the next series ; while each succeeding series must continue to begin and end with unity , since there is only one combination that can afford either of the extremes .
In order to continue the calculation with greater convenience , we must find a general expression for the middle terms , a , 6 , o2 , 70 ... , neglecting the odd values of n. The first , 2 , is made up of ( i +-1 i ) , the second , 6 , is ?
( 2 + 1 ) ; 2o is 2 ( 64 ) and 7o= ( o+ 15 ) : or 6 == ( 2 .

, and 70o-- .
consequently the terms of this series , divided by 2 " , will always express the mean errors already calculated .
From this value of the middle term we may easily deduce that of the neighbouring terms by means of the original formula n. -i i. the M2 In n+ 'C+ MfDCCCXIX .

-z , the product will be 6.312500 , whatever the value of n may be : and 8.273437 when that value is large , the factors of these o1.246094 two expressions will approach so near to ie.225586 each other that they may be considered as 14.209473 equal ; consequently the corresponding terms 16.196381 of either , taken between any two large va18.185471 lues of n , will vary in the subduplicate ratio eo.176196 of n , since their product , which may be con30.1444466 sidered as the square of either , varies in the 40.125363 simple ratio of n , so that the mean error may 50.112271 ultimately be expressed by v/ .
The vao0.102574 lue of p evidently approximates to that of 70.095022 the quadrant of a circle , of which the radius 80.088924 is unity : thus for n= 10 it is 1.6512 , and for 90.083868 n 1loo , 1.5788 , instead of 1.5708 ; and the 100.o79586 ultimate identity of these magnitudes has been demonstrated by EULER and others .
( See Mr. HEaRSCHEL"s Treatise on Series , in LACROIX , Engl .
Ed. n. 410 .
) The fraction thus found , rnultiplied by 2 ' , gives the number of combinations expressed by the middle term , in which the error vanishes , when n is even : and the whole number of combinations being also 9s , it is obvious that the fraction alone must express the probability of a result totally free from error .
The neighbouring terms on each side , for n= 1oo , are.078025,.073524 , and.066588 , the sum of the 7 being.51586o ; and since this sum exceeds i , it is obviously more probable that the result of loo trials will be found in some of these seven terms , than in any of the remaining 94 , and that the mean error will not exceed 3 When n is so large , that the terms concerned may be considered as nearly equal , the factors m be expresd bI i+ x , " " I't , may be expressed by l -2 6 Io 2 , i--3 i ... , and the terms themselves by i , n ' nn28 18 1 - , 8i - ... the negative parts forming the series .

) of which the sum , for q terms , is , ( 3 q+q+ q ) or ultimately 2 q3 ; consequently if we call the 3fl middle term e , we must determine q in such a manner as to have e(q -3 q3 ) e , and gq( a-2 q ) 42 but e has been already found , in this case , and neglecting at first the square of q , we have q= / V ( pn ) and q~ = 7'6 ----~----2 P r.

75 We must not , however , lose sight , in this calculation , of the original condition of liability to a certain constant error in each trial .
For example , we may infer from it , that if we made ioo observations of the place of a luminary , each differing ' from the truth , but indifferently on either side of it , the error of the mean result would probably not exceed -o .
8.6 " ; and that in tooo observations it would probably be reduced to about a second .
Now although , in the methods of observing which we employ , the error is liable to considerable variations , yet it may be represented with suffcient accuracy , by the combination of two or more experiments in which the simpler law prevails .
For example , the combination of two counters , such as have beel considered , is equivalent to the effect of a die with four faces , or a tetraedron , marked o , 2 , 2 , and 4 , or with errors expressed by i , o , o , and -i ; the combination of three counters is represented by a die having eight faces , or an octaedron , with the errors i , i , ,i , - , -- , 1 -1 ; and the combination of four , by a solid of 16 sides , with the errors , 4 x , 6x o , 4x - , -1 .
These distributions evidently resemble those which are generally found to take place in the results of our experiments ; and it is of the less consequence to represent them with greater accuracy , since the minute steps , by which the scale of error varies , have no sensible effect on the result , especially when the number of observations is considerable .
If , for example , instead of two trials with the tetraedron , having the errors , o , o , i , we made two trials with a solid of s1 faces , having the errors distributed equally from 1,.9,.8. .
to-1 , the mean error of all tlw possible combinations would only 76 vary from.a75 to.849 ; and in a greater number of trials the errors would approach still nearer to equality .
Now in order to employ any of these suppositions for the purpose of calculation , it is only necessary to compute the corresponding mean error , and to make it equal to the actual mean error of a great number of observations .
Thus , if we consider each observation as representing a binary combination of counters or constant errors , in which the mean error is j , and adding together the differences of the several results from the mean , and dividing by their numbers , we find the mean error of 1oo observations i ' , we must consider the original constant error as equal to 2 , which is to be made the unit for 0oo primitive combinations ; and -/ 679Io=.04286 ; and i/ ZOO 200 the probable error of the mean will be.o4,6 x 120 -= 5.1 .
For a quaternary combination , if the error , which amounts to 3 , be found s ' , the unit will be - ' , and for n 400 , we have,03125 x= 5.o " .
And if we set out with a large number m of combinations , the mean error being V/ _L e , the unit pmni will be eV ( pm ) = r , and the probable error of nm trials being equal to this unit multiplied by.54 / t , , nleglecting the very small fraction.- , we have O.54 vev ( pm ) - we have.54g ve V ( po ) 54e PVIe =.8514 / e which , ife be i ' , and n oo , gives again 5 .
1 " , It appears therefore that the supposition , respecting the number of combinations representing the scale of error , scarcely makes a perceptible difference in the result , after the exclusion of the constant error : and that we may safely represent the probable error of the mean result of n observations , by the expression.85 - , e being the mean of all the actual errors .
We might obtain a conclusion nearly similar by considering the sum of the squares of the errors , amounting always to n2n but besides the greater labour of computing the sum of the squares of the errors of any series of observations , the method , strictly speaking , is somewhat less accurate , since the amount of this sum is affected in a slight degree by any error which may remain in the mean , while the simple sum of the errors is wholly exempted from this uncertainty .
In other respects the results here obtained do not materially differ from'those of LEGENDRE , BESSEL , GAUSS , and LAPLACE : but the mode of investigation appears to be more simple and intelligible .
It may therefore be inferred from these calculations , first , that the original conditions of the probability of different errors , though they materially affect the observations themselves , do not very greatly modify the nature of the conclusions respecting the accuracy of the mean result , because their effect is comprehended in the magnitude of the mean error from which those conclusions are deduced : and secondly , that the error of the mean , on account of this limitation , is never likely to be greater than six sevenths of the mean of all the errors , divided by the square root of the number of observations .
But though it is perfectly true , that the probable error of the mean is always somewhat less than the mean error divided by the square root of the number of observations , provided that no constant causes of error have existed ; it is still very seldom safe to rely on the total absence of such causes ; especially as our means of detecting them must be limited by the accuracy of our observations , not assisted , in all instances , by the tendency to equal errors on either side of the truth ; and when we are comparing a series 78 of observations made with any one instrument , or even by any one observer , we can place so little reliance on the absence of some constant cause of error , much greater than the probable result of the accidental causes , that it would in general be deceiving ourselves even to enter into the calculation upon the principles here explained : and it is much to be apprehended , that for want of considering this necessary condition , the results of many elegant and refined investigations , relating to the probabilities of error , may in the end be found perfectly nugatory .
These are cases in which some little assistance may be derived from the doctrine of chances with respect to matters of literature and history : but even here it would be extremely easy to pervert this application in such a manner , as to make it subservient to the purpose of clothing fallacious reasoning in the garb of demonstrative evidence .
Thus if we were investigating the relations of two languages to each other , with a view of determining how far they indicated a common origin from an older language , or an occasional intercourse between the two nations speaking them , it would be important to inquire , upon the supposition that the possible varieties of monosyllabic or very simple words must be limited by the extent of the alphabet to a certain number ; and that these names were to be given promiscuously to the same number of things , what would be the chance that i , 2 , 3 or more of the names would be applied to the same things in two independent instances .
Now we shall find , upon consideration , that for n names and n things , the whNole number of combinations , or rather permutations of the whole nomenclature would be m. 2 .

Hence we may easily obtain the successive values of a from each other , the first being obviously 1 , as a single name can only be given in one way to a single thing , therefore , a3 6-3 =2 a4 = 24-6--8 =9a o120I 10--20-45 = 44 a6 = 720-1-1 40135 264 265 a7 5040 i-217035-924-855 1854 a8 = 40320I --28-112-630-2464 7420.14832 14833 a= 36288036 168 1134 554422260 6674433497= 133496 ao = 3628800--45-.240 -18901088 55650 -2224--667485 -133496e 133496 From this computation it may be inferred , that , for lo names , the probabilities will No coincidence.367880 One only.36788o Two only.183941 Three only.o61o39 Four only.o15336 Five only.003056 Six only.o00oo51 stand thus : One or more Two or more Three or more Four or more Five or more Six or more Seven or more.632120.264240.080300.018991.003655 -000599.oooS99.000078 8o Seven only.oooo66 Eight or more.00001ooo Eight only.0oool0 Nine or Ten.o0oooo0 The same results may be still more readily obtained from the supposition that n is a very large [ number ; for then , theprobability of a want of coincidence for a single case being .

9~3~ ; 9 52 00 It appears therefore that nothing whatever could be inferred with respect to the relation of two languages from the coincidence of the sense of any single word in both of them ; and that the odds would only be 3 to i against the agreement of two words : but if three words appeared to be identical , it would be more than o to 1 that they must be derived in both cases from some parent language , or introduced in some other manner ; six words would give near 1700 chances to i , and 8 near oo0 , oo : so that in these last cases the evidence would be little short of absolute certainty .
In the Biscayan , for example , or the ancient language of Spain , we find in the vocabulary accompanying the elegant essay of Baron W. voN HUMBOLDT , the words berria , new ; ora , a dog ; guchi , little ; oguia , bread ; otsoa , a wolf , whence the Spanish onza ; and zazpi , or , as LACROZE writes it , shashpi , seven .
Now in the ancient Egyptian , new is BERI ; a dog , uHoR ; little , KUDCHI ; bread , OIK ; a wolf , UONSH ; and seven , SHASHF ; and if we consider these words as sufficiently iden .
tical to admit of our calculating upon them , the chances will be more than a thousand to one , that , at some very remote period , an Egyptian colony established itself in Spain : for none of the languages of the neighbouring nations retain any traces of having been the medium through which these wordci have been conveyed .
On the other hand , if we adopted the opinions of a late learned antiquary , the probability would be still incomparably greater that Ireland was originally peopled from the same mother country : since he has collected more than loo words which are certainly Egyptian , and which he considers as bearing the same sense in Irish ; but the relation , which he has magnified into identity , appears in general to be that of a very faint resemblance : and .
this is precisely an instance of a case , in which it would be deceiving ourselves to , attempt to reduce the matter to a calculation .
The mention of a single number , which is foutd tp be inb 8~ disputably correct , may sometimes afford a very strong evidence of the accuracy and veracity of a historian .
If the number were indefinitely large , the probability that it could not have been suggested by accident would amount to an absolute certainty : but where it must naturally have been confined within certain moderate limits , the confirmation , though somewhat less absolute , may still be very strong .
For example , if the subject were the number of persons collected together for transacting business , it would be a fair presumption that it must be between 2 or 3 and oo , and the chances must be about 0oo to i that a person reportilg it truly must have some good information ; especially if it were not an integral number of tens or dozens , which may be considered as a species of units .
Now it happens that there is a manuscript of DIoDoRUS SICULUS , which , in describing the funerals of the Egyptians , gives 42 for the number of persons who had to sit in judgment on the merits of the deceased : and in a multitude of ancient rolls of papyrus , lately found in Egypt , it may be observed , that 42 personages are delineated , and enumerated , as the judges assisting Osiris in a similar ceremony .
It is therefore perfectly fair to conclude from this undeniable coincidence , that we might venture to bet ioo to i , that the manuscript in question is in general more accurate than the others which have been collated ; that DIODORUS SICULUS was a well informed and faithful historian ; that the graphical representations and inscriptions in question do relate to some kind of judgment ; and lastly , that the hieroglyphical numbers , found in the rolls of papyrus , have been truly interpreted .

On the mean density of the earth .
It has been observed by some philosophers , that the excess of the density of the central parts of the earth , above that of the superficial parts , is so great as to render it probable that the whole was once in a state of fluidity , since this is the only condition that would enable the heaviest substances to sink towards the centre .
But before we admit this inference , we ought to inquire , how great would be the effect of pressure only in augmenting the mean density , as far as we can judge of the compressibility of the substances , which are the most likely to be abundant , throughout the internal parts of the structure .
Supposing the density at the distance x from the centre to be expressed by y , the fluxion die will be jointly proportional to the thickness of the elementary stratum , or to its fluxion -dx , to the actual density y , and to the attraction of the interior parts of the sphere , which varies as yxxx ; since the increment of pressure , and consequently that of density , depends on the combination of these three magnitudes : we have therefore ndy =yd f-d ; an equation which will readily afford us the value of y in a series of the form 1+ax + bx4+ ... In order to determine the coefficients , we must first find Jxxdx X+4 ax3+ 4b.b -. .
, and multiplying this by ( + ax"+b4+ ... ) dx , we obtain ny --n-nax2 nbx -ncx* -- .
