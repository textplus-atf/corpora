( Abstract .
) This paper is a continuation of a former paper 'r On the Joints of the Old Red Sandstone of the Co. Waterford , " published in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' for 1858 , and contains the results of the author 's observations for some years , in Donegal , the MVourne and Newry Mountains , Cornwall , and Fermanagh , with deductions from theory .
The author establishes the existence in Waterford of a Primary Conjugate System of Joints , and of two Secondary Conjugate Systemus , lying at each side of the Primary at angles of 270 5 ' and 370 11 ' .
In Donegal there exists a Primary Conjugate System , and a Secondary System , making with the Primary an angle of 32§ 24 ' .
In the Morn and Newry Mountains there is a Primary Conjugate System , and two Secondary Systems at each side of the Primary , making angles of 3lI 46 ' and 30 56 ' .
In Cornwall there is a Primary and also a Secondary Conjugate System , making an angle of 270 28 ' .
And in Fermanagh there are Primary and Secondary Systems , forming an angle of 31§ 1 ' .
Having given , in detail , the observations on which the preceding results are founded , the author says:- " Collecting together into one Table the results of the preceding observations , we find the following Table of Primary and Secondary Joints ( True Bearings ) Name .

The Rev. S. Haughton on the Joint Systems Dimethoxalic acid is a white solid , readily crystallizing in beautiful prisms resembling oxalic acid .
It fuses at 75§ 7 C. , volatilizes slowly even at common temperatures , and readily sublimes at 50 ?
C. , being deposited upon a cool surface in magnificent prisms .
It boils at about 212 ?
C. , and distils unchanged .
Dimethoxalic acid reacts strongly acid , and unites with bases , forming a numerous class of salts , several of which are crystalline .
In addition to the baryta-salt above mentioned , we have examined the silversalt , which is best formed by adding oxide of silver to the free acid , heating to boiling , and filtering , when the salt is deposited in star-like masses of nacreous scales as the solution : cools .
On analysis , this salt gave numbers closely correspcding with those calculated from the formula C H3 C0 OH o Ag Attempts to produce an ether by digesting the free acid with absolute alcohol at a temperature gradually raised to 160 ?
C. proved abortive , traces only of the ether being apparently formed .
Thus the final result of the action of zinc upon a mixture of iodide and oxalate of methyl is perfectly homologous with that obtained by the action of zincethyl upon oxalic ether .
In the methylic reaction , however , no compound corresponding to leucic ether was obtained .
This cannot create surprise when it is remembered that dimethoxalic ether approaches closely in composition to lactic ether , which is well known to be instantly decomposed by water .
We have sought in vain to obviate this decomposition of dimethoxalic ether by adding absolute alcohol in place of water to the product of the reaction .
