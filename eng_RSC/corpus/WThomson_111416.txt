" On the Electric Conductivity of Commercial Copper of various kinds .
" By Professor W. THOM3SON , F.R.S , Received June 17 , 1857 .
In measuring the resistances of wires manufactured for submarine telegraphs , I was surprised to find differences between different specimens so great as most materially to affect their value in the electrical operations for which they are designed .
It seemed at first that the process of twisting into wire-rope and covering with guttapercha , to which some of the specimens had been subjected , must be looked to to find the explanation of these differences .
After , however , a careful examination of copper-wire strands , some covered , some uncovered , some varnished with india-rubber , and some oxidized by ignition in a hot flame , it was ascertained that none of these circumstances produced any sensible influence on the whole resistance ; and it was found that the wire-rope prepared for the Atlantic cable ( No. 14 gauge , composed of seven No. 22 wires , and weighing altogether from 109 to 125 grains per foot ) conducted about as well , on the average , as solid wire of the same mass : but , in the larger collection of specimens which thus came to be tested , still greater differences in conducting power were discovered than any previously observed .
It appeared now certain that these differences were owing to different qualities of the copper wire itself , and it became important to find how wire of the best quality could be procured .
Accordingly , samples of simple No. 22 wire , and of strand spun from it , distinguished according to the manufactories from which they were supplied , were next tested , and the following results were obtained : Table of relative conducting qualities of single No. 22 Copper wire , supplied from manufactories A , B , C , D.

197'6 111-7 , , 182-0 54-9 The strands spun from wire of the same manufactories showed nearly the same relative qualities , with the exception of an inversion as regards the manufactories B and D , which I have been led to believe must have arisen from an accidental change of labels before the specimens came into my hands .
Two other samples chosen at random about ten days later , out of large stocks of wire supplied from each of the same four manufactories , were tested with different instruments , and exhibited , as nearly as could be estimated , the same relative qualities .
It seems , therefore , that there is some degree of constancy in the quality of wire supplied from the same nianufactory , while there is vast superiority in the produce of some manufactories over that of others .
It has only to be remarked , that a submarine telegraph constructed with copper wire of the quality of the manufactory A of only of an inch in diameter , covered with gutta-percha to a diameter of a quarter of an inch , would , with the same electrical power , and the same instruments , do more telegraphic work than one constructed with copper wire of the quality D , of -^ of an inch diameter , covered with gutta-percha to a diameter of a third of an inch , to show how important it is to shareholders in submarine telegraph companies that only the best copper wire should be admitted for their use .
When the importance of the object is recognized , there can be little difficulty in finding how the best , or nearly the best , wire is to be uniformly obtained , seeing that all the specimens of two of the manufactories which have as yet been examined have proved to be of the best , or little short of the best quality , while those of the others have been found inferior in nearly constant proportion .
What is the cause of these differences in electrical quality is a question not only of much practical importance , but of high scientific interest .
If chemical composition is to be looked to for the explanation , very slight deviations from perfect purity must be sufficient to produce great effects on the electric conductivity of copper ; the following being the results of an assay by Messrs. Matthey and Johnson , made on one of the specimens of copper wire which I had found to be of low conducting power : Copper ... ... ... ... .

01 100-00 The whole stock of wire from which the samples experimented on were taken , has been supplied by the different manufacturers as remarkably pure ; and being found satisfactory in mechanical qualities , had never been suspected to present any want of uniformity as to value for telegraphic purposes , when I first discovered the difference in conductivity referred to above .
That even the worst of them are superior in conducting power to some other qualities of commercial copper , although not superior to all ordinary copper wire , appears from the following set of comparisons which I have had made between specimens of the No. 22 A wire , ordinary copper wire purchased in Glasgow , fine sheet-copper used in blocks for calico-printers , and common sheet-copper .

The result shows that the greatest degree of brittleness produced by tension does not alter the conductivity of the metal by as much as one half per cent. A similar experiment showed no more sensible effect on the conductivity of copper wire to be produced by hammering it flat .
There are , no doubt , slight effects on the conductivity of metals , produced by every application and by the altered condition left after the withdrawal of excessive stress* ; and I have already made a partial examination of these effects in copper , iron , and platinum wires , and found them to be in all cases so minute , that the present results as to copper wire are only what was to be expected .
To find whether or not there is any sensible loss of conducting power on the whole due to the spiral forms given to the individual wires when spun into a strand , it would be well worth while to compare very carefully the resistances of single wires with those of strands spun from exactly the same stock .
This I have not yet had an opportunity of doing ; but the following results show that any deficiency which the strand may present when accurately compared with solid wire , is nothing in comparison with the differences presented by different samples chosen at random from various stocks of solid wire and strand in the process of preparation for telegraphic purposes .

It is impossible to over-estimate the great practical value of this system of absolute measurement carried out by Weber into every department of electrical science , after its first introduction into the observations of terrestrial magnetism by Gauss .
