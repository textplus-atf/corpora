Astronomical observations and experiments , selected for the purpose of ascertaining the relative distances of clusters of stars , and of investigating how far the power of our telescopes may be expected to reach into space , when directed to ambiguous celestial objects .
By Sir Williamn Herschel , Knt. Guelp .
LL. D F. R. S. Read June 1i , 18i8 .
IN my last paper on the local arrangement of the celestial bodies in space , I have shown how , by an equalization of the light of stars of different brightness , we may ascertain their relative distances from the observer , in the direction of the line in which they are seen ; and from this equalization , a method of turning the space-penetrating power of a telescope into a gradually increasing series of gaging powers has been deduced , by which means the profundity in space , of every object consisting of stars , can be ascertained , as far as the light of the instrument which is used upon this occasion will reach .
This method has already been applied to fathom the milky way , and may with equal propriety be used to ascertain the profundity of globular and other clusters of stars in space ; I shall therefore make use of some of the numerous observations , contained in my journals and sweeps of the heavens , to show how the distances of these objects may be obtained ; and shall also attempt to represent their situation in space by a figure , in which their distances are made proportional to the diameter of a globular space , sufficiently large to contain all the stars that in the clearest nights are visible to the eye of an observer , I. Of the distance of globular and other clusters of stars .
In observations which are made for ascertaining the distance of a cluster of stars , it is necessary that the gaging power should be marked , which will just make some of the stars belonging to it visible in the telescope that is used for this purpose .
If the cluster is of a globular form , but is not insulated , the stars that belong to it may be easily distinguished from those which may happen to be scattered about , or upon it .
In clusters of a different construction , the compression , or the apparent size of the stars , must direct the observer .
It is to be remarked , that neither the brightness , nor the diameter of the clusters of which the distance is to be ascertained , are to be considered : some of them are bright enough to be perceived by the eye ; others are visible in the finder of the telescope , and many of them can only be seen in the telescope itself .
These are circumstances that have no influence on the exactness of the result of the gaging power ; but as they regard our knowledge of the construction of these magnificent sidereal systems , an abridged account of them is given , with the observations by which their profundity in space is ascertained ; and in the arrangement of these observations , I have followed the order of the space-penetrating power of the instruments by which they were made .
In recording the examination of celestial objects , I have often applied to them the expressions resolvable , or easily resolvable , when , from their appearance , I could not decide 430 whether they belonged to the class of nebula , properly so called , or whether they might not consist of an aggregation of stars , at too great a distance from us to be distinctly perceived ; but it is evident that the distance of a cluster of stars cannot be ascertained , as long as it remains doubtful whether the object consists of stars ; and that , consequently , their first perceptibility must be the gaging power by which its profundity in space is to be ascertained .

A series of observations of clusters of stars , from which the order of their profundity in space is determined .
Observation of the 7th cluster of stars in the with class of my catalogues of celestial objects.* " 1784 , 2o feet telescope , power 15 .
An excessively faint " cluster of stars , intermixed with resolvable nebulosity , 8 or " 10 minutes in diameter .
The stars are so small that they ( cannot be seen without the greatest attention ; e4o verified " it beyond all doubt .
I have suspected many such in this 'c neighbourhood .
" At the time of this observation , the Qo feet telescope was of the NEWTONIAN construction , and its power to penetrate into space was 61.i8 times that of the eye , which it has been shown can see stars of the 10th order : and since it appears from the foregoing observation , that with this power the telescope could but just reach the stars of the cluster , we may conclude that its profundity in space cannot be less than of the 734th order .
Observation of the gth cluster in the with class .
1784 , eo feet telescope .
A large cluster of exceedingly " small , and compressed stars , about 6 or 7 minutes in ' diameter ; a great many of the stars are visible , the rest so " small as to appear nebulous ; those that are visible are of " one size , and are scattered all over equally .
The cluster is " of an irregular round form .
" The profundity of the cluster by this observation is of the 734th order .
Observation of the 1oth cluster in the with class .
1784 , 2o feet telescope .
A very compressed , considerably large cluster of the smallest stars imaginable ; " all the stars are of a dusky red colour .
This cluster is the " next step to an easily resolvable nebula .
" The ruddy colour of the stars is probably owing to its low situation ; the profundity of the cluster is of the 734th order .

It may be called the next step to an easily resolvable ' nebula .
It is about ior 9 minutes in diameter .

Of a method to represent the profundity of celestial objects in space by a diagram .
In order to represent the profundity of celestial objects in space , I shall have recourse to the construction of an astronomical globe , on the surface of which the situations of the heavenly bodies are pointed out to us in the given two dimensions of right ascension and polar distance ; but as their distance from an eye placed in the centre of the globe cannot be expressed by their situation on the surface , I shall endeavour to show that this deficiency may be artificially , supplied in a figure representing such a globe , by the addition of lines that are of a length which is proportional to the diameter of it .
It has been shown in my last paper , that all the stars which may be seen in the clearest nights , are probably contained within a globular space , of which the radius does not exceed the e1th order of distances ; I shall therefore suppose the circle c in the centre of fig. i , i[Plate XXI .
] to represent a celestial globe , containing all the stars that are generally marked on its surface ; their arrangement within this globular space , however , must be supposed to be according to their order of distances , the stars of the first order being placed nearest the centre , and those of the 2d , gd , and 4th , &amp;c. gradually farther off ; but they must all be placed in their well ascertained directions , so that a line from the centre drawn through any one of them may come to the surface at the place where its situation is marked .
According to this assumption it follows , that all those celestial objects which are farther than the 12th order of distances from the centre , must be represented as being at the outside of the globular space ; but as our celestial globes represent not only the situation of the stars of the heavens , but give us also many additional objects , such as clusters of stars , nebulae , and the milky way , it is evident that the point where the line of sight from the centre to any one of these distant objects , leaves the surface of the globular space , is ascertained ; and since any celestial object not inserted on our globes , of which the right ascension and polar distance are given , may be easily added , the position of the visual ray directed to such an object will thereby also be determined .
In my last paper I have drawn the attention of astronomers to the condition of the milky way , as being the most brilliant , and beyond all comparison the most extensive sidereal system ; and have also shown that the globular space containing all our visible stars , is situated within its compass ; I shall therefore now make the plane of it the principal dimension of my figure ; then if the line ab represent this plane , a perpendicular drawn from the centre c of the figure to d and to e , will be directed towards the north and south poles of it , and the situation of the globular space in the figure will be like that of a celestial globe adjusted to the latitude of go degrees , having the milky way in the horizon , :the 9goth degree of right ascension in the meridian , and the 6oth degree of north polar distance in the zenith .
From this description of the arrangement of the stars within the globular space , and its situation in the plane of the milky way , it is evident that , having already an expression for the position of a celestial object in two dimensions , the addition of the third , which is its profundity or central distance , may be represented by a line of a length that is proportional to the diameter of the globular space ; and if this line be a continuation of the direction in which the object is seen from the centre , its termination will show the real place of the object , and point out its situation with respect to the great sidereal stratum of the milky way .
An observer who looks at a celestial globe , and wishes to see the angle of the direction of the line in which an object is seen from the centre , will for this purpose turn the globe horizontally till the plane of the azimuth circle is at right angles to the line in which he looks at it ; or , if more convenient , he will change his position by going round the globe till he comes to the situation in which this angle will appear of its true magnitude .
In illustration of this , let NESW , figure 2 , [ P1 .
XXI .
J be the circle on which the azimuths of celestial objects are to be reckoned , and let the meridional line NS pass through the 19oth degree of right ascension at S ; then will the numbers at the circumference of the circle point out the degrees , and the quadrant of the azimuth of the situation in which any object is to be seen when referred to the milky way .
The particular use of this azimuth circle will appear , when the construction of the figure which expresses the profundity of the clusters of stars , of which I have given the observations , has been explained .
Having fixed upon the plane of the milky way as the region of the heavens to which the situation of the clusters of stars is to be referred , their right ascension and polar distance , which are required for this purpose , must be reduced to this plane ; and will appear under the denomination of elevation and azimuth .
The elevation from the plane of the milky way will be either north or south , and the azimuths in either the northern or southern hemisphere of it , will be in the northeast , south-east , north-west , and south-west quadrants .
In order to make this reduction , we have the construction of the triangle ABC , figure 3 , in which A is the pole of the heavens ; B the north pole of the milky way , and C the situation of the cluster of stars ; and there is given the side AB , which is the distance of the two poles ; the side AC , wiich is the polar distance of the cluster , and the angle A , which is the difference between the right ascension of the pole of the milky way and that of the cluster of stars .
From these data we find the side BC , the complement of which is the angle of the elevation of the cluster ; and the anigle ABC , or its supplement CBD , which gives the degree and the quadrant of the azimuth of the cluster .
When to these two particulars the profundity of a cluster is added , we have its local situation , with regard to the plane of the milky way , in the required three dimensions of space .
The following table is the result of a set of calculations made for the purpose of obtainingthe above mentioned particulars .

The first column points out the class and number , where the clusters taken from my catalogues are to be found , and only the number of those that are taken from the Connoissance des Temps for 1784 .
In the figure , the place of the cluster whose situation is to be examined is distinguished by the same mark as in the table namely VI , 7 .
The second column contains the distance of the same cluster from an eye placed in the centre of the globular space , the profundity of which is 734 , as determined by the observations that have been given .
In the figure it is expressed by the length of the line c VI , 7 drawn from the centre of it to the cluster , whose length is 734 , the radius of the circle representing the globular space being 12 .
The third column gives the angle of elevation of the cluster , which in the present instance is 76* 58 ' above the northern plane of the milky way .
In the figure it is expressed by the central meeting of the lines bc and c VI , 7 : one of which denotes this plane , and the other the profundity of the cluster .
To find the quantity of this angle , it is necessary to have the right ascension and polar distance of the cluster ; and here it will be proper to notice that I have deduced these requisites from my own observations of the clusters , brought to the beginning of the year 18oo .
Then to find the elevation of the present cluster by the method which has been explained , we have in figure 3 , the side AB = 6o ?
: the side AC = 71 ? ?
17 ' , being the polar distance of the cluster ; and the angle A 6* 56 ' 45 " , being the right ascension of the cluster 196 ? ?
56 ' 45 " minus 190o .
By these quantities we find BC _= 1O ?
' 28 " , and its complement 76 57 ' 3 " , which is the required elevation of the cluster VI , 7 .
The fourth column assigns the azimuth of the cluster ; and as the degrees of the quadrants of the azimuth circle in figure 2 , are numbered one from the south the other from the north , the letter S is prefixed to E , to show that the degrees of it are to be looked for in the south-east quadrant ; the quantity of the angle , in consequence of the foregoing calculation , is easily obtained ; for as we now already have the side BC , the opposite angle A , and the side AC , we find the supplemental angle CBD , which gives the azimuth 31 ? ?
43 ' 9 " .
By this result the situation of the direction , in which an observer in the centre of the globular space must look to see the cluster , is determined .
The fifth column contains the point of sight , or situation in which the eye of an observer should be placed , when , by the assis-tance of a celestial globe , the profundity of any cluster marked in the figure is to be examined .
This point , for the cluster VI , 7 , is 58 ? ?
17 ' south-west , which denotes that the globe must be turned horizontally till the 58th degree of the south-west quadrant directly faces the observer , or that , by changing his situation , he must place himself so as to face the globe in the assigned position .
I have called the construction of the figure which gives the profundity of the clusters , an artificial one ; because , as soon as the celestial globe is brought into the situation where it can be seen from the tabular point of sight , the figure will 458 always be found already prepared to show by inspection the azimuth , the elevation and the profundity of the cluster under examination ; for as the globe , which in its adjusted situatiot .
has the azimuth of the cluster VI , 7 , at right angles to the line of sight , so the globular space in the centre of the figure being supposed similarly arranged , has the tabular azimuth 31 ? ?
43 ' SE also at right angles to the line drawn to the figure , when seen from the point of sight 58o 17 ' SW. The direction from the centre of the globe to the place on its surface where the cluster is inserted , is also preserved in the continuation of it beyond the surface of the globular space , by the angle of its elevation 760 58 ' above the northern plane of the milky way .
The profundity of the cluster , as has already been noticed , is expressed by the continuation of the line of elevation to 734 such parts as the radius of the globular space contains is ; and it may not be amiss , by way of assisting our conception of the vast distance of the situation at which this cluster is placed , to state , that if a line directed to it were added to an 18 inch globe , supposed to contain all the visible stars of the heavens , its length to express this distance would be above 45 feet .
This figure which , from its construction , represents all the different aspects in which a celestial globe should be seen , when its horizontal position for any cluster is adjusted by the foregoing table , has the imperfection that , on account of the different azimuths of their situation , they cannot all be collected into one perspective view ; but as it affords the means of examining them separately , which may even be done without the assistance of the globe , this inconvenience is compensated by the advantage it has of showing all the angles of elevation , and the comparative lengths of the lines expressing the profundity of the clusters in their true magnitude , which an orthographic projection of their situation could not have done .
IV .
Of ambiguous celestial objects .
When the nature or construction of a celestial object is called ambiguous , this expression may be looked upon as referring either to the eye of the observer , or to the telescope by which it has been examined .
In the foregoing observations we find that the tith , isth , 15th , and 35th of the connoissance , when they are at a sufficient altitude for the purpose , may be seen by the eye ; but as , without artificial vision , they appear only under the semblance of very small , faint cloudy spots , we should not be able to decide whether they were of a nebulous or sidereal condition , if we were not informed by the telescope that they are brilliant clusters of stars ; the eye therefore sees them as ambiguous objects .
If these objects are ambiguous when only viewed by the ulnassisted eye , there are others that will appear to be so , when they are seen through such small telescopes as are generally attached to large ones , and are called finders , because they point out objects that are not visible to the eye .
With regard to these finders , I have occasionally used them of different sizes and constructions ; but from experience I can say , that a small one of a most simple composition , with a power of penetrating into space of about four times that of the eye , has generally been sufficient for all the purposes of a7 or 1Q feet telescope ; because these instruments may 46o \461i easily be made to act as finders to themselves , by using a double eye glass with a large field of view and a small magnifying power .
It is indeed very obvious that when a small telescope , acting as a finder to a larger one , has not sufficient light to show the objects we look for , a more powerful one must be used .
In this manner I have often been obliged to have recourse to a lo feet reflector as a finder , to point out the situation of an object to be viewed in the 20 feet telescope .
It may have appeared singular , that among the observations which have been given , there are many that were made by the 7 and 1o feet telescope finders , but the important use of these observations will appear in the consequences that may be drawn from them ; for the clusters of stars , No. 2 , 3 , 5 , 12 , 30,33 , 34 , 53 , 75 , and 92 of the connoissance were all to be seen in these finders ; they were , however , not seen as clusters of stars , but as ambiguous objects .
No. 12 , 30 , 34 , and 75 were but just to be perceived ; No. 2 and 92 appeared like stars with rather a large diameter ; No. 3 and 5 like hazy stars ; No. 33 and 53 like small hazinesses or nebulosities ; and yet they were all proved by the telescopes in which they were critically examined to be clusters of stars .
If then a cluster of stars in a very small telescope will appear like a star with rather a larger diameter than stars of the same size generally have , we shall certainly be authorised to conclude , that an object seen in a larger and more perfect telescope as a star with rather a larger diameter , is also an ambiguous object , and might possibly be proved to be a cluster of stars , had we a superior instrument by which we could examine its nature and construction .
This seems to throw some light upon a species of objects called stellar nebula , one hundred and forty of which have been inserted in my catalogues .
For as it has just been mentioned that a lo feet telescope may become a finder to a o2 feet one , the go feet telescope itself will be but a finder to objects that are so far out of its reach as not to appear otherwise than ambiguous ; nay , the 40 feet telescope , when it is but just powerful enough to show the existence of art object which decidedly differs from the appearance of a star , may then truly be called a finder .
V. The milky zvay , at the profundity beyond which the gaging powers of our instruments cannot reach , is not an ambiguous object .
Celestial objects can only be said to remain ambiguous , when the telescopes that have been directed to them leave it undetermined whether they are composed of stars or of nebulous matter .
Six observations of different parts of the milky way , relating to this subject , have already been given in my last paper , * to which the following four may be added .
Dec. 27 , 1786 .
Right ascension 6h 42 ' .
Polar distance 88 ? ?
33 ' .
There are 116 stars in the field of view , besides many too small for the gage .
Sept. 21 , 1788 .
Right ascension 21eh 29 ' .
Polar distance 41 ?
i ' .
There are about 360 stars in the field of view , but most of them are so small that it requires the utmost attention to see them .
Sept. 27 , 1788 , Right ascension 21h 17 ' .
Polar distance X See Phil. Trans. for 1817 , pages 325 , 326 , and 329 , 4A62 52 ? ?
50 .
With 157 there are small stars with suspected nebulosity ; 300 shows a great many smaller stars intermixed with the former .
Sept. 11 , 1790 .
Right ascension 9h 50 ' .
Polar distance 470 o ' .
About 240 stars in the field of view , with many too small to be counted .
In these ten observations the gages applied to the milky way were found to be arrested in their progress by the extreme smallness and faintness of the stars ; this can however leave no doubt of the progressive extent of the starry regions ; for when in one of the observations a faint nebulosity was suspected , the application of a higher magnifying power evinced , that the doubtful appearance was owing to an intermixture of many stars that were too minute to be distinctly perceived with the lower power ; hence we may conclude , that when our gages will no longer resolve the milky way into stars , it is not because its nature is ambiguous , but because it is fathomless .
VI .
Of the assumed semblance of clusters of stars , when seen through telescopes that have not light and power sufficient to show their nature and construction .
The variety of telescopes used in the long series of observations that have been given , will afford us many instances to ascertain the various deceptive appearances that clusters of stars may put on when they are observed with an inadequate apparatus .
An examination of some particulars relating to this subject may assist us to ascertain in what class we ought probably to place the numerous observations of ambiguous objects that in my sweeps of the heavens were seen by the 20 feet telescope ; and having already compared the different forms under which clusters of stars appeared in the finders of the instruments , I shall now also notice how they were seen in the gradually larger telescopes .
In the 2 feet NEWTONIAN sweeper , No. 92 of the connoissance appeared like a clouded star , with a magnifying power of 15 .
No. 2 , with a power of 24 , appeared like a telescopic comet .
In the 7 feet telescope , No. 77 was like an ill defined star , surrounded by nebulosity .
No 79 , with a power of 57 , appeared nebulous .
With 460 No. 3 could hardly be seen , for want of light .
No. o1 , with 227 , could not be resolved into stars , for want of power .
With 460 No. 22 wanted light , and with 227 it wanted power .
With a magnifier of 171 No. 33 had a nebulous appearance .
No. 1 was seen as light without stars .
In the io feet telescope , The light of No. 19 appeared mottled .
With a power of 71 No. So appeared like a pretty large cometic nebula , very gradually much brighter in the middle .
With the same power No. 75 , was small and cometic .
No. 77 had nearly the appearance of a large stellar nebula .
464 In the large o feet telescope , No. 97 , being too low for examination , had the appearance of a faint nebula .
The numerous ambiguous objects that have been seen in the 2o feet telescope do not properly come under this head ; for as none of them have been critically examined by superior telescopes , they must still remain ambiguous ; and it is for the purpose of being able to form some probable conjecture about the nature of these doubtful objects , that the foregoing results of the appearance of such as have been ascertained to be clusters of stars , have been pointed out .
It would be far too extensive to enter into particular applications , I shall therefore confine myself to a few general remrarks .
In the depth of the celestial regions , we have hitherto only been acquainted with two different principles , the nebulous and the sidereal .
The light of the nebulous matter is comparatively very faint , and , except in a few instances , invisible to the eye .
It is also in general widely diffused over a great expanse of space , in which , by an increase of faintness , it generally escapes the sight : the light of stars on the contrary , is comparatively very brilliant , and confined to a small point , except when many of them are collected together in clusters , when their united lustre sometimes takes pa considerable number of minutes of space ; but in this case the stars of them may be seen in our telescopes , and by the observations that have been given , it appears that when they are viewed with instruments gradually inferior to those which prove them to be clusters of stars , their diameters , seen with less light and a smaller magnifying power , are generally contracted ; a globular cluster is reduced to a cometic appearance ; to an ill defined star surrounded by nebulosity , and to a mere small star with rather a larger diameter than stars of the same size generally have .
In consequence of these considerations , it seems to be highly probable that some of the cometic , many of the planetary , and a considerable number of the stellar nebulae , are clusters of stars in disguise , on account of their being so deeply immersed in space , that none of the gaging powers of our telescopes have hitherto been able to reach them .
The distance of objects of the same appearances , but which are of a nebulous origin , on the contrary , must be so much less than that of the former , that their profundity in space may probably not exceed the 9ooth order .
VII .
Of the extent of thepowerof our telescopes to reach into space , when they are directed to amnbiguous celestial objects .
The method of equalising the light of stars on which the gaging power of telescopes has been established , may also be applied to give us an estimate of the extent of their power to reach ambiguous celestial objects .
When the united light of a cluster of stars is visible to the eye , thete will then be a certain maximum of distance to which the same cluster might be removed so as still to remain visible in a telescope of a given space-penetrating power ; and if the distance of this cluster can be ascertained by the gaging power of any instrument that will just show the stars of it , the order of the profundity at which the cluster could still be seen as an ambiguous object , may be ascertained by the space-penetrating power of the telescope through which it is observed .
But as the aggregate brightness of the stars depends entirely on their number and arrangement , this method can only be used with clusters of stars that have been actually observed .
The 85th of the connoissance , for instance , being visible to the eye as a small cloudiness , its profundity in space was , by an observation of the 7 feet telescope , shown probably not to exceed the 144th order ; then , as the stars that enter into the composition of this cluster are of such an arrangement that their united lustre may be seen by the eye at the distance of the 144th order , the lo feet telescope , by which this cluster was viewed , having a power of penetrating into space ?
8.67 times that of the eye , would be able to show this cluster as a small cloudiness , if it were removed to the distance of the 4128th order .
The so feet NEWTONIAN telescope , in which it was also observed , having a space-penetrating power 61.16 .
times that of the eye , would still be sufficient to discover it as an ambiguous object , if it were removed to the distance of the 88ogth order .
To investigate how far the 15th cluster , which is also visible to the eye , might be removed , so as still to be seen in the front view of the 2o feet telescope , we find , by inspecting the table in which the profundities are given , that the eye can reach it at the distance of the 243d order ; therefore this telescope , with a power 75.08 times that of the eye , would still be able to show it at the distance of the 18g44th order , and being a globular cluster , its appearance would be that of a small star with rather a large diameter .
MDcMOXVTII , 3 P As there are but few custers of stars that can be seen by the eye , the observations of their visibility in the finders of telescopes , and their appearance in them , are of eminent use in ascertaining the distance at which we can expect to see celestial objects in large telescopes ; when , therefore , a cluster of stars cannot be seen by the eye , its visibility in the finder must first of all be reduced to the standard of the eye .
I harve already noticed that the power of my finders to show stars , has generally been about four times that of the eye ; then , as they would show a star at the distance of the 48th order , a celestial object , situated at this distance , would require to be brought to one quarter of that distance to become visible to the eye .
The 2d cluster of the connoissance , for instance , was seen in a finder with the above mentioned power , and its profundity having been ascertained to be 243 , we may conclude that it would be visible to the eye , if it were only of the 60.75th order ; this being admitted , it will follow that the 2o feet telescope would still show this cluster of stars as an ambiguous object , if it were removed to the 456ist order ; and with a space-penetrating power of ig9.69 , the 4o feet telescope , by which it was also observed , would have shown this cluster under the semblance of a star that might be distinguished from others by having rather a larger diaeter , if it had been at the distance of the iti645th order .
In the foregoing instances , I ave assigned the extent of the poer to reach ceestial objects , ai is in te same instruments whiereby they were observed , but this is not a necessary conditon ; for wlet the vsibility , and the particu2 4,68 lar manner of its appearance of any cluster of stars in a finder or in a small telescope of any known gaging power is ascertained ; and when also by any superior instrument its profundity in space has been assigned , so that it may be reduced to the station at which it would be visibleto the eye , it may then be viewed with any telescope of which the space-penetrating power is known ; and if we put e for the power of the eye , f for that of the telescope which acts the part of the finder , p for the ascertained profundity of the cluster , and S for the space-penetrating power of a superior telescope , then will the extent E of this telescope to reach the same cluster , as an ambiguous object of any required appearance , be had by the formula E= e-S It will not be necessary to calculate , by this formula , the order of distances at which in large telescopes some of the clusters of stars would be seen like telescopic comets ; others as large stellar nebula3 , and others again as ill defined stars surrounded by nebulosity , as all these appearances must fall within the compass of the full stretch of their power ; I shall therefore only add a calculation of the ambiguous visibility of one of the very distant clusters of stars .
The 75th of the connoissance is not visible to the eye , but may be seen in the finder ; and the telescopic observations of it have ascertained its profundity to be of the 734th order ; the station to which it should be brought , that it might be visible to the eye , is therefore of the 183.5th order .
From this it follows , that with any telescope which has the spacepenetrating power of the front view of my so feet reflector , this cluster might still be perceived if it were removed to the distance of the i37o7th order ; and that the 40 feet telescope , which in this case would really act the part of a finder , would still show this cluster of stars as an ambiguous object at a profundity in space amounting to the 35175th order .
