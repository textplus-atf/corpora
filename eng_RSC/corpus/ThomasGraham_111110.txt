" Supplementary Observations on the Diffusion of Liquids .
" By Thomas Graham , Esq. , F.R.S. , F.C.S. The former experiments of the author furnished strong grounds for believing that isomorphous salts possess a similar diffusibility .
All the salts of potash and armmonia , which were compared , appear to be equi-diffusive ; so also were the salts of certain magnesian bases .
A single preliminary observation on the nitrates of lead and baryta , however , opposed the general conclusion , and demanded further inquiry .
It is scarcely necessary to say that any new means of recognizing the existence of the isomorphous relation between different substances , must prove highly valuable .
The investigation was also extended to several new substances , such as hydrocyanic acid , acetic acid , sulphurous acid , alcohol , ammonia and salts of organic bases , without reference to isomorphous relations .
Hydrogen Acids.-The period of diffusion arbitrarily chosen for these acids was five days .
The diffusate , or quantity of acid diffused , was determined by precipitating the liquid of the external reservoirs with nitrate of silver , and weighing the salt of silver formed .

67'68 9'00 Hydrochloric acid is the most highly diffusive substance hitherto observed ; it appears to exceed hydrate of potash at 53§§5 , as 7'56 to 6'12 , or as 100 to 80-9 .
The experiments indicate a similarity of diffusion between the isomorphous substances , hydrochloric and hydriodic acids , and hydrochloric and hydrobromic acids .

1658 100-18 Hydrobromic acid appears therefore to coincide in diffusibility with hydrochloric acid at this temperature .
It is remarked that these three acids , hydrochloric , hydrobromic and hydriodic , do not exhibit the same correspondence in another physical property , namely , the densities of their aqueous solutions containing the same proportion of acid .
The densities of 2 per cent. solutions of hydrochloric and hydriodic acids appear to be respectively 1-0104 and 1*0143 , at 60 ?
F. , and that of hydrobromic acid is an intermediate number .
The same acids are also known to differ considerably in the boiling-points of solutions containing the same proportion of acid .
A considerable diversity of physical properties appears here to be compatible with equal diffusibility in substances which are isomorphous .
The diffusion-time of bromine was made ten days , or double the time of hydrobromic acid .
Two cells contained together a diffusate of 5-80 grs. of bromine ; another two cells a diffusate of 5'88 grs. ; mean 5-84 grs. at 60 ?
01 F. ; or 6'76 grs. for a1 per cent. solution .
Doubling the last result , 13-52 grs. are obtained for a2 per cent. solution , which is still considerably under the diffusate of hydrobromic acid ( 16*58 grs. ) in half the time .
Hydrocyanic acid appeared less diffusive than hydrochloric acid , at the same temperature 59 ?
'7 , as 12'45 to 16%55 , or as 75'2 to 100 , and not to belong therefore to the same class of diffusive substances .
Nitric Acid.-Time of diffusion also five days .
The quantity of this acid diffused was determined with great exactness by neutralization by means of a normal solution of carbonate of soda .
The diffusion of the different proportions of this acid at one temperature is as follows .

57'92 7'86 The 2 per cent. solution is taken as the standard of comparison for the ratios , instead of the 1 per cent. solution , from the greater accuracy with which the diffusion of the former can be observed .
The usual approach to equality of diffusion , between chlorides and nitrates , is observable in hydrochloric and nitric acids , at least in the 1 and 2 per cent. solutions .
Sulphuric Acid.-The time of diffusion arbitrarily chosen for this and the three following acids was ten days .
The diffusate of this acid was determined in the same manner as that of nitric acid .
The diffusion of the different proportions of sulphuric acid is as follows .

68-96 8-16 The diffusibility of different strengths of this acid appears to be pretty uniform , but with a slight tendency to increase in the higher proportions , like hydrochloric acid .
Sulphuric acid is greatly inferior in velocity of diffusion to hydrochloric acid , but still appears to possess considerably more than half the diffusibility of the latter .
UCromic Acid.-The diffusate of the 2 per cent. solution was 22'43 grs. of chromic acid , in two cells , at 67 ?

The diffusion of sulphuric acid at 63 ?
'5 , was 19'73 grs. , which would give about 21 grs. of that acid at 67 ?

Acetic Acid.-This acid cannot be determined accurately by the acidimetrical method , owing to the acetates of potash and soda being essentially alkaline to test-paper , like the carbonates of the same bases , although neutral in composition .
The weight of carbonate of baryta dissolved by the acid was had recourse to .

It appears very similar to hydrocyanic acid at the same temperature ; or to possess about three-fourths of the diffusibility of hydrochloric acid .
Alcohol.-Time of diffusion ten days .
The quantity of alcohol diffused was determined by careful distillation .
The density of the alcohol solutions in the phials was always made to exceed that of the water in the jars , by the addition of chloride of sodium to the former .

8-62 74'9 The diffusion of alcohol approaches to one-half of that of sulphate of water at nearly the same temperature .
Alcohol may be substituted for water to dissolve certain salts , and at the same time be made an atmosphere into which these salts are allowed to diffuse .
From experiments which have been commenced on this subject , it appears that the diffusion of hydrate of potash , iodide of potassium , chloride of calcium and others is about four times slower into alcohol of density 0'840 than into water .
The salts likewise often exhibit the same relations in their diffusibility in alco98'4 hol , as in water , with some singular exceptions , such as chloride of mercury .
Nitrate of Baryta.-The time of diffusion of this and the two following nitrates was 1143 ` days .
The salt diffused was precipitated by sulphuric acid , and calculated from the weight of the sulphate of baryta formed .

This time is to that of sulphate of magnesia ( 16'166 days ) as the square root of 8 is to the square root of 16 ; but does not appear to express the true relation between these salts .

61*56 8'021 On comparing solutions of chloride of calcium and nitrate of lime , it appears that the correspondence between the 1 and 2 per cent. solutions is sufficiently close , but that in the 4 and 8 per cent. the salts diverge , as happens also with hydrochloric and nitric acids themselves .
The nitrate in both cases falls off , while the chloride sustains throughout the high diffusibility of the lower proportions .

6-06 93'08 Sesquichloride of Iron.-A series of observations was made upon the diffusion of the different proportions of this salt from 1 to 8 per cent. , but in all of them decomposition was determined by the diffusion , with turbidity also in the solution phial except in the 8 per cent. solution .
The mean diffusion from the 8 per cent. solution , at 63 ?
'3 , was 55'88 grs. of sesquichloride of iron , with 6'66 grs. of free hydrochloric acid , in two cells .
It appears from this that perchloride of iron approaches the chloride of calcium in diffusibility .
That the protoand persalts of the magnesian metals should have a similar rate of diffusion , is not unlikely from other analogies which they exhibit .
Sulphates of Magnesia and Zinc.-The time chosen for the diffusion of these salts , namely , 16'166 days , is a multiple by 2 of the time of sulphate of potash , and by 4 of the time of hydrate of potash .
The diffusate was evaporated to dryness and weighed .

101'42 2'560 It is remarked that the diffusion of these two isomorphous salts , sulphate of magnesia and sulphate of zinc , differs so much , in the 1 per cent. solution , as 8-75 per cent. This , however , is considered to be an accidental error , the disturbances from changes of temperature and other causes of dispersion being in direct proportion to the duration of the experiment , and therefore much increased with long times ; while the 1 per cent. solution also , from its low density , is the proportion most exposed to such errors .
The sulphate of zinc appears to be the truest throughout , in its diffusion , of these two salts .
The approach to equality becomes close in the 4 per cent. and larger proportions of salt , particularly with the unusually high proportions of 16 and 24 per cent. , which were observed in these salts .
The diffusion of both salts falls off remarkably in the higher proportions .
The result of the comparison of these two magnesian sulphates is no doubt favourable to the similarity of diffusion of isomorphous salts .

The times 5'71 and seven days chosen for the chloride of potassium and sodium , it will be observed , are as the square roots of 2 and 3 .
A certain deviation from this ratio of the times of equal diffusion , appears on comparing the experimental results obtained at present for these salts .

52*38 7'590 A remarkable approach to equality in the diffusion of the bicarbonates of potash and soda , in the times chosen , is observed equally in all the proportions of salt from 1 to 8 per cent. The times chosen for the bicarbonates of potash and ammonia is to that of the bicarbonate of soda , as the square root of 2 to the square root of 3 , and the remarkable agreement observed in the diffusion of these salts gives support therefore to that relation .
In alluding to this relation , it is , however , added that the carbonates of potash and soda deviate from it in a sensible degree , and the hydrates of potash and soda very considerably ; so that if the relation has a real foundation , it must be masked in the salts last named by differences existing between them in certain properties , the disco .

Hydrochlorates of Morphine and Strychnine.-Time of diffusion 11'43 days .
The quantity diffused was determined from the chlorine , which was precipitated as chloride of silver in an acid solution .
These two analogous salts appear to approach very closely in diffusibility .
