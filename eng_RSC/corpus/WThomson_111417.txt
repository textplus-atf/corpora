The motion of air in the neighbourhood of a body moving very slowly through it , may be approximately determined by treating the problem as if air were an incompressible fluid .
The ordinary hydrodynamical equations , so applied , give the velocity and the pressure of the fluid at any point ; and the variations of density and temperature actually experienced by the air are approximately determined by using the approximate evaluation of the pressure thus obtained .
Now , if a solid of any shape be carried uniformly through a perfect liquid* , it experiences fluid-pressure at different parts of its surface , expressed by the following formula , I-H K p( -q 2 ) , where II denotes the fluid-pressure at considerable distances from the solid , p the mass of unity of volume of the fluid , V the velocity of translation of the solid , and q the velocity of the fluid relatively to the solid , at the point of its surface in question .
The effect of this pressure on the whole is , no resultant force , and only a resultarnt couple which vanishes in certain cases , including all in which the solid is symmetrical with reference .
to the direction of motion .
If the surface of the body be everywhere convex , there will be an augmentation of pressure in the fore and after parts of it , and a diminution of pressure round a medium zone .
There are clearly in every such case just two points of the surface of the solid , one in the fore part , and the other in the after part , at which the velocity of the fluid relatively to it is zero , and which we may call the fore and after pole respectively .
The middle region round the body in which the relative velocity exceeds V , and where consequently the fluid pressure is diminished by the motion , may be called the equatorial zone ; and where there is a definite middle line , or line of maximum relative velocity , this line will be called the equator .
If the fluid be air instead of the ideal " perfect liquid , " and if the motion be slow enough to admit of the approximation referred to above , there will be a heating effect on the fore and after parts of the body , and a cooling effect on the equatorial zone .
If the dimensions and the thermal conductivity of the body be such that there is no sensible loss on these heating and cooling effects by conduction , the temperature maintained at any point of the surface by the air flowing against it , will be given by the equation '41 t= ( R ) where 0 denotes the temperature of the air as uninfluenced by the motion , and p and 1L denote the same as before .
Hence , using for p its value by the preceding equation , we have '41 t=e { + 2P(v_q2 ) } But if H denote the length of a column of homogeneous atmosphere , of which the weight is equal to the pressure on its perpendicular section , and if g denote the dynamical measure of the force of gravity ( 32'2 in feet per second of velocity generated per second ) , we have gpHl= II ; and if we denote by a the velocity of sound in the air , which is equal to V'1-41 xyH , the expression for the temperature becomes '41 = 1-41 V2--q }l'41 .
t=O 1+- .
~ According to the supposition on which our approximation depends , that the velocity of the motion is small , that is , as we now see , a small fraction of the velocity of sound , this expression becomes t=e i +-41X 2 At either the fore or after pole , or generally at every point where the velocity of the air relatively to the solid vanishes ( at a re-entrant * The temperatures are reckoned according to the absolute thermodynamic scale which we have proposed , and may , to a degree of accuracy correspondent with that of the ordinary " gaseous laws , " be taken as temperature Centigrade by the air-thermometer , with 273 ?

2 angle for instance , if there is such ) , we have q=o , and therefore an elevation of temperature amounting to Vs 41 x. If , for instance , the absolute temperature , 0 , of the air at a distance from the solid be 287 ?
( that is 55 ?
on the Fahr. scale ) , for which the velocity of sound is 1115 per second , the elevation of temperature at a pole , or at any point of no relative motion , will be , in degrees Centigrade , 580 ?
8x ( Y ) , or 580 ?
8x(1x 5 ) the velocity V being reckoned in feet per second .
If , for instance , the velocity of the body through the air be 88 feet per second ( 60 miles an hour ) , the elevation of temperature at the points of no relative motion is '36 ?
or rather more than r of a degree Centigrade .
To find the greatest depression of temperature in any case , it is necessary to take the form of the body into account .
If this be spherical , the absolute velocity of the fluid backwards across the equator will be half the velocity of the ball forwards ; or the relative velocity ( q ) of the fluid across the equator will be 3 of the velocity of the solid .
Hence the depression of temperature at the equator of a sphere moving slowly through the air will be just of the elevation of temperature at each pole .
It is obvious from this that a spheroid of revolution , moving in the direction of its axis , would experience at its equator a depression of temperature , greater if it be an oblate spheroid , or less if it be a prolate spheroid , than 9 of the elevation of temperature at each pole .
It must be borne in mind , that , besides the limitation to velocities of the body small in comparison with the velocity of sound , these conclusions involve the supposition that the relative motions of the different parts of the air are unresisted by mutual friction , a supposition which is not even approximately true in most cases that can come under observation .
Even in the case of a ball pendulum vibrating in air , Professor Stokes finds that the motion is seriously influenced * " On the Effect of the Internal Friction of Fluids on the Motion of Pendulums , " read to the Cambridge Philosophical Society , Dec. 9 , 1850 , and published in vol. ix .
part 2 of their Transactions .
by fluid friction .
Hence with velocities which could give any effect sensible on even the most delicate of the ether thermometers yet made ( 330 divisions to a degree ) , it is not to be expected that anything like a complete verification or even illustration of the preceding theory , involving the assumption of no friction , can be had .
It is probable that the forward polar region of heating effect will , in consequence of fluid friction , become gradually larger as the velocity is increased , until it spreads over the whole equatorial region , and does away with all cooling effects .
Our experimental inquiry has hitherto been chiefly directed to ascertain the law of the thermal effect upon a thermometer rapidly whirled in the air .
We have also made some experiments on the modifying effects of resisting envelopes , and on the temperatures at different parts of the surface of a whirled globe .
The whirling apparatus consisted of a wheel worked by hand , communicating rapid rotation to an axle , at the extremity of which an arm carrying the thermometer with its bulb outwards was fixed .
The distance between the centre of the axle and the thermometer bulb was in all the experiments 39 inches .
The thermometers made use of were filled with ether or chloroform , and had , the smaller 275 , and the larger 330 divisions to the degree Centigrade .
The lengths of the cylindrical bulbs were -9and l-A4 inch , their diameters '26 and *48 of an inch respectively .

It is however possible that the ftull thermal effect was not so completely attained in three minutes ( the time occupied by each whirling ) as with the smaller bulb .
On the whole it did not appear to us that the experiments justified the conclusion , that an increase of the dimensions of the bulb was accompanied by an alteration of the thermal effect .

-0095 The increased thermal effect at comparatively slow velocities , exhibited in the above Table , appeared to be owing to the friction of the air against the paper surface being greater than against the polished glass surface .
One quarter of the enveloping paper was now removed , and the bulb whirled with its bared part in the rear .

Another quarter of paper was now removed from the opposite side .
Then on whirling so that the bared parts were anterior and posterior , we obtained a rise of 83 divisions with a velocity of 93'8 .
But on turning the thermometer on its axis one qu , arter round , so that the bared parts were on each side , we found the somewhat smaller rise of 62 divisions for a velocity of 90 8 feet per second .
The effect of surface friction having been exhibited at slow velocities with the papered bulb , we were induced to try the effect of increasing it by wrapping iron wire round the bulb .

According to its intensity the On inspecting the above Table , it will be seen that the thermal effect produced at slow velocities was five times as great as with the bare bulb .
This increase is evidently due to friction .
In fact , as one layer of wire was employed , and the coils were not so close as to prevent the access of air between them , the surface must have been about four times as great as that of the uncovered bulb .
At high velocities , it is probable that a cushion of air which has not time to escape past resisting obstacles makes the actual friction almost independent of variations of surface , which leave the magnitude of the body unaltered .
In conformity with this observation , it will be seen that at high velocities the thermal effect was nearly reduced to the quantity observed with the uncovered bulb .
Similar remarks apply to the following results obtained after wrapping round the bulb a fine spiral of thin brass wire .

In each situation it was placed as near the glass globe as possible without actually touching it .
thermal effect must necessarily suffer diminution ; unless indeed it gives rise to increased resistance .

It is clear from these , that the air , after coming in contact with the front of the globe , traverses with friction the equatorial parts , giving out an accumulating thermal effect , a part of which is carried round to the after pole .
At higher velocities the effects of friction seem rapidly to diminish , so that at velocities between 23 and 38 feet per second , the mean indication of thermometers placed all round the globe would be nearly constant .
Our anticipation ( written before these latter experiments were made ) , that a complete verification of the theory propounded at the commencement was impossible with our present means , is thus completely justified .
It may be proper to observe , that in the form of experiment hitherto adopted by us , the results are probably , to a trifling extent , influenced by the vortex of air occasioned by the circular motion .
We have on several occasions noticed the effect of sudden changes in the force of wind on the temperature of a thermometer held in it .
Sometimes the thermometer was observed to rise , at other times to fall , when a gust came suddenly on .
When a rise occurred , it was seldom equivalent to the effect , as ascertained by the foregoing experiments , due to the increased velocity of the air .
Hence we draw the conclusion , that the actual temperature of a gust of wind is lower than that of the subsequent lull .
This is probably owing to the air in the latter case having had its vis viva converted into heat by collision with material objects .
In fact we find that in sheltered situations , such for instance as one or two inches above a wall opposite to the wind , the thermometer indicates a higher temperature than it does when exposed to the blast .
The question , which is one of great interest for meteorological science , has hitherto been only partially discussed by us , and for its complete solution will require a careful estimate of the temperature of the earth 's surface , of the effects of radiation , &amp;c. , and also a knowledge of the causes of gusts in different winds .
