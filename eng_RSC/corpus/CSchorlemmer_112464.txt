Di-lsopropyl , C , H , .
Iodide of isopropyl is not perceptibly acted upon by sodium even if the liquid is heated to the boiling-point ; but if anhydrous ether perfectly free from alcohol is added , a reaction soon commences without application of external heat ; the liquid becomes warm , and the iodide is decomposed with formationof iodide of sodium .
The chief products of this reaction are , ( 1 ) propylene , from which bromide of propylene was obtained by passing the gases which are evolved through bromine ; ( 2 ) a gaseous hydrocarbon , which is not absorbed by bromine and which burns with a luminous flame , probably consisting of hydride of propyl ; and ( 3 ) a liquid hydrocarbon , which , according to its composition and mode of formation , must be considered as di-isopropyl .
By the following method I obtained the largest yield of this liquid .
A flask holding about 250 cub. centims. was half filled with iodide of isopropyl ( which had been prepared by acting with hydroiodic acid upon glycerin ) ; an equivalent quantity of sodium cut into thin pieces was added , upon this a layer of pure ether was poured , and the flask quickly coinnected with the lower end of a Liebig 's condenser .
Where the two liquids meet , a brisk reaction soon sets in ; the escaping gases carry off a large e quantity of the liquid , chiefly of the more volatile ether , and it is therefore necessary to keep the condenser as cold as possible .
The reaction goes on generally quietly until the greatest portion of the iodide is decomposed ; if it stops after a short time , gentle heat has to be applied as long as gas is evolved .
After the reaction is over , the [ June 20 , 34 flask is heated in an1 oil-bath , and the liquid contents are distilled off .
The distillate is fractionated several times , and the portion boiling between 50 ?
and 700 C. collected separately .
This consists chiefly of di-isopropyl , but also contains ether , undecomposed iodide of isopropyl , and may also contain diallyl if the iodide was not quite pure .
In order to remove these admixtures , the liquid is repeatedly shaken with concentrated sulphuric acid as long as heat is evolved , then rectified , and the distillate treated with a mixture of strong nitric and sulphuric acid as long as iodine separates , then washed , dried , and rectified over potassium .
Di-isopropyl is a colourless mobile liquid , the odour of which cannot be distinguished from that of hydride of hexyl , and which boils constantly at 58 ?

Chlorine attacks this hydrocarbon very easily in the cold , and if the action is stopped before the whole has been acted upon , the principal substitution-product consists of the chloride C , HE13 Cl , a colourless liquid which boils constantly at 122 ?

No trace of a monochloride is formed ; the chief product consists of bichlorinated di-isopropyl , Co HI , C12 , a solid substance , besides a smaller quantity of high boiling products , which are very rich in chlorine .
From those the solid chloride may be easily separated either by distillation with water , the steam carrying the solid substance very easily over , or by cooling the mixture of the substitution-products and pressing the crystals which separate between blotting-paper .
This compound forms white crystals which smell strongly of camphor , and , exposed to the air , soon volatilize at the common temperature ; heated in an open tube they sublime below their fusingpoint ; in a closed tube they melt at about 160 ? .

; the quantity which I obtained was too small to attempt to separate them into definite products Di-isopropyl is slowly oxidized if it is heated with a concentrated solution of dichromate of potassium and sulphuric acid , a large quantity of carbonic acid being evolved .
In order to oxidize 10 grammes of the hydrocarbon it took a week ; the liquid was distilled off every day , and the slightly acid distillate neutralized with carbonate of sodium , and thus a sodilm-salt was obtained which on recrystallization gave a crop of crystals , whose habitus and reactions were found to coincide with acetate of sodium .
36 [ June 20 , The small quantity of mother-liquor from these crystals was precipitated with nitrate of silver , and the precipitate crystallized from boiling water .
0'2120 of this silver-salt gave 0'1374 of silver , or 64'72 per cent. ; acetate of silver contains 64*6 7 per cent. of silver .
By oxidizing di-isopropyl with chromic acid the only products formed are therefore carbonic acid and acetic acid .

Amyl-isopropyl , C8 H1 , .
This hydrocarbon was obtained by acting with sodium and ether upon a mixture of iodide of isopropyl and iodide of amyl .
The reaction sets in without applying heat , and is rather violent in the beginning , and it is therefore necessary to keep the flask first immersed in cold water ; but to complete the decomposition the mixture has to be heated .
When all the sodium has disappeared , the contents of the flask are distilled from an oilbath , and the distillate is heated with sodium as long as iodide of sodium is formed .
Ether and non-attacked iodides are then removed by treating the liquid with strong acids as described above , and thus a mixture of diisopropyl , amyl-isopropyl , and di-amyl is obtained , from which these hydrocarbons can easily be separated by fractional distillations .
Amyl-isopropyl is a colourless liquid boiling at 109-110 ?
; its specific gravity was found at 16 ?

Its C5 H11 boiling-point and its specific gravity coincide perfectly well with those of dibutyl , which according to Kopp boils at 109 ?
, and has at 16 ?

I believe that these two hydrocarbons are identical ; for Erlenmeyer stated a short time ago in a preliminary note , that he has found that the butyl-alcohol formed by fermentation is methyl-alcohol , in which one atom of hydrogen in the methyl is replaced by isopropyl , and that fermentation amyl-alcohol is ethyl-alcohol , in which also one atom of hydrogen in the methyl group is replaced by isopropylt .
If this view is correct , amyl-isopropyl must be identical with dibutyl , as the following formulae clearly show:* Ann. der Chem. und Pharm. vol. xcv .

23-90 per cent. Cl. 23-9 per cent. Cl. When chlorine acts upon amyl-isopropyl , a mixture of chlorine substitution-products is formed , from which I did not succeed in obtaining definite compounds .
On repeated fractional distillation the largest portion passes over between 1700 and 1800 as a colourless liquid smelling of oranges .
0-2815 of this substance gave on analysis 0-2772 of chloride of silver , which corresponds to 24-36 per .
cent. of chlorine .
This liquid appears therefore to be a mixture of isomreric chlorides of the formula C8 II,7 C1 .
A solution of chromic acid attacks amyl-isopropyl very slowly ; the only oxidation-products which are formed are carbonic acid and acetic acid , from which latter the sodium-salt was prepared , and this was converted into the silver-salt .
0-1985 of this silver-salt contained 0-1291 of silver , or 65-0 per cent. , whilst acetate of silver contained 64-67 per cent. From the commencement of my researches on the hydrocarbons of this series I have tried to obtain definite and characteristic oxidation-products ; but the results of these experiments are as yet but very incomplete .
I have chiefly studied the action of oxidizing agents upon hydride of hexyl .
This hydrocarbon is acted upon by a concentrated solution of chromic acid in the same manner as the two hydrocarbons described above ; the only products formed are carbonic acid and acetic acid .
A mixture of manganic peroxide and sulphuric acid , as well as a solution of permanganic acid , give only carbonic acid .
Nitric acid also forms carbonic acid by boiling it or heating it in sealed tubes with hydride of hexyl ; besides , a small quantity of a solid acid , very likely belonging to the oxalic-acid series , is produced .
have not yet obtained this body in sufficient quantity , as it is only very slowly formed .
I hope , however , to find a method to produce it in larger quantities , and also to obtain characteristic oxidation-products of the different hydrocarbons .
