V. On the length of the French Metre estimated in parts of the English standard .
By Captain Henry Kater , F. R. S. Read February 5 , r818 .
ONE of the objects of the committee of the Royal Society appointed for the purpose of determining the length of the seconds pendulum , being the comparison of the French metre with the British standard measure , two metres were procured from Paris for that purpose , the one made in the usual manner and called the metre a bouts , and the other a bar of platina on which the length of the m6tre is shown by two very fine lines ; this is named the inetre a traits .
The width of the melre a bouts is one inch , and its thickness 0,3 of an inch .
On one side the word " METRE " is engraved , and on the other " FORTIN a PARIS .
" The terminating planes are supposed to be perfectly parallel , and the distance between them is the length of the metre .
The metre a traits is the same width as the metre a bouts , but only a quarter of an inch thick .
The lines expressing the length of the metre are so fine that one of them is scarcely perceptible even with the assistance of a microscope , unless the light be very favourable .
The situation of the lines may however be discovered by two strong black dots made with a graver at the extremities of each , and a fine line crosses them at right angles to indicate the parts from which the measurements are to be taken .
This metre previous to being brought from Paris , was compared with a standard m6tre by M. ARAGO , with all that care and ability which he isso well known to possess , and which so delicate an operation requires .
The result was , that the distance between thelines was found to be less than a metre by , 7 , .
of a mllirntre or,00069 of an inch .
The same micrometer microscopes were usedfin the comparisons which I am about to detail , as have been already described in my account of ' experiments on the length of the pendulum , in the Philosophical Transactions of the present year , and as the length of the m itre is nearly 39,4 inches , I was enabled to refer it to the same divisions of Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH'S scale as I had employed in the measurement of the pendulum .
I commenced with the metre a traits .
It was placed in contact with the standard scale , their surfaces being in the same plane .
An excellent thermometer was laid upon the scale , and a piece of thick leather was placed upn its bulb in order to prevent its being affected by heat from the person of the observer , The whole was suffered to remain in this state for two or three days , after which the following observations were made at various times , the microscopes being brought alternately over the mrtre and the scale .
The value of each division of the micrometer is , of an inch* .

SHUCKBURGH'S scale is -J 39,37076 The comparison of the mdtre a bouts , presented considerable difficulties , which I conceive it would be of little use to detail , as the necessity of comparisons of this kind is of very rare occurrence ; I shall therefore proceed to describe the method which was at last found successful .
Four rectangular pieces of brass were prepared precisely similar to those described in the account of experiments on the pendulum in the Philosophical Transactions before referred to .
These were marked C , c , D and d. The perfectly plane rectangular edges of the pieces C and c , being placed in contact , and kept thus by means of a spring , the distance of the fine lines drawn on their surfaces , parallel and very near to the rectangular edges , was found to be 500,5 divisions of the micrometer , and the pieces D and d being placed in like manner in contact , the distance of the lines on their surfaces estimated in the same divisions was 4456,7 .
The -metre a bouts being placed by the side of the brass scale and in contact with it , the pieces D and d : were applied to its extremities , the surfaces of the brass pieces being a little below the surface of the metre in order to preclude any error which might have arisen from the edges of the mnetre projecting beyond its terminating planes .
Each of the brass pieces was supported in this position upon a piece of lead of a sufficient thickness , and kept in close contact with the end of the metre by means of a slight spring bearing against a pin driven perpendicularly into the lead .
In order to ensure a perfect contact between each brass piece and the terminating plane of the metre , a flat ruler of brass was laid upon the surface of the metre so as to project beyond its extremity , and the end of the lead was elevated or depressed so that the line of light seen between the piece of brass and : the ruler , the eye being level with the surface of the brass , appeared to be equal in every part , when it was i-nfrred that the surfaces of the metre and , of the piece of brass were parallel , and consequently that their rectangular ends were perf-ctly in contact .
The distance between the lines on D and d was now taken by the microscoes , and transferred to the scale in the manner before described ; and when a sufficient number of comparisons had thus been made , the pieces D and d , were exchanged for those marked C and c , and the observations repeated with every precaution to ensure an accurate result , especially with respect to temperature .
The under surface of the mitre was then placed uppermost , and the apparats being arranged as befre , the same process was pursued as that which has just been described .
The results are contained in the following tables .

SHUCK- ) 39,370 BURGH'S scale 3937 The following is the manner in which the correction for temperature was obtained .
The expansion of platina according to the experiments of BORDA and others , is , oooo04,76 parts of its length for one degree of FAHRENHEIT , and as this is the expansion used by the French in adjusting the length of their metre , it must be employed on the present occasion .
The metre being taken at 3$o , the expansion for the difference between this and the temperature of measurement , must be subtracted from .
the apparent length of the metre .
The English standard temperature is 620 , therefore if the temperature of measurement be under this , the expansion of the scale for such difference of temperature must be deducted from the length of the metre before obtained .
These two corrections are combined in the column entitled ' correction for temperature .
" Sir G. SHUCKBURGH'S standard scale is of cast brass , and as I ' could not conveniently deter .
mine its actual expansion with that degree of accuracy that would have satisfied me , I have taken for it , the mean result of two experiments made on plate brass , which gave me an expansion of , ooooiol parts of its length for one degree of FAHRENHEIT .
The mean of most of the experiments made on the expansion of brass gives , oooo1o4 , and had Iemployed this last number instead of my own , the difference in the length of the metre would have been utterly inconsiderable .
Supposing then both metres to be of equal authority , we have for the length of the metre a traits 39,37076 , and for that of the metre d bouts 39,37081 inches ; the mean of which , 39,37079 , may be taken for the length of the metre in inches of Sir G. SHUCKBURGH'S standard scale when each is brought to its proper temperature.* ^ The length of the metre compared with BIRD 's parliamentary standard is , 39,37O62 inches .
