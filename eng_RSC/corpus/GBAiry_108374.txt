On the Laws of Individual Tides at Southampton and at Ipswich .
By G. B. AIRY , Esq. , :IlA .
, F.R.S. , Astronomer Royal .
Received February 16 , -Read March 2 , 1843 .
WITH the view of verifying the reported peculiarity in the tides at Southampton , I had proposed in the month of February 1842 to proceed thither for the purpose of examining , with my own eyes , the rise and fall of the water during one or more tides .
As soon , however , as my purpose was made known to Colonel COLBY , R.E. , Director of the Trigonometrical Survey , and to Lieutenant YOLLAND , R.E. , the Resident Officer at the Ordnance Map Office , Southampton , I received from those gentlemen the offer of placing at my service , for these observations , non-commissioned officers and privates of the corps of Royal Sappers and Miners , as well as of preparing and fixing the vertical scale of feet and inches , and of keeping a watch upon the general accuracy of the observed times .
I was extremely glad to avail myself of this offer , for I believe that a more intelligent and faithful body of men does not exist than the Sappers employed in the Trigonometrical Survey ; and I knew well the advantage of employing , upon a tedious business like this , a set of regular-service men stationed on the spot .
A vertical scale of deal laths , upon which the divisions and figures were branded , was fixed near the end of the pier at Southampton , very near to the landing-stairs on the north side of the pier , so that the divisions could at all stages of the tide ( with the assistance of a lantern at night ) be easily read by a person standing on the stairs .
The order of the graduations of the scale was increasing from the bottom upwards , and the zero of the scale was found , by levelling , to bear the following relation to certain fixed marks:[The mark in each case , except that of St. Paul 's Church , is a horizontal cut , indicated by the point of an arrow .
The arrow is on one side of the mark at Holyrood Church , and below each of the others .

87-449 The height of the water upon this scale was observed at every five minutes , from February 23 , 15b 10m ( astronomical reckoning ) , to February 27 , 6h 20m .
The watch by which the times were taken was a pocket chronometer belonging to Lieutenant YOLLAND , of which the error was small .
The observations at February 24 , 6h 5m and 6h 10 " , were omitted from inadvertence ( darkness coming on before proper preparations were made ) ; those of February 24 , 6 " 35m and 611 40m , were excluded from calculation , because the water was disturbed by a boat ; and those of February 25 , 2"h Om , 2h 5m , and 2h 10m , because they were evidently irregular , although no reason was assigned for their irregularity .
When the seven complete tides embraced by these observations were laid down in graphlical projection , each of them presented a curve similar in its general form to the extraordinary figure represented in the diagram , fig. 1 .
in Plate II .
; four of the curves having three maxima of elevation in each tide .
In the first two tides , the first maximum , as in the diagram fig. 1 , was rather a stand-still in the rise than a rise and fall ; and in the last tide ( the highest of all ) , the first and third maxima were both of this character .
In all the others , the three maxima to each tide were well marked .
On February 2 : from 15h to 17h , the wind blew strong from W. and S.W. On February 25 , from 18h to 19h , it blew a gale from S.W. and W. From February 25 , 21h , to February 26 , 3h , the wind was strong from S.W. and W. And from February 26 , 20h to 23h , there was a strong W.S.W. wind .
At other times the air was almost perfectly calm .
These changes in the state of the atmosphere do not appear to have produced any sensible alteration in the character of the individual tides .
The epochs and magnitudes of the tides appear , however , to have been sensibly altered by these or other disturbing causes .
Thus , if we examine the times and intervals of high water , they are as follows:46 h m February 23 ... 22 5h m.a Interval. .

16 324 The irregularities here are considerable , and , taken in conjunction with those of the times of low water , they seem to show that some powerful disturbing cause has affected the low water at February 25 , 17h 50m .
Nevertheless , the tidal curves for the tides on both sides of that low water are undistinguishable , as viewed by the eye , from the rest ; and in the grouping for the reductions , to be shortly explained , the nunibers furnished by them do not differ sensibly from those given by the others .
Considering it then as established that the peculiarities in these tidal curves are the representatives of real peculiarities in the tides at Southampton ( such as may always be expected in every individual tide of nearly the same magnitude as those observed on this occasion ) , and in no degree due to the accidental circumstances of weather ; and considering also that these tides exhibit no certain trace of diurnal tide ; I shall proceed to explain the method by which they have been reduced into mathematical form .
The method is , in many respects , similar to that which I used for the Deptford tides , in a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1842 .
The first step was , to divide the whole series of observations into groups , each group representing one tide .
This was done by taking the interval from low water to low water as one tide , and supposing it to correspond to 360 ?
of phase , and converting the interval between every observation in that tide and its commencement into phase , by that proportion .
The next step was to reduce the different observations of height to one uniform scale .
This was done by assuming every range of tide , from high water to low water or from low water to high water , to be represented by 2 , and converting the depression of the water at every observation below the high water of that tide into abstract number , by that proportion .
In this manner every observation gave a phase expressed in degrees , and a converted depression expressed in abstract number .
The next step was to collect from all the tides the phases between 0 ?
and 5 ?
and their 48 corresponding converted depressions , and to take their mean ; then those between 5 ?
and 10 ?
; and so on .
The phases thus obtained differed little from 2 ?
05 , 70 ?
5 , &amp;c. ; and the correction of converted depression for these small differences being easily found from the preceding and following numbers , the converted depressions for 2 ?
-5 , 7 ?
'5 , &amp;c. were found .
In this manner the following Table was formed : Corresponding phases and converted depressions in the Southampton Tides ; the phase commencing with low wrater and increasing by 360 ?
in one tide ; and the depression being measured from high water , the whole range being called 2-000 .

has been constructed .
To express these numbers in a mathematical form by means of a periodic function , it was assumed that the converted depression could be represented by the formula A+ B. sin phase + C. sin 2 phase + D. sin 3 phase + E. sin 4 phase , + b. cos phase + c. cos 2 phase + d. cos 3 phase + e. cos 4 phase .
Then A is the mean of all the converted depressions .
B is found by multiplying every converted depression by its value of sin phase , and dividing the sum of all the products by 36 .
b is found in the same way , using the values of cos phase as factors .
C is found by using sin 2 phase as factor , &amp;c. In this manner the following expression was found for the converted depression:0'900 + 0'469 .
sin phase 0085 .
sin 2 phase 0'057 .
sin 3 phase0'017 sin 4 phase + 0'766 .
cos phase + 0'174 .
cos2 phase +0 182 .
cos 3 phase 0'029 .
cos 4 phase ; or 0'900 + 0'898 .

The theory of waves , so far as it has yet gone , fails to explain the form of this expression .
It is not reconcileable with that obtained on the supposition that the extent of vertical oscillation bears a sensible proportion to the depth , either when the length of the channel is indefinite , or when the channel is interrupted by a barrier* .
The latter supposition is that which would seem to represent most exactly the circumstances of Southampton .
It is to be remarked , however , that the investigations which I have cited suppose the section of the channel to be rectangular ; a supposition which accords little with the state of the channel of the Southampton water , as shown by the extensive banks of mud discovered at low water there .
The investigations also exclude friction .
The following consideration is suggested by the form of the expression at which we have arrived for the converted depression .
If the tide were such as we suppose the sea-tide to be ( that is , if its depression were expressed by a single sine or cosine ) , and if ( as above ) the phase were measured from low water , then the converted depression would be expressed by A ' + B ' cos phase , or A ' + B ' sin ( phase + 90 ?
) .
From this we might be led to conceive that in all cases the argument of the principal term expressing the depression would be ( phase + 90 ?
) , the phase being a quantity which commences from low water .
But we find that it does in this instance depend on ( phase + 580 30 ' ) , or on ( phase + 900 31 ? ?
30 ' ) , differing from the former by 31 ? ?
30 ' , which corresponds to one hour of time nearly .
Now there seems to be no reason ( except the convenience of mariners ) why cotidal lines and speculations on the progress of the tide should be connected with high water rather than with low water , or any other phase of tide ; the only thing with which , in a scientific view , they can properly be connected ( as it appears to me ) , is the epoch of the argument of the principal term in the formula for depression .
But , in the instance of Southampton , the time of actual low water differs from the time of greatest depression given by that term , by one hour ; the times of high water differ about forty minutes .
If then the peculiarity of the Southampton tide has been created in part by the shallowness of the English channel , and exists on the coast ( we have no accurate information whether this is true or not ) , then the position of the cotidal line determined by the high water is erroneous , with reference to the views above mentioned , to a considerable extent .
Another consideration suggested by the same expression is this .
The mean of the depressions at high-water and at low-water is 1-000 .
But the constant term which enters into the general formula for the depression is 0'900 .
Now I conceive the latter to be the number which truly represents the mean level of the water .
In all cases , therefore , in which the mean level of the sea in different places is compared , I conceive it is not sufficient to take the mean of high and low water , but it is necessary to express the depression by the formula A+B sin phase +b cos phase +C sin 2 phase + &amp;c. , and to adopt the constant A as determining the mean level .
The difference , at Southampton , is about nine inches , by which quantity the mean level , as defined above , is higher than the mean of high and low waters .
The singularity of the results obtained at Southampton induced me to take measures for observing the tides in another estuary ; and for this purpose I selected Ipswich as a good station .
The positions of these places are not exactly similar : Southampton is nearly at the head of its gulf ; Ipswich may be considered as being absolutely at the head of its gulf .
The length of the Orwell does not differ materially from that of the Southampton water ; and in depth , breadth , magnitude of tide , &amp;c. , it resembles it closely .
Nevertheless , it will appear from the following results that the laws of the tides at these two places are extremely different .
An application made by me to CHARLES MAY , Esq. of Ipswich , was by him laid before the Dock Committee ; and I received from that body a most courteous offer of every assistance which could be required for the observation of the tides .
The immediate superintendence of the observations was undertaken by JAMES JONES , Esq. , Dockmaster ; and to the talent and spirit with which this gentleman undertook the troublesome business , I am entirely indebted for the opportunity of presenting the Royal Society with trustworthy results .
The observations commenced on 1842 , May 24 , 2311 40m ( astronomical reckoning ) , and finished on May 27 , 3h 35m ; embracing four complete tides .
The height of the water was observed at every five minutes .
The zero of the scale is the Lock Sill .
Great attention was given to the determination of time .
No irregularity appears on the face of the observations except about May 25 , 19h , after a heavy squall from the S.S.E. with violent rain .

The first three terms of this expression are extremely similar to those in the expression for the Southampton tide : the principal difference between the two expressions is in the fourth term , or that depending on 3 p. It is very remarkable that the algebraical difference between the formulae for tides which are so strikingly different in general character , depends entirely on a term of the third order of the fraction expressing the proportion of the vertical oscillaton to the pderth o the tiwater ; an order to which ( so far as I am aware ) theory has reached only in one instance , namely that of a wave travelling along an unlimited canal , and then only on the restricted suppositions of rectangular section and absence of frictionx .
It is also worthy of remark , that the terms of the second order .
( o not agree with those given by the restricted theory to which I have alluded , and that they differ materially from those given by the Deptford tidest .
From a consideration of the discordance between the observations and the present state of theory in regard to the form of these terms , as well as from remarking the influence which they have upon cotidal lines and mean levels , I am inclined to fix upon the circumstances of waves in canals as more deserving of notice at the present time , both in theory and in observation , than almost any other branch of the theory of tides .
I take this opportunity of correcting an error in my paper on the Deptford tides+ .
I have there stated , on the authority of Mr. WHEWELL ?
, that the age of the tide as inferred from the heights is greater than its age as inferred from the times .
This , however , is incorrect .
The age inferred from the heights is , in every instance that has been properly examined , less than that inferred from the times 11 .
I trust that , in a sulbject which is at first examination very confusing , it will be regarded as a venial fault to have erred in such company as that of Mr. WHEWELL .
In a theoretical view , this correction is very important .
The cause assigned for the greater age inferred from the heights is certain , as it is one given by observations which ( here according with theory ) show that the rise of tide occupies a shorter time at springs than at neaps .
Some other cause must therefore exist , of such a kind as to make the tide later in springs than in neaps , and of such a magnitude as completely to overrule that already assigned .
I conceive that this cause may be the increased range of the tide in horizontal extent up the river , at springs ; by which the tide is changed from a gulf-tide to a continuous-canal-tide , which travels more slowly .
But without more rigorous theory , I dare not pronounce upon this point .
