It will be seen hereafter , that for any one of the terms whose union com(8 ) 1dA .
poses L , &amp;c. , a ' is greater thanA , and that it may , on the mean of values , be said to differ little from -12 A. This reduces the ratio of the terms to 400 : 1 .
Now though we cannot assert that the sum of one set of terms will have to the sum of the other set of terms a ratio at all similar to this , yet the great disproportion of the terms related to each other seems sufficiently to dR justify us in the a priori assertion that the terms depending on d , t , are not dR worth calculating .
It will readily be seen that the terms depending on -ej are dR still more insignificant than those depending on d-d 32 .
We stated in ( 1 ) that the variations of the elements would be sufficiently taken into account in the expression for R if we put E+Ft for e , &amp;c. ; which amounts to taking only the secular variations .
There will be no difficulty in doing this for e , e , w ' , ,f , and 0 : but if such terms existed in the approximate dR dR expressions for a ' and a , they would require the use of the differentials d ' But a ' and a have no secular variations : and therefore these differentials are not wanted .
We may therefore proceed at once with the numerical calcula(8 ) ( 9 ) tion of the terms L , L &amp;c. SECTION 12 .

At that time I developed the principal fraction in a different manner , and I expressed the quantities C( &amp;c. by different formulae ; and the fundamental number differed by a few units in the last place of decimals .
The numbers admitted of comparison at several intermediate points before arriving at the final results ; and one small error was discovered in the old calculations , and one in the new ones .
Upon the whole , I am certain that there is no error of importance in these numbers ; and I think it highly probable that there is no error , except such as inevitably arise from the rejection of figures beyond a certain place of decimals .
It is impossible to assert that the last figure preserved is correct , or even the last but one ; but 1 do not think that the last but two is wrong .

It is prudent therefore , as well as interesting , to take into account these variations .

Let P and Q be the values of the coefficients of cos { 13 ( n't + ' ) 8 ( nt + s ) } and sin { 13 ( n't + W ' ) 8 ( n t+ s ) } in the expression above , giving to the elements the values which they had in 1750 .
Then , as all the permanent variations are small , the powers of t above the first may be rejected , and the coefficients at the time t after 1750 may be represented by P+ pt and Q+q t. Thus the term of R becomes ( P+pt ) cos { 13 ( n't+s ) 8 ( n t+s ) } +(Q+qt ) sin { 13 ( n't+$ ' ) 8 ( nt+s ) } ; dR dR and by ( 2 ) , omitting the terms depending on d , and for the reasons in ( 31 ) , d n ' 39 nt " a1 d -t , ( P+p t)sin { 13 ( n ' t +')-8 ( n t + ) } 39 nO"a ' + ( Q+qt)cos{13(n ' t+')-8(nt+s ) } d ~r 39 n " are d+ PI I ( Pt+pt2 ) sin{13( n't + ' ) -8 ( ntt + ) } 39 nt " a , ' ( Q t+q t2 ) cos { 13 ( n t+ s ' ) 8 ( n t+ s ) } Integrating these , ( considering n ' , e ' , n , and s , on the right-hand side , as constants , ) and substituting in the expression n ' t+ ' , it becomes N't +E +9 n { ( a{ P13 pn8 }s 13 t )-8 ( nt r(13 l8 n)2 s n13 nt'n ) } 106 39n'2a ?

To give them the form necessary for our purpose , we must from the variation in a Julian year deduce the variation for a unit of time .
Now a Julian year is ( nearly ) the time in which the angle n't increases by 2 ?
r ; its expression nl is therefore -n- , Consequently if we multiply the annual variations by 5- , we ni t shall have the variations in a unit of time : and if we multiply them by -r , we shall have the variations in the time t. With regard to the quantities p ' , &amp;c. introduced by LAPLACE for the purpose of altering his assumed masses if necessary , it may be observed that the only planet which materially affects the changes of the elements , and whose mass is known with certainty to require a change , is Venus herself .
The investigations of BURCKHARDT and BESSEL lead to the same conclusion as my own ( Phil. Trans. 1828 ) , namely , that the mass 81 of Venus is 9X the mass assumed by DELAMBRE , or 401211 of the sun 's mass .
1+ pJ LAPLACE supposed it 33+lS7 of the sun 's mass : the comparison of these gives LAPLACE'S 5/ =,045 .
In using LAPLACE'S expressions , therefore , I shall suppose =,045 , and p , L " , pt " , &amp;c. = 0 .

63 .
If we compare the first fraction with the fraction developed in Section 8 , we perceive that the following are the only differences between them .
The signs of the coefficients are different : and in the coefficient of the new fraction ( and in every term of its development ) there is p ' instead off , with the corresponding change of argumment .
Fromn this it is readily seen that the coefficient of cos ( 13 8 ) will be formed from that in Section 8 ( Art .

If we compare the second fraction with the fraction developed in Section 10 , we see that there are the same differences as those mentioned above , with this additional one , that the multiplier is double of the multiplier of the fraction in Section 10 .

The inequalities in the radii vectores are not sensible .
The long inequalities in the epoch of longitude are however by no means to be neglected .
To point out a single instance in which their importance will be sensible , I will estimate roughly their effect on the places of the Earth and Venus at the next transit of Venus over the Sun 's disk ( in 1874 ) .
The value of these inequalities at the time of BRADLEY'S observations was small ; and they were at their maximum at the beginning of this century .
If , then , the mean motions of the Earth and Venus were determined by comparing the observations about BRADLEY'S time with the observations a few years ago ; the Earth 's longitude in 1874 , when the inequalities are nearly vanishing , would be too small by nearly 4 " ; that of Venus would be too great by 6 " : their difference of longitude would therefore be nearly 10 " in error ; and this would produce on the geocentric* longitude of Venus an effect of between 20 " and 30 " .
As another instance , I may mention that the secular motions of the Earth , determined from observations of two consecutive centuries , would differ nearly 8 " , and those of Venus nearly 12 " .
These inequalities vanish in the years 1622 , 1742 , and 1861 ; and have their greatest values , positive for the Earth and negative for Venus , in 1682 ; and negative for the Earth and positive for Venus , in 1802 .
At the principal transits of Venus their values are as follows : and the differences between these are almost exactly proportional to the times .
They show that the secular motion ought to be increased by 4",8 ( the precession being supposed the same as in the application of MASKELYNE'S catalogue ) ; and then the application of the inequality investigated in this memoir will give correctly the Sun 's rmean longitude .
It appears , however , that the inequality in the motion of the perihelion given by this investigation , will not account for the anomalies in the place of the perihelion given in my paper referred to above .
Thus terminates one of the most laborious investigations that has yet been made in the Planetary Theory .
The term in question is a striking instance of the importance to which terms , apparently the most insignificant , may sometimes rise ; and the following remark will show the magnitude of the errors which might , under other circumstances , have arisen from the neglect of this term .
If the perihelia of Venus and the Earth had opposite longitudes , and if the line of nodes coincided with the major axes , the excentricities and inclination having the same values as at present , the coefficient of the inequality in the epoch would be 8",9 ; and all the other terms would be important .
A very small increase of the excentricities and inclination would double or treble these inequalities .
I have avoided any discussion of physical theory , as little can be added at present to what has been done by LAPLACE and others .
I may remark , however , that my expression for d differs from that given by LAPLACE ; and that the difference produces no effect in the ultimate result , because LAPLACE usesfn dt where I have used n t. On this point I have only to state that , by adopting the expression which I have used , every formula for the longitude , the radius vector , and the velocity in any direction , is exactly the same in form for the variable ellipse as for an invariable ellipse ( taking the variable elements instead of constant ones ) .
If the disturbing force should at any instant cease , my value of s for that instant would be the true value of the epoch of mean longitude in the orbit which the planet would proceed to describe .
It is precisely the object of using the method of variation of elen2 123 &amp; C. ments , to obtain expressions which possess these properties ; and therefore I have little doubt that my form will be recognised as more completely in accordance with the principles of that method than LAPLACE'S .
I should not in the present instance have raised a question on this point , but that I conceive the method of variation of elements , or some similar method , possessing the same advantages of simplicity of application and unlimited accuracy as to the order of the disturbing force , will ere long be adopted in the Planetary Theories , to the total exclusion of other methods .
With this expectation , it appears important to adhere closely to the principles of the theory in every formula that is derived from it .
I believe that the paper now presented to the Royal Society contains the first* specific improvement in the Solar Tables made in this country since the establishment of the Theory of Gravitation .
And I have great pleasure in reflecting that , after having announced a difficulty detected by observation , I have been able to offer an explanation on the grounds of physical theory .
POSTSCRIPT .
In estimating the variation of the elements of the orbit of Venus , the change of longitude of perihelion was supposed to be the same as the sidereal motion of the perihelion .
This is not strictly true ; as the longitude of the perihelion , measured as in Art .
4 , depends upon the place of the node , and is affected therefore by the motion of the node as well as by the motion of the perihelion .
The amount of the error is however perfectly insignificant .

On an inequality of long period in the motions of the Earth and Venus .

IN a paper " On the corrections of the elements of DELAMBRE'S Solar Tables , " published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1828 , I stated that the comparison of the corrections in the epochs of the sun and the sun 's perigee given by late observations , with the corrections given by the observations of the last century , appeared to indicate the existence of some inequality not included in the arguments of those Tables .
As soon as I had convinced myself of the necessity of seeking for some inequality of long period , I commenced an examination of the mean motions of the planets , with the view of finding one whose ratio to the mean motion of the earth could be expressed very nearly by a proportion whose terms were small : and I did not long seek in vain .
It is well known that the appearances of Venus recur in very nearly the same order every eight years : and therefore some multiple of the periodic time of Venus is nearly equal to eight years .
It is easily seen that this multiple is thirteen : and consequently eight times the mean motion of Venus is nearly equal to thirteen times the mean motion of the Earth .
According to LAPLACE , ( Mec .

) the mean annual motion of Venus is 650g*198 ; that of the Earth 399g*993 .
Hence 8X mean annual motion of Venus ... .= 5201584 13 X mean annual motion of the Earth. .
5199 '909 Difference ... ... .
=1 675 The difference is about , of the mean annual motion of the Earth ; and it implies the existence of an inequality whose period is about 240 years .
No term has .
yet been calculated whose period is so long with respect to the periodic time of the planets disturbed x. The probability that there would be found some sensible irregularity depending on this term , may be estimated from this consideration ; that .
in integrating the differential equations , this term receives a multiplier of 3X 13 X ( 240)2 , or about 2,200,000 .
On the other hand , the coefficient of this term is of the fifth order ( with regard to the excentricities and inclinations of the orbits ) .
The excentricities of both orbits are small .
And it is remarkable that in the present position of the perihelia , the terms which would otherwise produce a large inequality destroy each other almost exactly .
The inclination however is not so small ; and upon this the existing inequality depends principally for its magnitude .
The value of the principal term , calculated from the theory , I gave in a postscript to the paper above cited .
I propose in the present memoir to give an account of the method of calculation , and to include other terms which are necessarily connected with the principal inequality .
PART I. PERTURBATION OF THE EARTH'S LONGITUDE AND RADIUS VECTOR , SECTION 1 .
MJethod adoptedfor this investigation .
1 .
The motion of a disturbed planet may be represented by supposing it to move , according to the laws of undisturbed motion , in an ellipse whose dimensions , and position are continually changing : the epoch of the planet 's mean longitude at the origin of the time being also supposed to change .
Putting a for the semi-axis major ; e for the excentricity ; z for the longitude of perihelion ; n for the mean motion in longitude in a unit of time ; s for the epoch , or the mean longitude when t= 0 ; ( all which are variable ) : m for the mass of the planet ( Venus ) ; p for the sum of the masses of the sun and planet ; and the same letters with accents for the same quantities relative to another planet ( the * The period of the long inequality of Saturn is only about thirty times as great as the periodic time of Saturn .
Earth ) ; the variation of the elements of the second planet 's orbit will be given by the following equations : da ' n'a 'd dR dt =-/ '-d dn ' 3 nt2 a ' dR dt d cdI-= -re ( 1et2 ) del de 3n/ 2a dR Qnta2 dR n at dR d ^^~ 't Jr *d ed --e2)-(1 2 ) ' ) dem ( xx +ify ) m where R or expanded in ( x+y + V{( )+ ( y )+ ( z ' z ) } is expanded in terms depending on the mean motions of the two planets .
These expressions are true only on the supposition that the actual orbit of m ' is in the plane of xy , or is so little inclined that the square of the inclination may be neglected .
The values of a ' , e ' , &amp;c. on the right-hand side of the equations ought in strictness to be the true variable values .
But it will in general be sufficiently accurate to put for e ' the value E which it had near the time for which the investigation is made , and to consider it as constant : or at any rate the expression E+F t , where F is the mean value of its increase when t= 0 : and similarly dd de ' for the others .
Determining thus the values of j d ; , &amp;c. and from them those of a ' , e , &amp;c. , they are to be substituted in the expressions r= ' 1+ e2 + ( -e'+ + e'3 &amp;c. ) cos ( nt + ' ) + ( e'2+ &amp;c. )cos ( 2n't+ 2 s ' -2 ' ) + &amp;c. v'=n't+ '+ ( 2 e'e'3 + &amp;c. ) sin ( n ' + '-^ )+( e2 e4 + &amp;c. ) sin(2 n't +2 '-2 ' ) + &amp;c. and the true values of the radius vector and longitude are obtained .
69 When ( as in the present instance ) the inequality is so small that we may be satisfied with the principal part of it , we may in the expressions omit the powers of e ' .

Let 0 be the longitude of the node of the orbit of m ( Venus ) , and p its inclination : the orbit of m ' ( the Earth ) being supposed to coincide with the plane of xy .
Let v , the longitude of m , be measured* by adding the angular distance of m from its node to the longitude of the node .
Then v0 is the distance of m from the node .
Let r be the true radius vector of m : then xr ' r. cos v y ' = r ' .
sin v ' xr { cos ( v ) .
cos sin ( v- ) .
sin d. cos }yr { cos ( vd).sin a+ sin ( v ).cos D. cos p } = r. sin ( v ) .
sin p Substituting these , the expression for R becomes ${ cos ( v ' ) .

sin ( v - ) +r in which it must be remarked that r and v , when expressed in terms of t , will not involve the constants O and p. This may be changed into 4m { cos ( v-v ) sin -.cos ( vt-v ) + sin2 2 cos ( v ' + v-2 d ) m/ 7-8err .

The first line of this may be expanded in the form { I ( 0 ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) m { , C-O+ Vv ) cos ( v'-v ) + cos(2 v'-2 v)+ &amp;c. ( 0 ) ( 1 ) where 1 , r , &amp;c. , are functions of r ' and r. We must then express r ' and ( 0 ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) r in terms of n't and n t , and must substitute these values in r , , , I ' , &amp;c. and must express v ' and v in terms of n't and n t ; and on multiplying the respective expressions we shall have the development necessary for our method .
6 .
Now upon expressing r ' in terms of n't , the following remarkable law always holds : The index of the term of lowest order in the coefficient of such an argument as cos ( p n't + A ) , is p. The same is true with regard to the development of r , v ' , and v. 7 .
Now such a term as A cos 13 n't 8n t+B } can be produced only by the multiplication of cos ( k n't -kn t+k st-s ) , ( from the first term in the development of cos ( k v ' k v ) with is ( 13 c k ) ( n't + s ' ) and COS ( k ) sin ( 8 c k ) ( nt+ - ) ( occurring in the development of k v ' kv , or of Fr( ) The largest term in the coefficient , according to the rule just explained , will be of the order whose index is the sum of 13 c\ k and 8c kc .
Now if k be &lt; 8 , as for instance if k be 7 , the index of the order is 6+1= 7 , or the term is of the 7th order , and therefore is to be rejected .
And if k be &gt; 13 , as for instance if k= 14 , the index of the order is 1+6= 7 , and the term is to be rejected .
But if k be 8 , or 13 , or any number between them , as for instance 10 , then the order of the term is 3+2= 5 , and the term is to be kept .
It appears therefore that the only terms which we shall have occasion to develope , are ( 8).(9 ) ( 13 ) I C. cos(8v 8 v ) , r C. cos(9 -9 v ) , &amp;c. as far as l.cos ( 13v'13v ) inclusively .
Supposing then k to be not less than 8 nor greater than 13 , the term Sikl ( kn't-knt + ks'kg ) must be multiplied by sin ( ( 13 k ) ( n't + a'-w- ' ) + ( k8 ) ( n t+ s- ) ) in order to produce a term of the form A cos ( 13 n't 8nt+ B ) whose coefficient is of the 5th order .
The latter factor must have arisen from the product of two such terms as e ' -k .
s(13 ) ( n't + s ' - ) and e 8.cos ( k8 ) ( n t+ a ) .
The expansion of such a product will always produce two terms , one of which has for argument the sum of the arguments of the factors , and the other has the difference of the same arguments .
The point to which I wish particularly to call the attention of the reader is this : The term of the product depending on the sum of the arguments is the only one which is useful to us .
For instance ; the product of e'2 .
sin 2 ( n't + ' / ' ) and e3 .
sin 3 ( nt+ ) will be e12 e3.cos ( 2n'/ + 3nt+ 2e ' + 3s 2w -3w ) +2 e'2 e3 .
cos ( 2 n't 3nt+2'3s2 '+ 3 ) ; the combination of the first term with cos ( 11 n't 11 nt 11 ' 11 s ) will produce a term of the form A cos ( 13 n't 8nt+ B ) whose coefficient is of the 5th order : the second term will not produce a term of that form .
We might choose terms , as e ' .
sin ( n't + ' a ' ) and e6 .
sin 6 ( n t+s w ) such that the part of the product depending on the difference of the arguments , or 2e e6 .
cos ( n't 6nt +s'6 w ' +6 -a ) combining with such a term as cos ( 14 n't-14 nt+ 14 '14 s ) , would produce a term of the form required : but its coefficient would not be of the 5th order .
It is equally necessary to remark that , in multiplying the term thus selected by cs ( k n'tk nt+kk ) , we again preserve only that sin part of the product depending on the sum of the arguments .

On the circumstance that , in taking the product of two circular functions , we have to retain only the term whose argument is the sum of the arguments , depends the principle of our notation .
For whenever ( in an advanced stage of the operations ) such a term as cis ( 2 n't +3nt+2'+3 s2 w'-3 occurs , we shall know that , being formed in accordance with this rule , it must IIDCCCXXXII .
L 73 have arisen from the product of e2 cs ( 2z't +2 s'2Wand e ?
( 3 n+g- ' its coefficient therefore can only be e'2e3 .
And conversely , from seeing this coefficient , we should be certain that the argument would be 2 ( n't + s'- ' ) +3 ( n t+ -z ) .
Instead therefore of writing e'2e3 .
cos ( 2 n't +3nt+2 '+ 3 s-2 '3 , ) we might simply write e'2 e3 .
cos omitting the argument entirely .
But it will be found more convenient to retain the figures in the argument , writing it thus , e'2 e3 .
cos ( 2 + 3 ) the first figure being always appropriated to the accented argument .
And when this term is multiplied by cos ( 11 n't-1 nt + 11 '1 1 ) or cos ( 11-11 ) , we may write down the result '2e3 .
cos ( 13 8 ) without any fear of mistake .
For we know that the argument must have been produced by adding 2 ( n't + ' ' ) , 3 ( n t+s w ) , and 11 ( n't nt+ s ' s ) , and thus when a result is obtained the term can be filled up .

If we examine the second line in the last expression of ( 4 ) , it is easily seen that sin2 , a quantity of the second order ( considering sin x as of the same order with e ' and e ) enters as multiplier into two terms : of which the first , or sin2 .
cos ( v'v ) , when developed will have in every term one part of the argument produced by a subtraction ; and therefore , when combined with the expansion of the term multiplying it , will produce terms cos ( 13 8 ) of the 7th order at lowest ; the first term therefore is useless .
But the second , or sin2 o. co v is exactly analogous toexe2 cogo so ( v ' + v2 ) , which would arise from the product of e2 cos ( 2v 2 a ) and cos ( v ' v ) , and to which all the preceding remarks would apply ; and examination would show that in the development of this term , in which products of sin2 -p with powers of e ' and e will occur , the same rule must be followed , namely , that the only useful terms in the products are those in which the arguments are added .
And whenever sin2 occurs in the coefficient , -2 0 occurs in the argument ; so that there will be no possibility of mistake in using the notation described in ( 9 ) .
11 .
On examining the third line in the last expression of ( 4 ) , it will be seen in the same manner that the only part of -2sin4 { fcos ( v'-v ) -cos ( v'+ v-2 ) to be preserved is sin4 .
cos ( 2v'+ 2v4 ) .
The same remarks apply to this term as to the last ; and for a similar reason the notation of ( 9 ) may be used without fear of mistake .
12 .
By the use of this notation we may in some instances materially shorten our expressions .
For instance , we might have the terms F e ' e4 .
cos ( n't +4nt+'+4 s-t-4w ) +Ge'e2sin2 .
cos ( 't+ 4nt+ ' +4 e-'-2-2 0 ) +H e'sin4 ~- .
cos ( nt +4 nt + '+ 4 s-a-4 6 ) All this would be expressed without the possibility of mistake by the following term , ( Fe ' e e'e2 sin2 +H e ' sin4 os .
cos ( 1 + 4 ) .
The utility of such abridgments , and the quantity of disgusting labour which they spare , can be conceived only by those who have gone through the drudgery of performing the actual operation .
13 .
It is only necessary to add that when we have , for the coefficient of a cosine or sine , a series proceeding by powers of e ' , e , sin2 { , &amp;c. we may always neglect all after the lowest power .
For instance , the correct expression for v is n t+s +(2e+ C e5- &amp;c. ) sin ( n t+ ) L2 75
