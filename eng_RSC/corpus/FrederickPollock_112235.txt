( Abstract .
) The object of this paper is to show the result of combining the three series ( which have been the subject of previous communicas tions ) in a square , in such manner that the division into 4 squares of certain terms in each series , may produce a division into 4 squares of every term of other series , and thus each term in the whole square will at last be divided into 4 squares , and the first term will be so divided into 4 square numbers that two of the roots will be equal to each other ; two of them will differ by 1 , and the algebraic sum of all the roots will be equal to 1 .
It is not offered ( at present ) as a proof that it must be so , but as a method by which that result may always ( in fact ) be obtained .
If any odd number 2n1 be increased by 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , &amp;c. , the ( 2n + l)th term will be ( 2n+1)2 ; other terms will have a distinct arithmetic relation to n , and n+ 1 , and the whole series will be such that , if the pth term can be divided into square numbers whose roots shall equal 2p--1 , then every term of the whole series can be so divided that the roots of the ( p+ l)th term will be 2p+ 1 , and so on through the whole series .
13579 11 Let 27 , 29 , 33 , 39 , 47 , 57 , &amp;c. be such a series , with the odd 2 22 numbers as indices of the sums of the roots , 39=--2 +1+3+5 , and the sum of the roots is 7 , and the differences of the roots , placed in arithmetic order , will be 3 .

2 ; then 29 will have roots with 2 -322 322 the same differences , the sum being 3 , -3 , 0 , 2 , 4=29 , and 57 will 2322 have roots -1 , 2 , 4 , 6=57 .
The other numbers in the series will have the differences reversed , but the sums of the roots will be respectively as the odd numbers placed as the index of each .
If any odd number be increased by 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , &amp;c. , so as to form a series , 2n+ 1 , 2n+ 5 , 2n+ 13 , 2n +25 , pth term ( 2n + ( p-)2 , +p2 ) , it will have in the first term 4 roots , 2 of which differ by 1 ; in the 2nd term , 4 roots , 2 of which differ by 3 ; in the 3rd term 4 roots , 2 of which differ by 5 ; in the nth term 4 roots , 2 of which differ by 2n- ; the other two roots will be common to all the terms .
If these odd numbers , 1 , 3 , 5 , &amp;c. , be made indices of the 1st , 2nd , 3rd , &amp;c. terms , and any one term can be found having 2 roots differing by the index of that term , then the roots of all the other terms may be found .
Let 27 increase by 4 , 8 , 12 , &amp;c. , 13579 27 31 39 51 67 , &amp;c. but 392 , 3 , 1 , 5 , and 2 , 3 dier by .
Then the terms of the but 39 = 2 , 3 , 1 , 5 , and -2 , 3 differ by 5 .
Then the terms of the whole series may be divided into 4 squares , 2 of which will be common to all the terms , and the other 2 will have the difference pointed out by the index .
The roots are placed below each term , and the middle roots are common to all the terms : 13579 11 27 31 39 51 67 87 , &amp;c. 0,1,5,1 -1,1,5,2 -2,1,5,3 -3,1,5,4 -4,1,5,5 -5,1,5,6 If an odd number ( 2n+ 1 ) be increased by 2 , 6 , 10 , 14 , &amp;c. , and 2n + l , 2n +3,2n9 , 2n+ 19 , 2n+ ( 3p-1)2 , ( p1)2 , 1 ( pth term ) be the resulting series , then , if the even numbers ( beginning with 0 ) be made indices , and any term in the series can be divided into 4 squares , 2 of them having their roots with the algebraic difference pointed out by the index , then the other 2 roots will be common to all the terms , and in a similar manner all the terms will have roots corresponding with the index of each term .
The series 2n+ 1 , 2n+ 5 , 2n+ 13 , 2n +25 , &amp;c. will have for its nth term n2 , + n2+ ( , for its nth term is obviously 2n+(n1)2 +n2=n2 + n2 + ; the ( n-l)thtermwillbe(n-1 ) ' , +(n-1)2 + ( ; and going backwards to the first term , the roots ( n1 ) , ( n1 ) decrease by 1 , and the arithmetic number increases by 2 ; but this obtains beyond the first term into a continuation of the series backwards ; thus , 23 15 11 11 15 23 35 51 2()2 I , 11 00 1(1)l 272 3(53 4(4 5(5 .
Instead of this mode of continuing the roots and arithmetic numbers , they may be applied thus:1 3579 11 13 17 0( ?

4 squares , as to which the roots of 2 of them will differ by 1 .

order to understand the If an odd number , as 11 ( see diagram , No.l ) , be placed in the upper line on the left-hand square of a larger square divided into small squares , and be made the first term of a series , increasing by 4 , 8 , 12 , &amp;c. , and then each term of that series be made the first term of a series increasing by 2 , 6 , 10 , 14 , &amp;c. , the square will be completed , and every odd number in the small squares will be a term in both series ; but if a diagonal be drawn from 11 to 121 , and parallel from 02468 10 13 to 101 , and beginning with 13 , a number be taken from each line alternately , a series of the first kind will be discovered , viz. one increasing by 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , &amp;c. , and every term in that series will become the first term of another similar series ; so that every odd number in the small squares ( except those in the top row ) will be terms in 2 such series , and the indices will be as marked in the right-hand upper corner of each square ; the numbers in the margin 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , &amp;c. , and 0 , 2 , 4 , 5 , &amp;c. , are the indices of all the series , parallel to them .
2 Now 51 = 0 , 1 , 5 , 5 .
No two roots differ by 9 ; but 5=,5 ; and 5+5-1=9 .
As 5=5 , all the numbers below 51 , that is 53 , 59 , &amp;c. , are divided into 4 square numbers , whose roots appear in the diagram .
Again , 35 =42 , 42+ =32 , 52+l , and 35= -1,0,3,5 , which gives 7 , the index of 35 , as a term in the series increasing by 2 , 4 , 6 , &amp;c. ; and therefore every term may be resolved into 4 squares ; but as one series crosses a set of series , it at length furnishes the index , thus , 51 , 37 , 31 , on arriving at -0 , --1,5,5 -1 , -2,4 , 4 -2 , -3,3 , 3 31 .
2+3= 5 , the index of 31 as a term in the series increasing by 4 , 8 , 12 , &amp;c. ; and 19 therefore equals 0 , 1 , 3 , 3 ; and -1 , 3=4 ( the index of 19 as a term in the 3rd series ) ; 11=0 , 3 , 1 , 1 .
The method by which the division of certain numbers into 4 squares is here accomplished applies to all numbers of the form 2n + 1 ; but as the first term increases , the methods also multiply , so as to afford increasing means of division , which must be the subject of a future communication .
