SOME years ago , in examining the properties of the triangular or trigonal numbers n.(n1 ) 0 , 1 , 3 , 6 , 10 , 15 , &amp;c. --n- , I observed that every trigonal number was composed of 4 trigonal numbers , viz. 3 times some prior trigonal number plus the next in the series , either immediately before or after that prior number ; thus 45=10+10+10+15 55=15+15+15+10 ; or generally , as all numbers are of the form 2n1 or of 2n , all trigonal numbers are of one of the 2 forms , 2n2n , 2n2+n , n2--n n2n 2n2-n= X 3+ and n +n n2-n 2n2+n2 X3+ 2I found also that all the natural numbers in the interval between any two consecutive trigonal numbers , might be composed of 4 trigonal numbers , having the sum of their bases or roots constant , viz. the sum of the roots or bases of the 4 trigonal numbers which compose the first of the 2 trigonal numbers .
This will be best explained by an example : the roots or bases are placed over the numbers , and it will be observed their sum is constant in the same interval .
From 55 to 66 ( =--15 , 556 15 , 15 , 21 ) the constant suim of the bases will be 19 , and this may be continued without limit .
If the law by which this can be continued were discovered and proved , it would furnish the means of proving FERMAT'S theorems of the polygonal numbers ; but not being aware of any law by which the series that fills up the intervals could be continued , I turned my attention to the square numbers as containing ( apparently ) a greater variety of theorems , and as being ( certainly ) of all quadratic forms that which 8x9 _22 VY1 lOxlI 2 =15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 17 17 17 17 17 * 17 17 17 17 =19 = is most familiar , and in which calculations or comparisons may be made with the greatest facility .
Very lately I observed the following property of square numbers : If any four square numbers a2 , b2 , c2 , d2 have their roots such that by making one or more positive and the rest negative , the algebraic sum of the roots may equal 1 ; then if the roots whose sum is one less than the others be each increased by 1 , and the others be each decreased by 1 , the sum of the squares of the roots thus increased and decreased will be equal to a2+b2+c2+d2+2 .
Let a+b-c--d=1 , and let c and d become c+l , d+l , and let a and b become a-1 , b-1 , then ( a1)2+(b1)2+(c+1)2+(d+ 1)2= a+b2+c2+d2+2 X ( -a--b+c+d)4 , but 2X ( -a-b+c+d)=-2 , therefore the sum of the squares of the new roots--a2+b2+c+d2+2 .
If a-b --c-d= 1 , the result is the same , decreasing a and increasing each of b , c and d by 1 .
The theorem is more general ( as might have been expected ) .
THEOREM A. For if instead of 1 the algebraic sum of the roots be equal to 2n1 , and the negative roots be numerically increased by n and the positive roots be decreased by n , the increase in the sum of the squares of the new roots thus formed will be 2n .
Let a+bc-d=2n--1 , then ( a-n)2+(b--n)2+(c+n)2+ ( d+n)2=-a2+b2+c2+d -2an-2bn+2cn+2dn+4n2 , but -2an--2bn+2cn+2dn=(2n--1 ) X2n=--4n2 +2n,. .
the sum of the squares of the new roots=a2+b2+c2+d2+2n .
The following table shows the result of different algebraic sums of the roots , with the corresponding increase or decrease of roots and increase of the sum of the squares .

&amp;c. There is a similar theorem with respect to the decrease of the sum of the squares .
THEOREM B. If a+b-c-d=-2n+1 ( instead of 2n-1 ) , then if a and b be each diminished and c and d be increased by n , the sum of the squares of the new roots will be less by 2n , and ( a-n)2+ ( b--n)2+(c+n)2+(d+n)2 will equal a2+b2+c2+d2-2n .

&amp; c The use that may be made of these theorems will best appear by an example or two .
51 is composed of 4 square numbers , 25 , 16 , 9 , 1 , whose roots are 5 , 4 , 3 , 1 .
4+35115+341=35 + " 43 -1 -5 5+4+1-3=7 5+4+13=7 Then by Theorern A. square numbers which compose 53 , 55 , 57 , and 59 may be obtained , and by Theorem B. those which compose 49 , 47 , and 45 by adding to or subtracting from the roots ; thus 5+4 -3 15=2X3 1 , n= 33333 being deducted or added , 2164 become the new roots , the sum of whose squares=57=51 +2 X 3 .
5+4+13=7=2X3+ 1 , n=333332 1--2 6 are the new roots , the squares=45=51-2 X 3 .
Again , 5510 are roots of squares which compose 51 , 5+5+10= I1 2X6 1 , n= 666661156 the squares of these new + 12 ( 51+2 X 6 ) .
Also ; sulm of whose roots = 63.= 51 5+ 51 092X5 I , n=555550065 the squares of these new roots 61 by Theorein A. ; by Theorem B. the squares which compose 41 and 43 may be found , and thus the square numbers ( not exceeding 4 ) which compose 51 being given , square numbers not exceeding 4 may be discovered , which compose 41 , 43 , and all the intermediate odd numbers up to 63 .
This method of obtaining the square numbers that compose a succession of odd numbers , suggested that if a method similar to what was observed in the trigonal numbers were adopted as to the square numbers , the series of odd numbers might be resolved into square numbers .
In the trigonal numbers the successive bases of the 4 trigonal numbers into which the terms of the trigonal series are each divisible , are o001011111212222223233 3 &amp; c , If instead of using these numbers as bases or roots of trigonal numbers they be squared and added together , they furnish a series ( 1 , 3 , 7 , 13 , 21 , 31 , &amp;c. ) whose general term is m2+m+l or according asm nis even or odd , 4n2+2n+ 1 : this expression is manifestly divisible into square numbers whose roots will be either n , n , n , n+ or n1 , n , n , n , and the sum of the roots will be 4n ? ?
1 , and with reference to integral quantities will be a maximum .
The terms of the series 1 , 3 , 7 13 , &amp;c. , furnish steps , places , or positions at which the process of increasing the sum of the squares might commence again , and as far as any law of increase is applicable to one term it is applicable to all .
I have therefore called this series 1 , 3 , 7 , 13 , &amp;c. the gradationseries of this system of resolving the odd numbers into square numbers not exceeding 4 .
I have prepared a table in which the odd numbers from 1 to 191 , respectively , are divided into square numbers not exceeding 4 , the algebraic sum of whose roots may be made equal to 1 .
This table of the odd numbers up to 191 is at the end of the paper the terms pf the gradation-series ( as they occur ) are distinctively denoted , and all the sets of roots of the odd numbers up to 191 are capable of forming 1 as their algebraic sum ; and by means of this series any odd number from 4n2 ?
2n1+l up to 4n2+2n+191 inclusive , may be divided into not exceeding 4 square numbers , whatever be the value of n. The examination of this series led me to observe a remarkable property of odd numbers with reference to the square numbers ( not exceeding 4 ) into which they may be divided , and which may be stated in the following theorem , THEOREM C. Every odd number may be divided into square numbers ( not exceeding 4 ) , the algebraic sum of whose roots ( positive or negative ) will ( in some form of the roots ) be equal to every odd number from 1 to the greatest possible sum of the roots , or the theorem may be stated in a purely algebraical form thus : If there be 2 equations , +-b'+-+c d=2n+ I and a+b+c+d=2r+1 , a , c , d being each integral or nil , n and r being positive , and ra maxiium , then if 2 s2 any positive integer r ' ( not , greater than r ) be assumed , it will always be possible to satisfy the pair of equations w =2+-y2-+z=2n+ 1 w+x+y+z=2r'+ 1 by integral values ( positive , negative , or nil ) of w , x , y , z. I now propose to show in what manner the table may be used , so as to divide into square numbers ( not exceeding 4 ) any odd number from 1 up to 9503 , and any odd numbet whatever of the form 4n2+2n+2p+1 , where p is not greater than 95 [ 95 X 2+-1 =1911 .
If 2p+ 1 =a2+b2+c2+d2 , and if also a+b+c+d= 1 ( a , b , c , d being integral numbers , positive , negative or nil ) , in other words , if the odd number 2pl be such that the algebraic sum of the troots of the square numbers ( not exceeding 4 ) which compose it may be equal to 1 , then it will follow that m2+m+ l+2p may be resolved into square numbers ( not exceeding 4 ) the sum of whose roots will equal 2m+ 1 , for m2+m +1 is of the form 4n2-+2n+l ; let it equal it , and m2+m+1+2p=4n2+2n , ( a+b +c+d ) +a2+b2+ c2+d2= ( na)2+ ( n+b)2+ ( n+)2+ ( n+d)2 ( manifestly 4 square numbers ) , and the sum of the roots=4n+ ( a+b+c+d ) 4n+ 1 =2m+ 1 .
Let the function m2+m+1 be designated by the notation fn .
If every odd number from 1 up to 2m+ 1 can be resolved into ( not exceeding ) 4 square numbers , the algebraic sum of whose roots may equal 1 , then every odd number fiomfm tofm +2m inclusive may be resolved into 4 square numbers , the sum of whose roots may equal 2m+1 ; but the next odd number tofm+2m isf(m+l ) , and sincef(mn+l ) is resolvable into 4 square numbers , the sum of whose roots=2m+3 ; if every odd number from 1 up to 2m+1 can be resolved into not exceeding 4 square numbers the algebraic sum of whose roots=l , then every odd number from 1 up to f(m+ l)+2m is resolvable into 4 square numbers , and f(m+1)+2m=m 2+5m+3 .
In the Table the highest odd number 191 _=2X95+1 , therefore m=95 ; and every odd number from 1 up to 952+5 X95+3=9503 may be resolved into not exceeding 4 square numbers , by means of the Table , also every odd number of the form 4n2+2n +2p+l , whatever be the value of n , provided p be not greater than 95 ; for example , let it be required to resolve 9301 into 4 square numbers , the next less number of the form m2+m+1 is 9121952+95+1 =448--2'48 8+1 , 9301=9120+-181 .
181 by the Table is resolvable into ] .
2+42+82+ ]02 and -1+4+8-10=1 9301=(48+ 1)2+(484)2+ ( 48-8)2+(48+10)2 =492+442+-402+582 ; so 4n2+L+181 is always resolvable into 4 square numbers , whatever be the value of n , and the roots of the square numbers will be ( nT 1 ) , ( n+ 4 ) , ( n+8 ) , ( nf 10 ) .
If the following series of equations be assumed , 1+2d =2q+l 3+2d=2q+ 1 7+2d2=2q+ 13+2d , =2q+ I m2+m+ 1 +2dm_ , =2q+1 , and if each of the quantities 2d+ 1 , 2d , + 1 , 2d+ 1 , 2d , + 1 ... 2dm-I+l can be resolved into 4 square numbers , the algebraic sum of whose roots=l , then the given odd number 2q+1 may be resolved into successive sets of 4 squares , the sum of whose roots will be successively 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 ... 2m+1 .
Hence an odd number , 2q+l , may be resolved into 4 square numbers , the sum of whose roots shall be equal to 2p+1 , if upon adding 1 to the difference between 2q -1 and the ( p+ 1 ) " term of the gradationseries , the difference so increased can be resolved into 4 square numbers , the algebraic sum of whose roots= 1 .
If it be required to resolve 37 into 4 squares , the sum of whose roots shall equal 7=2 3+1 , here p=3 , the ( p+ 1 ) " or 4th term of the gradation-series is 13 ; 13 is of the form 4-22-222+1 , and it equals 22+22+22+12 ( 2--)2 ; the difference between 37 and 14=24 , increased by 1=25 , 25=12+22+22 +42 , and the roots+1--2--2+41 and 13+24=(2+2)2=42 , 42 , 12 , -22 ( 2+2)2 ( 21)2 ( 24)2 and +4+4+1-2=7 .
If , therefore , every odd number can be resolved into integral square numbers ( not exceeding 4 ) whose algebraic sum will equal 1 , then every odd number can be resolved into integral square numbers ( not exceeding 4 ) whose algebraic sum will be 1 , 3 , 5 , &amp;c. [ viz. all the odd numbers up to the maximum ] .
I propose ( in order not to leave the Theorern C. unproved ) to show by the properties of numbers already proved , that every odd number may be resolved into integral square numbers ( not exceeding 4 ) whose algebraic sum will equal 1 .
Every odd number may be represented by 2p+1 ( p being any integer ) : then by FERMAT'S theorem of the polygonal numbers ( as proved by LEGENDRE , Th6orie des nombres ) , p must either be a trigonal number , or composed of two or three trigonal numbers .
If it be a trigonal number , then p= 2 and 2p+=q2+q+l , which equals 4n2+2n+ 1 , which is divisible into ( n ? ?
1)2 , n2 , n n2 , and n-n+r.+ ( n+ 1l)=l .
qK+ q r2+r Ifp be composed of 2 trigonal numbers , p= --+ , and the sum of any two trigonal numbers is of the form of a2+a+b2* and may be assumed equal to a2+a+b2 , therefore 2p+1=2a2+2a+2b2+l = ( a+1)2 , a , b , b2 , and the roots ( a+l ) , a , b , -b , =l .
If p be composed of 3 trigonal numbers , then p=a2+a+b'2+ and 2p+l1=2a2+2a+2b'+m2+1 , but m'+m+ 1 is of the form 4n2+2n+ 1 , whose four roots ( as already seen ) are n+ 1 , n , n , n , and if these roots be varied thus , +a+n+ I a-n b+n b-n , the squares of these four roots will equal 2a2+2a+2b2+4n2+2n+ 1 , and the algebraic sum of these roots obviously may=l .
It follows from this , that every possible odd number may be divided into integral square numbers ( not exceeding 4 ) , the algebraic sum of whose roots 1 .
I propose in a future communication to give a different proof of the Theoiem C , and instead of proving ' the Theorem C. by FERMAT'S proposition of the trigonal numbers , I sLall offer a proof of FERMAT'S proposition of the trigonal numbers by the Theorenm C ; it is obvious that they are so connected that either may be proved from the other .
I am not aware that the theorems A , B , or C , or the method above described of using a gradation-series , have ever been noticed before , and as they appear to add something ( however little ) to the theory of numbers , I have ventured to present them to the attention of the Royal Society .
NOTE.-Numbers of the form 2n+2 ( even numbers ) may be resolved into square numbers ( not exceeding 4 ) , the algebraic sum of whose roots may always equal 2 , and so far they have an analogous property , but they do not possess the analogous property of being resolvable into roots whose algebraic sum will=2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , &amp;c. of odd numbers and of the Roots of the squares ( not exceeding 4 ) into which they may be divided , whose algebraic sum may equal 1 .
