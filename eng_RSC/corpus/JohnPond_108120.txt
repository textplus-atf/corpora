Continuation of a former Paper on the Twenty-five Feet Zenith Telescope lately erected at the Royal Observatory .
By JOHN POND , Esq. A.R. F.R.S. Received March 11 , -Read March 12 , 1835 .
DURING the last summer I had the honour of submitting to this Society a short paper on the subject of the large zenith telescope lately erected at this Observatory .
It is now nearly twenty years since the erection of such an instrument was first suggested to the President and Council of this Society ; at that time the Royal Observatory was in a very inefficient state compared to what it is at present .
We had only one circle ; and there existed doubts as to the excellence of this instrument , though not any were ever entertained by me .
The erection of a second circle put this question at rest ; it has been abundantly shown in various volumes of the Greenwich Observations , by a series of more rigorous investigations than any instrument was ever submitted to before , that both the circles may be considered as perfect , their errors being less than their respective makers themselves assigned .
This circumstance , though satisfactory to myself , a little diminished the importance of the new zenith telescope .
It was hardly to be expected that any new instrument could throw light upon errors already reduced within such small limits ; this , however , has been done , and the object of this paper is to explain the process I have employed for the purpose .
Whoever is acquainted with the method of constructing the Greenwich Catalogue , must have perceived that the places of those stars which are observed by reflection are , according to all probability , more exactly determined than those which have been observed only by direct vision .
y Draconis , a star which since the time of BRADLEY has been of first-rate importance in the Greenwich Observations , cannot be observed by reflection .
The probability of error was therefore greater in the place of this star than in that of any other .
The new instrument has shown that this error does not exceed a quarter of a second ; a degree of accuracy scarcely credible , and no doubt requiring to be confirmed by future observations .
The nature of the question to be determined in this case has happily produced a competition for excellence among the observers with the different instruments , which gives me an opportunity of showing the present state of practical astronomy at Greenwich .
The new instrument has been employed during the last summer under very unfavourable circumstances , both the building and the instrument having been almost constantly under repair .
It is not requisite on this occasion to enter into the details of these difficulties ; I only wish to explain the natiure of the experiments , the results of which I am now about to lay before the Society .
We have now three distinct methods of determining the place of any star passing the meridian near the zenith .
First , by means of the mural circles ; secondly , by the zenith telescope used alternately east and west , as is usually done with -similar instruments ; and lastly , by means of a small subsidiary star , as described by me last year in a paper laid before this Society , and which I am inclined to think more exact than any other method .
By the following computations it will be seen that the three methods give results nearly identical ; and that when the observations with the two circles are numerous and made with sufficient care , a quarter of a second is the greatest error to be apprehended .

The above results ( column 3rd ) are those that have been obtained with the greatest care during their respective periods ; and having been deduced from observations with the zenith sector , they are quite independent of the latitude of the Observatory .
M. BESSEL 's formula is deduced from the observations for the first sixty years , and therefore agree very well ; but when we attempt to predict from the observations of these sixty years the place of the stars for twenty years to come , we find a difference of 1"`74 between the predicted and observed zenith distance , the observed place being this quantity south of it .
Explanation of the foregoing TABLES .
Table I. contains the results of 60 observations of the small star Bode 170 Draconis , made with JONES'S circle , and is intended to show what degree of accuracy may be obtained by extreme care .
The mean difference 0"'357 , column 3 , between the mean of the whole and each result , ( and which is nearly the probable error of a single observation from this series , ) de-monstrates with what care they have been made .
The same may be said with respect to the mean difference of column 4 , namely , 0"'155 , which is similarly obtain ( d from the mean of the whole and the mean of each ten ( a quantity which represents nearly the probable erroIr of the mean of ten observations ) .
However , it may be remarked , that the exact coincidence exhibited throughout this series does not prove the truth of the final north polar distance of the star here assigned , since some omissions or errors in the process of reduction would affect it .
That no instrumental error exists is demonstrated by the identity of the result with that obtained with the new instrument .
Table II .
contains the same observations arranged in a different manner .
This is the arrangement I have advantageously followed in investigating the difference of parallax ; the object being to distinguish the effect arising from accidental error of observation from that which is due to any permanent astronomical cause .
150 This method should be employed when the object is to judge of the consistency of observations , without any reference to the astronomical result .
Table III .
shows the manner in which the difference in zenith distance between the two stars is obtained by means of the circles ; a quantity , as I have shown , of the highest importance in the investigation .
This quantity , having been determined by the microscopes of the lrespective circles , might be erroneous if the runs of the microscopes were not exact , although the error here must be very small , twelve microscopes being constantly used .
But as they have lately been taken down , examined , and replaced , without any sensible alteration , it may be presumed that the error from this source is sufficiently corrected .
Table IV .
This Table contains in a very compressed form the result of an immense number of observations of y Draconis during a period of eighty years ; and it will be seen that if from M. BESSEL'S formula* , deduced from the first sixty years of these observations , we attempt to predict or assign the place of the star for the present time or twenty years in advance , the star will be found 1"75 south of its computed place .
