A numerical Table of elective Attractions ; with Remarks on the Sequences of double Decompositions .
By Thomas Young , M. D. For .
Sec. R. S. Read February 9 , 1809 .
ATTEMPTS have been made , by several chemists , to obtain a series of numbers , capable of representing the mutual attractive forces of the component parts of different salts ; but these attempts have hitherto been confined within narrow limits , and have indeed been so hastily abandoned , that some very important consequences , which necessarily follow from the general principle of a numerical representation , appear to have been entirely overlooked .
It is not impossible , that there may be some cases , in which the presence of a fourth substance , besides the two ingredients of the salt , and the medium in which they are dissolved , may influence the precise force of their mutual attraction , either by affecting the solubility of the salt , or by some other unknown merans , so that the number , naturally appropriate to the combination , may no longer correspond to its affections ; but there is reason to think that such cases are rare ; and when they occur , they may easily be noticed as exceptions to the general rules .
It appears therefore , that nearly all the phenomena of the mutual actions of a hundred different salts may be correctly represented by a hundred numbers , while , in the usual manner of relating every case as a different experiment , above two thousand separate articles would be required .
Having been engaged in the collection of a few of the principal facts relating to chemistry and pharmacy , I was induced to attempt the investigation of a series of these numbers ; and I have succeeded , not without some difficulty , in obtaining such as appear to agree sufficiently well with all the cases of double decompositions which are fully established , the exceptions not exceeding twenty , out of about twelve hundred cases enumerated by FouRcRoY .
The same numbers agree in general with the order of simple elective attractions , as usually laid down by chemical authors ; but it was of so much less importance to accommodate them to these , that I have not been very solicitous to avoid a few inconsistencies in this respect , especially as many of the bases of the calculation remain uncertain , and as the common tables of simple elective attractions are certainly-imperfect , if they are considered as indicating the order of the independent attractive forces of the , substances concerned .
Although it cannot be expected that these numbers should be accurate measures of the forces , which they represent , yet they may be supposed to be tolerable approximations to such measures , at least if any two of them are nearly in the true proportion , it is probable that the rest cannot deviate very far from it : thus , if the attractive force of the phosphoric acid for potash is about eight tenths of that of the sulfuric acid for barita , that of the phosphoric acid for barita must be about nine tenths as great ; but they are calculated only to agree with a certain number of phenomenea , and will probably require many alterations , as well as additions , when all other similar phenomena shall have been accurately investigated .
There is , however , a method of representing the facts , which , 149 have served as the bases of the determination , independently of any hypothesis , and without being liable to the contingent necessity of any future alteration , in order to make room for the introduction of the affections of other substances ; and this method enables us also to compare , upon general principles , a multitude of scattered phenomena , and to reject many which have been mentioned as probable , though doubtful , with the omission of a very few only which have been stated as ascertained .
This arrangement simply depends on the supposition , that the attractive force , which tends to unite any two substances , may always be represented by a certain constant quantity .
From this principle it may be inferred , in the first place , that there must be a sequence in the simple elective attractions .
For example , there must be an error in the common tables of elective attractions , in which magnesia stands above ammonia under the sulfuric acid , and below it under the phosphoric , and the phosphoric acid stands above the sulfuric under magnesia , and below it under ammonia , since such an arrangement implies , that the order of the attractive forces is this ; phosphate of magnesia , sulfate of magnesia , sulfate of ammonia , phosphate of ammonia , and again phosphate of magnesia ; which forms a circle , and not a sequence .
We must therefore either place magnesia above ammonia under the phosphoric acid , or the phosphoric acid below the sulfuric under magnesia ; or we must abandon the principle of a numerical representation in this particular case .
In the second place , there must be an agreement between the simple and double elective attractions .
Thus , if the fluoric acid stands above the nitric under barita , and below it under lime , the fluate of barita cannot decompose the nitrate of lime , since the previous attractions of these two salts are respectively greater , than the divellent attractions of the nitrate of barita and the fluate of lime .
Probably , therefore , we ought to place the fluoric acid below the nitric under barita ; and we may suppose , that when the fluoric acid has appeared to form a precipitate with the nitrate of barita , there has been some fallacy in the experiment .
The third proposition is somewhat less obvious , but perhaps of greater utility : there must be a continued sequence in the order of double elective attractions ; that is , between any two acids , we may place the different bases in such an order , that any two salts , resulting from their union , shall always decompose each other , unless each acid be united to the base nearest to it : for example , sulfuric acid , barita , potass , soda , ammonia , strontia , magnesia , glycina , alumina , zirconia , lime , phosphoric acid .
The sulfate of potass decomposes the phosphate of barita , because the difference of the attractions of barita for the sulfuric and phosphoric acids is greater than the difference of the similar attractions of potass ; and in the same manner the difference of the attractions of potass is greater than that of the attractions of soda ; consequently the difference of the attractions of barita must be much greater than that of the attractions of soda , and the sulfate of soda must decompose the phosphate of barita : and in the same manner it may be shown , that each base must preserve its relations of priority or posteriority to every other in the series .
It is also obvious that , for similar reasons , the acids may be arranged in a continued sequence between the diiffrent bases ; and when all the decompositions of a certain number of salts i.5i .
have been investigated , we may form two corresponding tables , one of the seqiuences of the bases with the acid , s and another of those of the acids with the different bases ; and if either or both of the tables are imperfect , their deficiencies may often be supplied , and their errors corrected , by a repeated comparison with each other .
In forming tables of this kind from the cases collected by FOURCROY , I have been obliged to reject some facts , which were evidently contradictory to others , and these I have not thought it necessary to mention ; a few , which are positively related , and which are only inconsistent with the principle of numerical representation , I have mentioned in notes ; but many others , which have been stated as merely probable , I have omitted without any notice .
In the table of simple elective attractions , I have retained the usual order of the different substances ; inserting again in parentheses such of them as require to be transposed , in order to avoid inconsequences in the simple attractions : I have attached to each combination marked with an asterisc the number deduced from the double decompositions , as expressive of its attractive force ; and where the number is inconsistent with the corrected order of the simple elective attractions , I have also enclosed it in a parenthesis .
Such an apparent inconsistency may perhaps in some cases be unavoidable , as it is possible that the different proportions of the masses concerned , in the operations of simple and compound decomposition , may sometimes cause a real difference in the comparative magnitude of the attractive forces .
Those numbers , to which no asterisc is affixed , are merely inserted by interpolation , and they can only be so far employed for determining the mutual actions of the salts to which they belong , as the results which they indicate would follow from the comparison of any other numbers , intermediate to the nearest of those , which are more correctly determined .
I have not been able to obtain a sufficient number of facts relating to the metallic salts , to enable me to comprehend many of them in the tables .
It has been usual to distinguish the attractions , which produce the double decompositions of salts , into necessary and superfluous attractions ; but the distinction is neither very accurate , nor very important : they might be still further divided , accordingly as two , three , or the whole of the four ingredients concerned are capable of simply decomposing the salt in which they are not contained ; and if two , accordingly as they are previously united or separate ; such divisions would however merely tend to divert the attention from the natural operation of the joint forces concerned .
It appears to be not improbable , that the attractive force of any two substances might , in many cases , be expressed by the quotient of two numbers appropriate to the substances , or rather by the excess of that quotient above unity ; thus the attractive force of many of the acids for the three principal alkalies might probably be correctly represented in this manner ; and where the order of attractions is different , perhaps the addition of a second , or of a second and third quotient , derived from a different series of numbers , would afford an accurate determination of the relative force of attraction , which would always be the weaker , as the two substances concerned stood nearer to each other in these orders of numbers ; so that , by affixing , to each simple substance , two , three , or at most four numbers only , its attractive powers might be expressed in the shortest and most general manner .
I have thought it necessary to make some alterations in the orthography generally adopted by chemists , not from a want of deference to their individual authority , but because it appears to me that there are certain rules of etymology , which no modern author has a right to set aside .
According to the orthography universally established throughout the language , without any material exceptions , our mode of writing Greek words is always borrowed from the Romans , whose alphabet we have adopted : thus the Greek vowel T , when alone , is always expressed in Latin and in English by Y , and the Greek diphthong OT by U , the Romans having no such diphthong as OU or OY .
The French have sometimes deviated from this rule , and if it were excusable for any , it would be for them , since their u and ou are pronounced exactly as the T and or of the Greeks probably were : but we have no such excuse .
Thus the French have used the term acoustique , which some English authors have converted into " acoustics ; " our anatomists , however , speak , much more correctly , of the " acustic " nerve .
Instead of glucine , we ought certainly , for a similar reason , to write glycine ; or glycina , if the names of the earths are to end in a. Barytes , as a single Greek word , means weight , and must be pronounced barytes ; but as the name of a stone , accented on the second syllable , it must be written barites ; and the pure earth may properly be called barita .
Yttria I have altered to itria , because no Latin word begins with a Y. 154 Table of the Sequences of the Bases with the different Acids .
In all mixtures of the aqueous solutions of two salts , each acid remains united to the base which stands nearest to it in this table .

AM The comparative use of this table may be understood from an example : if we suppose that the nitrate of barita decomposes the borate of ammonia , we must place the boracic acid above the nitric , between barita and ammonia in this table , and consequenltly barita below ammonia , between the fluoric and boracic in the former : hence the boracic and fluoric acids must also be transposed between barita and strontia , and between barita and potass ; or if we place the fluoric still higher than the boracic in the first instance , we must place barita below ammonia between the nitric and fluoric acids , where indeed " t is not impossible that it ought to stand .
