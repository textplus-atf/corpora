On the parallax of the fixed stars in right ascension .

IN the Connoissance des Temps for the year 18o8 , M. DELAMBRE , in a memoir on the parallax of the fixed stars , in which he relates the supposed discovery of a very considerable parallax , by two celebrated Italian astronomers , * proposes that this investigation should be attempted in right ascension .
I have often read this memoir with great attention , but have been prevented by accidental circumstances from carrying this suggestion into execution .
The investigation has since that time become infinitely more difficult , from the narrow limits into which parallax has been restricted by more recent observations .
When the subject first engaged my attention , I was cono stantly in expectation of the new instrument , and was unwilling to engage in a series of observations which would so soon be interrupted ; when this was erected , I was so much engaged in the other methods of investigation , that it was not possible to devote myself properly to this enquiry ; it was only lately that it occurred to me to examine the observations as they stood on the transit book for other purposes ; and I find that , notwithstanding they have not been regularly made at the two opposite seasons most favourable for detecting a parallax , yet a sufficient number of observations may be collected to establish the same conclusion as that which I have given in my former paper .
The stars , of which I have a sufficient number of observations for this investiga* Piazzi and Calandrell .
tion , are a Aquilae , Arcturus , Capella , and a Lyrae , Sirius iS comparatively but seldom observed , from its vicinity to the horizon .
As the observations of all the above stars give the same result , it will be sufficient to select one as an example .
I have chosen a Aquilx .
The annexed table contains t0o observations of this star ; and the following remarks will , I trust , be thought sufficiently conclusive to establish the point in question .
If a series of 12 results ( obtained by 12oo bservations ) be divided into two parts , first , according to the law of parallax , and next alternately , or in a manner perfectly accidental , then it s appens , that a greater difference is found in the latter or accidental mode of division , than in the former .
From this it is evident , that the determination of the quantity of parallax is out of the power of the instrument to determine with this number of observations .
The next question is , What are the limits within which parallax is restricted ?
In examining several series of observations , I find that the result of 60 observations , reduced to the equator , and taken accidentally , never differs from the more correct mean derived from 12o by more than o " , ol of time , when reduced to the equator .
If of IL results taken as above , the 6 least be classed together , and compared with the six greatest , the error of either class will not exceed the double of this quantity , or O",0o .
It is therefore very highly improbable indeed , that an error of this magnitude should exist in a result deduced from 6o observations .
Since , r therefore the results arranged according to the law of parallax shoulddifferby rather more than half the double parallax , infer , that it is most highly improbable that the longer 482 axis of the ellipse described by parallax should , in the brighest stars , amount to 0,5 of space , and not probable that it should amount to half this quantity , or to o",25 .
And when we consider that the minor axis of this ellipse is only measured in declination ( and in a Aquilsa this is only equal to half the major axis ) ; and that , moreover , the star is only deranged from its mean place , the half of this minor axis , I think it will nbt be very unsafe to conclude , that every attempt to discover the existence of parallax by a measure in declination , must end in disappointment .
These observations , continued for many years with the transit instrument , must in the end either detect the existence of parallax , or still more correctly define its limits .
But these appear to me even now so small , that I am not disposed to institute any farther observations with a view to this particular subject , but shall leave it to be determined by the regular course of observation.* Observations of a 1qile reducedo to Jan. , 81 7 .
