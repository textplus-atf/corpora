THE great progress which has been made within a few years in establishing the laws of magnetic action , as subsisting between magnets on each other , and of these on iron , leads to a rational expectation that the still unknown and mysterious laws of terrestrial variation may by perseverance be likewise elicited .
This hope has induced me to undertake the task of collating and arranging all the valuable information recorded in several recent and important voyages and journeys of discovery , surveys , &amp;c. , undertaken by the British and by some foreign Governments .
In all these cases the officers selected to conduct them have been of the highest scientific character : the subject of magnetism has been , during the time of their performance , the favourite pursuit of many highly talented philosophers in all parts of Europe .
Instruments of the most perfect description have been employed , and more than ordinary care bestowed upon the magnetic observations .
Many of these have been made in regions , of all others , the most interesting in such an inquiry , namely , in the vicinity of a principal focus of magnetic energy ; others are equally important from their extensive range .
In the voyage under the command of Captain BEECHEY , more than 75,000 miles of the earth 's surface were traversed , and , throughout , the errors from local attraction were carefully excluded .
The surveys of the coast of Africa , Amerlica , and New Holland , by Captains OWEN and KING , and many others which might be enumerated , performed by officers in the British navy , and the circumnavigation of the southern pole by Captain BISCOE , have alone furnished an immense stock of valuable information ; but to these we have to add the voyages by Captain LUTKE in the Russian service , of Captain DUPERREY in the French service , and the valuable references I have been enabled to obtain through the kindness of Captains BEAUFORT and IIoRSBURGH , recorded in their respective offices .
These together formed such a mass of well-authenticated observations , as seemed to render it very desirable to collect and arrange them , so as at least to furnish a sure foundation for future comparison , if not for immediate investigation .
With regard to the mode of arrangement , the charts of HIALLEY , YATES , HANSTEEN , &amp;c. , naturally led me to the idea of one of the same form , as given in the accompanying engravings ( Plates XVII .
and XVIII .
) ; but feeling dissatisfied with the great distortion of the lines in the higher latitudes , and the necessary want of continuity on the two sides of the chart , I determlined to begin ; de novo , and to lay the lines all down on a 15-inch globe , where they of course are exhibited in their natural situation , and in regular continuity , the latter condition being only attainable in the latter form ; and I extremely regret that I am not able to publish the work in this form , being so much better calculated to elucidate the subject , than any chart that can be constructed .
As I was desirous of keeping myself entirely free from any theoretical notions , my object being principally to fix the foundation for future views and comparisons , I have laid down such lines only as are drawn from actual observations , so that where these failed I have left the parts blank ; this is chiefly observable about the south pole and over lands , except in Europe , where well observed variations have enabled me to continue them over both land and water .
HIaving thus devoted the oceans to the variation lines , I had intended to have laid down the lines of equal dips upon the land : but after some consideration I have omitted these ; they might , however , be introduced without confusing the lines of variation .
On the globe I have coloured those oceans in which the variation is east , with a light green ; and where it is west , with a light blue : in the same way , if the dip lines were introduced , those parts of the land and continents in which the dip is north , and where it is south , might be distinguished by a similar contrast of colour , -a plan which relieves the eye , and assists the mind in tracing the various configurations of the several lines .
On attentively examining these lines , either in the form of a chart , or on the globe , but particularly on the latter , it Inust , I think , be acknowledged , not_-_.._ _. .

If the variations were , as has been sometimes supposed , greatly influenced by parts immediately in their vicinity , we could not expect to find that regularity which is observable in so many , if not in all parts : throughout the Atlantic Ocean , for example , there is a continuity and softness of curvature , and unity of character quite inconsistent with such a supposition ; still the lines there recorded are the legitimate deductions of a comparison of many hundred observations with each other .
Again , in the Indian Ocean we have a most extraordinary inflection of the curve of no variation , whereby we find , in traversing the earth 's equator , that two thirds of it , or 240 ?
, have easterly variation , while only 120 ?
have westerly variation ; and here again , in consequence of this extreme anomaly , I have taken particular pains , and have examined an immense number of observations , as recorded both by officers in the British navy , and in the East India Company 's ships , with the greatest care , and there is no question whatever that the lines as laid down on the globe are an exact representation of those on the earth ; but we see no such sudden interruptions of curvature as must occur if local causes were very influential .
I may also remark , that the observations in these seas are by far more accordant and positive in their character than I generally found them in other parts , -a circumstance probably attributable to the very small dip in these seas , and the consequent high intensity of the horizontal needle , which rendered it by position less liable to disturbance from local attractions , and more determinate in its direction .
Another marked peculiarity in this ocean is , that for forty degrees the line of no variation runs nearly parallel to the equator , and then for another forty degrees down a meridian ; and as in cases of no variation the magnetic pole , as we commonly understand the term , must be on the meridian of the place , it follows that the pole must also range through forty degrees , or be coincident with the pole of the world ; either of which conditions is equally inconsistent with the notion that all these phenomena are due to the action of four or more magnetic poles .
Again , referring to the remarkable curves in the great Pacific Ocean , there is , notwithstanding their peculiar character , no appearance of uncertain and 4R2 669 anomalous attractions : the whole seems to form a system by itself .
The lines , instead of extending towards the poles , as in most other parts , return upon themselves in similar , though not in regular figures : and here again I can see no possible position of four poles which can lead to such configuration .
These lines differ very considerably from those of former charts ; but they are drawn from a careful examination of observations , not so numerous , certainly , as in some other parts , but still in all probability much exceeding those on which former charts in this ocean have been constructed .
Many other peculiarities will occur to any person carefully examining the several curvatures , particularly that remarkable one found in crossing the Continent of Asia ; but as I have not had an opportunity of consulting the original authorities on which these lines are founded , I shall not offer any remark upon them , except to state that they rest on the authority of a most able and indefatigable observer , Professor HANSTEEN , only that a slight change was rendered necessary by the recent observations of Captain LUTKE on the coasts of Nova Zembla and the North of Europe .
The foregoing remarks have reference to the present state of the magnetic lines ; but their progressive change of situation and configuration is another important feature in terrestrial magnetism .
The first notice I can find of the variation itself occurs in the year 1269 , in a letter from PETRI PEREGRINI to a friend , where the author states that after several careful experiments he found it amounted to 50 east in Italy ; but the method of observation at that time was very unsatisfactory : it consisted only in touching an iron needle with the loadstone , and observing its bearing before its power was lost .
In 1580 the variation was certainly 114 ?
east in London : about 1658 it was zero , the needle pointing then due north .
In 1700 it was about 8 degrees west , at which time it was zero on the coast of America in the vicinity of New York , and it has remained at the latter place nearly the same ever since .
It follows , therefore , that about the year 1660 , the line of no variation must have crossed the Atlantic nearly at right angles to the meridians , as it does now in the Indian Ocean .
From that time it has been gradually descending towards the south and west , and at present crosses some way inland on the eastern point of South Amnerica .
670 We have not such early authority for that line of no variation which passes through Australia , but since that country has been pretty well known , at least for 60 years , very little if any change has taken place , and it seems probable the variation about this spot is as fixed as in that on the coast of America .
I refer to these two cases because they differ very considerably from all others in which a line of no variation has been known to cross ; the motion for some years before and after the actual passage of that line being generally very rapid , whereas in these it is stationary or nearly so .
Thus in London , the variation was 110 15 ' east in 1580 ; in 1658 the line of no variation passed our meridian , and in 1698 it was about 8 ?
west , giving a change of 20 ?
in a little more than 100 years ; and the same is observed in all other places where the passage of the line is well determined , while in the two places referred to , it has experienced no change , or very little , in the one , for more than 130 years , and in the other probably for as long a time , but certainly for more than 60 years .
In the West Indies , the Bermudas , and a few other places , where the variation is small , the change has also been very inconsiderable ; but I believe no case occurs where the variation is large and stationary , -a peculiarity which ought to be well considered in attempting a theory of these motions .
Another circumstance equally remarkable is , that in all cases in which sufficient registers of variation have been made , and where the motion or change has been considerable , we may always reduce that motion to a circular rotation of a certain assumed magnetic pole about the pole of the earth : that is , we may , by assuming for each place its own pole , revolving at a given uniform rate , compute the variation of the needle at any period so as to agree very nearly with observation .
CHURCHMAN , in his Atlas , I think , was the first to make this assumption , and to compute the consequent variations in London for every ten years from 1622 to 1800 ; which he afterwards compared with actual observed variations , and in every case the error between the two is very inconsiderable .
In the second edition of my Essay on Magnetic Attractions , I have made a similar comparison , not by assuming the place of the pole , but by computing it from the dip and variation ; and the errors or differences in this case , though certainly not so small , are still by no means considerable .
In the Article " MAGNETISM " in the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana , I have 671 made similar computations for Paris and Copenhagen , the only two places besides London where observations are recorded for any length of time , and in both these the agreements between the computed and observed variations are still more approximate than in London .
Now it must be considered very extraordinary that such remarkable agreements as these should obtain in three places , between the computed and observed variations , through more than thirty degrees of change , or for a period of 170 years , if the hypothesis of a polar revolution were not founded in fact .
Assuming then , that , from whatever cause it may proceed , such a revolution does take place , how are we to account for those stationary , or nearly stationary , points of no variation to which reference has been made ?
The only reply to this question appears to be , that there is no determinate pole to which all needles point , but that every place has its own particular pole and polar revolution , governed probably by some one general but at present unknown cause .
Should this be the case , and the magnetic pole of any place be nearly coincident with the terrestrial pole , the line of no variation , notwithstanding the rotation , must remain nearly stationary ; but such stationary position is impossible where the variation is considerable , although the change ought to be very slow on this hypothesis while it is passing through its maximum .
I have offered these few remarks without any intention of their being considered as illustrations of a particular theory .
My only object has been in this undertaking to give an exact representation , as far as it was possible , of the present state of terrestrial magnetism , and in this I have every reason to hope I have succeeded .
In the performance of this task , which has required several months of close application , I have been greatly assisted by my son , who has executed with great accuracy the whole of the graphical part , and aided in the comparison of many thousand observations ; and I shall be most happy if our joint labour should furnish the requisite data for either a present or future development of those mysterious laws which govern the magnetism of the terrestrial globe , an object as interesting in philosophy as it is important in navigation .

P.S. Since this paper was read , and the globe and chart referred to in this article were drawn , Captain Ross has returned from his long and adventurous voyage .
It will be seen by a reference to the polar chart , that , although I was enabled to lay down the curves of equal variation to within a few degrees of their point of concurrence , yet they are all terminated before arriving at it , for want of sufficient data .
These are now supplied ; and it is very gratifying to me , as I hope it may be also to Captain Ross and to Commander JAMES Ross , to find that the very spot in which they have found the needle perpendicular , --that is , the pole itself , -is precisely that point on my globe and chart in which , by supposing all the lines to meet , the several curves would best preserve their unity of character , both separately , and conjointly as a system .
By some delay in engraving the chart , I amn able to add to it the exact place of the pole , as obtained from the numerous and admirably arranged observations of Commander Ross , which I have had the pleasure and satisfaction of examining , and which I hope , in the ensuing session , will be laid before the Royal Society , 673
