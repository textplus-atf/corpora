" On the Radiation of Heat from the Moon .
" By the EARL OF ROSSE , F.R.S. Received May 27 , 1869 .
The following experiments on Lunar Radiant Heat were undertaken with the view of ascertaining whether with more powerful and more suitable means than those previously employed by others , with little or no success , it would be possible to detect and estimate the amount of heat which reaches the earth 's surface from the moon .
436 [ May 27 , Professor Piazzi Smyth had conducted a series of experiments on the Peak of Teneriffe with a thermopile , but apparently without any means of concentrating the moon 's heat beyond the ordinary polished metal cone .
Melloni had employed a glass lens of considerable diameter ( I believe about three feet ) ; but as glass absorbs rays of low refrangibility , it was not so well adapted to concentrate heat as a metallic mirror .
In the following experiments the point sought to be determined was , in what proportions the moon 's heat consists of ( 1 ) That coming from the interior of the moon , which will not vary with the phase .
( 2 ) That which falls from the sun on the moon 's surface , and is at once reflected regularly and irregularly .
( 3 ) That which , falling from the sun on the moon 's surface , is absorbed , raises the temperature of the moon 's surface , and is afterwards radiated as heat of low refrangibility .
The apparatus consisted of a thermopile of four elements , the faces half an inch square , on which all the moon 's heat which falls on the large speculum of the 3-foot telescope is concentrated , by means of a concave mirror of 31 inches aperture , 2'8 inches focal length .
As it was found difficult to compensate the effects of unequal radiation on the anterior face of the pile , by exposing the posterior face also of the same pile to radiation from the sky , during the later experiments ( beginning with March 23rd ) two piles were used , and the following was the form of apparatus adopted .
DE is the large mirror of the telescope ; FG the two small concave mirrors of 3k inches aperture , and 2'8 inches focal length , fixed in the plane of the image formed by the large mirror D E. The two thermopiles are placed respectively in the foci of F and G , their anterior faces shielded from wind and other disturbing causes by polished brass cones , and their posterior faces kept at a nearly uniform temperature by means of brass caps filled with water .
The thermopiles and accompanying mirrors are supported by a bar screwed temporarily on the mouth of the tube .
Two wires are connected with the two poles of each pile ; and the ends of the wires are connected , two and two , close to the galvanometer , in such a manner that a given amount of heat on the anterior face of one pile will produce a deviation equal in amount , and opposite in direction , to that produced by an equal amount of heat on the anterior face of the other pile .
Thomson 's Reflecting Galvanometer was the one used .
2K This apparatus has not yet had a fair trial , as I was unable to obtain from Messrs. Elliot a pile ready made of similar dimensions to that which I already possessed .
That which they sent had only one-fourth the required area of face .
The following is a summary of the results:-8 Id ?

The annexed diagram will show approximately the rate at which the moon 's light increases and diminishes with its phases as deduced from formula ( a ) ; and the ringed dots with the accompanying Roman figures ( for reference ) give the quantity of the moon 's heat as determined by observation on different nights .

'no and calculated quantities of heat , the results suggest to us that the law of variation of the moon 's heat will probably be found not to differ much from that of the moon 's light .
It therefore follows that not more than a small part of the moon 's heat can come from the first of the three sources already mentioned .
With the view of ascertaining what proportion of the sun 's heat does not leave the moon 's surface until after it has been absorbed , some readings of the galvanometer were taken on four different nights near the time of full moon , with a disk of thin plate glass in front of the face of each pile ; and the deviation was about six or eight divisions .
As the glass screens were examined with care for dew after removal on each night , and none was perceived except on one occasion , the probable percentage of the moon 's heat which passes through plate glass is 8 , or rather less .
Few experiments appear to have been made on the absorptive power of glass for the sun 's rays ; but , from the best data that I have been able to obtain , I find that probably about 80 per cent. pass through glass .
The greater part of the moon 's heat which reaches the earth appears , therefore , to have been first absorbed by the lunar surface .
It now appeared desirable to verify this result , as far as possible , by determining by direct experiment the proportion which exists between the heat which reaches the earth from the sun and from the moon .
If we start with the assumption that the sun 's heat is composed of two portions , the luminous rays , whose amount = L , and the non-luminous , , , , , = 0 , also that the moon 's light consists of two corresponding portions , L ' , 0f , the luminous not being absorbed , and the non-luminous being entirely absorbed in their passage through glass , then L. L+o 0. .
L+O 10 .
L+0 L+O -'.08 ; L'+0 ; O ' Substituting for , its generally received value ( 800,000 ) , we have L'+O ' I L+O 80(,000b ) Owing to the extremely uncertain state of the weather , only one series of eighteen readings was obtained for the determination of the sun 's heat .
A beam of sunlight was thrown , by means of a plane mirror , alternately on and off a plate of polished metal with a hole 175 inch in diameter .
At a short distance behind this the pile was placed .
The deviation thus found was connected with that previously found for Full Moon by using the deviation produced by a vessel of hot water as a term of comparison .
The relative amount of solar and lunar radiation thus found was 89819 : 1 , ... ... ( c ) which is quite as near that given by ( b ) as we could expect when we consider the roughness of the data .
As a further confirmation of the correctness of the two rough approximations to the value of the ratio existing between the sun 's and the moon 's radiant heat already given , the subject was investigated from a purely theoretical point of view .
It was assumed ( 1 ) That the quantity of heat leaving the moon at any instant may without much error be considered the same as that falling on it at that instant .
( 2 ) That the absorptive power of our atmosphere is the same for lunar and solar heat .
( 3 ) That , as was already assumed in obtaining formula ( a ) , the moon is a smooth sphere not capable of reflecting light regularly .
Then the heat which leaves the moon in all directions = quantity which falls on the moon = , -55 of the quantity which falls on the earth from the sun *o =K .

( d ) In the above , the proportion between the areas of surface presented by the moon and earth to the sun is taken = 13'55 , and the angle subtended by the earth at the moon ==1 ? ?

The value of the readings of the galvanometer was determined by comparison with those obtained by using a vessel of hot water coated with shellac and lampblack varnish as a source of heat .
The vessel was of tin , circular , and subtended the same angle at the small concave reflectors as the large mirror of the telescope .
It was thus found that ( the radiating power of the moon being supposed equal to that of the lampblack surface and the earth 's atmosphere not to influence the result ) a deviation of 90 for full moon appears to indicate an elevation of temperature through 500 ?
Fahr.* In deducing this result allowance has been made for the imperfect absorption of the sun 's rays by the lunar surface .
In the present imperfect state of these observations it would be premature to discuss them at greater length ; but as some months must elapse before any more complete series can be obtained , and the present results are sufficient to show conclusively that the moon 's heat is capable of being detected with certainty by the thermopile , I have thought it best to send this account to the Royal Society ; and I shall be most happy to receive suggestions as to improvements in the method of working , and as to the direction in which it may be most desirable to carry on future experiments .
