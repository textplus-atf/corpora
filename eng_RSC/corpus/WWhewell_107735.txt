crystal is represented by a symbol indicative of the laws from which it results ; the symbol , by varying the indices only , may be made to represent any law whatever : and by means of these indices , and of the primary angles of the substance , we obtain a general formula , expressing the dihedral angle contained between any one plane resulting from crystalline laws , and any other .
In the same manner we can find the angle contained between any two edges of the derived crystal .
Conversely , knowing the plane or dihedral angles of any crystal , and its primary form , we can by a direct and general process deduce the laws of decrement according to which it is constituted .
The same formula are capable of being applied to the investigation of a great variety of properties of crystals of various kinds , as will be shown in the sequel .
We shall begin with the consideration of the rhomboid , and the figures deduced from it ; and we shall afterwards proceed to other primary forms . ?
i. The Rhomboid .
, .
Let there be a rhomboid , A a , Fig. .
divided into a number of small equal rhomboids by planes parallel to its faces .
Let afly one of the points of division of each of its three upper edges be taken , as P , Q , R ; and let a plane pass through these three points P , Q , R. Let the small rhomboids which are above this plane be removed , so as to leave a uniform assemblage of cavities .
Then , the remaining surface PQ R , being composed of the trihedral angles of small rhomboids , if we suppose the small rhomboids to become smaller than the least distinguishable magnitude , the surface PQR will appear a plane , And if we suppose these rhomboids to represent the 88 primary form of a crystalline body , PQR will be a secondary surface deduced from a certain arrangement of these primary elements .
Let the three upper edges of the rhomboid , A x , Ay , A z , be considered as three axes of co-ordinates ; and let the corresponding co-ordinates be x , y , z. We can then express the plane PQR by means of these co-ordinates .
If , for instance , we consider an edge of the small rhomboid as unity , and if AP , AQ , ARE contain respectively 9 , 6 , and 3 of these edges , the equation to the plane P , Q , R , will be 9+ +6 3 and if the numbers of small rhomboids in AP , AQ , ARE be respectively h , k , I , the equation to the plane will be T++-T 1 .
If h , k , I be multiplied by any common quantity m , so that the equation becomes m+WAm= I , or ++X_m mh mk^ m'h T ?
I it is clear that the plane PQR will continue parallel to its former position , and may be considered as deduced from the same law as before .
Hence it appears , that in the equation h+ --Y + =m , the quantity m does not serve to determine the position or law of formation of the plane , and may be any whatever .
If we make m o , the plane P R , still continuing parallel to its former position , will pass through the point A ; and as we have to consider only the angles made by planes and their intersections , we may in such calculations suppose all our planes to pass through this point A. Since therefore the direction of the plane PQR is competely determined by the three quantities h , k , , we may represent it by writing those three quantities thus ( ; k ; ) ; * or , if the equation be px 4qy + rz = m , we may represent the plane by the symbol ( p ; q ; r ) .
s. According to the law of symmetry which prevails in the production of crystalline forms , if one edge or face of the primary solid be modified in any manner , the other homologous edges and faces will be similarly modified .
Hence , if one plane exist , other corresponding planes must also exist , and these we may call co-existent planes to the first .
Thus if we have a plane PQ R , Fig. 2 , and if we take AP = AQ , and AQ ' = AP , we must also have a plane P'Q R : for the edges Az , Ay being perfectly similarly situated , if one of them be affected in any manner , the other must be similarly affected .
Hence , if we have a plane ( p ; q ; r ) , we must have one ( q ; p ; r ) .
The same is also true of z ; and by considering this in the same manner , it will be seen that the plane ( p ; q ; r ) has the following coexistent planes ( q ; P ; r ) ( r ; q ; p ) ( p ; r ; q ) ( q ; r ; p ) ( r ; p ; q ) .
That is , there are all the permutations that can be made by altering the arrangement of the three quantities p , q , r ; that the one which stands first in order being always the coefficient of , the second that of y , and the third that of z. These six planes may be represented by a single symbol ( p q , r ) ; it being understood , that when quantities are only separated by commas , they are to be taken in all the ways in which they can be permuted .
In the same manner ( p , q ; r ) may represent the two planes ( p , q ; r ) ( q , ; r ) , the permutations not extending to r , which is separated by a semicolon .
In the case of the rhomboid , however , the permutations always include all the three quantities , in consequence of the similarity of its three edges .
4 .
We have hitherto considered only the planes produced by cutting off the upper angle ; but we may represent in the same manner the plane produced by truncating any other angle .
It may be observed that the angles x , y , z , fig. s , which are separated from the superior angle A by an edge , are called lateral angles .
The angles x , y ' , i ' , which are separated from A by a diagonal , are called inferior angles .
Let pq r , fig. s , be a plane produced by a truncation at the lateral angles : xp , xq , xr being h , k , I respectively .
Produce rA beyond A , and take AP xp , AQ xq , AR= xr ; then the plane PQR will be parallel to pq r , and may be taken instead of it .
Now it is manifest that the equation to this plane is I++ and therefore its symbol is ; A ; .
Or if =q =- , r= -t , the equation is pr 4+ qy + rz= m , and the symbol ( -p ; q ; r ) .
Hence a plane which cuts off the lateral solid angles is distinguished by having one negative index .
In the same manner let pq r , fig. 4 , cut off an inferior angle x ' , so that xp h , x q k , z ' r l ; and taking 9 !
AP=x'p , AQ = x ' q , ARE = x ' r , the plane PQR will be parallel to pq r , and its equation will be x 3/ Z_ h -T -T = I ; or px qy rZ = l : and its symbol ( h-- ; , o ; or ; q r ; ) .
Hence a plane which cuts off the inferior solid angles is distinguished by having two negative indices .
It may be observed , that in both these cases the coexistent planes are given by taking the permutations of p , q , r ; and may be represented as before by ( -p , q , r ) and ( p , q ; r ) .
There will in each case be six ; two for each angle .
5 .
If one of the quantities AP , AQ , ARE , or h , k , I , in any of these cases become infinite , we shall have a truncation of an edge of the rhomboid .
Thus if AP , in fig. 2 , become infinite , we have a plane cutting off the terminal edge Ax , fig. 5 .
And since h is infinite , if q= -- , r -= - , the equation of this plane is qy + rzx ; and its symbol ( o ; q ; r ) .
In the same manner , making x ' r infinite in fig. 4 , we have , for a plane truncating the lateral edge x'y , an equation px qy i , and a symbol ( p ; q ; o ) .
The terminal edges of Ax , Ay , Az , are not similarly affected with the lateral edges xy ' , y ' z , zx ' , xy , yz ' , ' x. 6 .
Instead of supposing the secondary faces to be produced by removing a part of the rhomboid A a , we may conceive , with HAUY , that this larger figure is composed by adding successive layers of the small component rhomboids to a rhomboidal nucleus ; and that the secondary faces are produced by supposing the magnitude of these layers to decrease according to any law .
And it will : be easy to show 92 what symbols , according to the notation here proposed , correspond to the different laws in the old system .
Thus A decrement on the superior angle is expressed by ( p , q , q ) , A which corresponds to HAUY'S symbol P. qq On a lateral angle by ( -p , q , q ) corresponding to EP ; On an inferior angle by ( p , -q , q ) corresponding to ep On a terminal edge by ( o , q , r ) corresponding to Bq ; Iq On a lateral edge by ( p , --q , o ) corresponding to G rp An intermediary decrement thus ( p , q , r ) , corresponding to ( AP B C ) and ( p , - , r ) corresponding to ( o0P D F-f ) .
The symbols of the faces of the primary form are ( p , o , o ) .
7.There is in fact , however , no necessity to suppose the secondary forms to be produced either by truncation of a primary one , or by addition to it .
If we suppose that the small rhomboids , of which Aa was assumed to be made up , are continued through all the space round the point A , we may conceive a plane to pass among these , parallel to PQ R. And this plane will be represented by ( p ; q ; r ) independently of any consideration of the rhomboid Aa or the point A ; for if we take any point , and from it draw lines to the plane , parallel to the three edges A x , A y , A z , these three lines will be as , , , And any other plane may simip ' q ' r larly pass among the small rhomboids , and be represented by ( p ' ; q ' ; r ' ) .
And if we obtain any solid figure contained by such planes , we may , by supposing those of the small rhomboids which lie without this plane to be removed , have a proper representation of a secondary crystalline form constituted by the aggregation of primary ones .
Before we proceed to the calculations founded on this mode of viewing the subject , we may observe , that by increasing or diminishing the three indices p , q , r in any ratio , the plane representedby them is not altered .
Thus ( p ; q ; r ) ( n ; nq ; nr ) ( P ; I ) , &amp;c. are the same plane .
Hence ( p ; ; q ; q ) is the same as ( P ; -1 ; 1 ) ( p ; p ; o ) as(1 ; i ; o ) ; and the primary faces are ( 1 , , o ) .

will be p2 q2 r2 -(q + pr 4+ qr ) cos. a. We shall take examples of the use of these formula .

A variety of other rhomboids may be produced in this and other substances by other laws .
In all cases , if two of the indices of the symbol be equal , as ( p , q , q ) , there will only : That this law is what HAUY calls a decrement on the inferior angles of 4 in breadth to 5 in height , and is in his notation represented by the symbol e. 5 The angles obtained in the text differ slightly from these given by HAUY in consequence of his having assumed the angle of the primary rhomboid of carbonate of lime , = 1040.28'.4 " , for the convenience of using the cosine .
4 95 be three coexistent planes ; and if each of these planes be repeated , we shall have three pairs of parallel planes containing a rhomboid .
If the three indices in the symbol ( p , q , r ) be all different , we shall have six planes , and repeating each of these , we shall have a dodecahedron consisting of two six-sided pyramrids .
To this case belongs the following example : Ex. 2 .

By other laws we should find dther dodecahedrons and their angles .
But in many cases we have two laws , producing two sets of faces , and it may be required to find the angle between those of one set and of the other .

We proceed now to the inverse problem ; having given the angles of the secondary crystal to find the law of its planes .
And we shall first suppose the secondary form to be a rhomboid ; in which case , as has already been observed , two of the indices in the symbol are equal .

It is required to find according to what law we shall have a rhomboid similar to the primary one .

The other indicates a decrement by 2 in height on the inferior angle , which it appears gives a rhomboid identical with the primary rhomboid .
11 PROP Knowing the lateral angles made , at the terminal edges , by the planes of any bipyramidal dodecahedron to find the symbols , If we have planes ( p , q , r ) they will generally form a bipyramidal dodecahedron , and the six angles at the edges of each pyramid will be alternately greater and less .
If p , q , r be the order of magnitude of the indices , p being the greatest , the order of the faces will be that represented in fig. ( see hereafter the section on the arrangement of faces ) .
Hence faces occur in the order ( p ; q ; r ) ( q ; p ; r ) ( r ; p ; q ) &amp;c. : and if 0 be the angle of the two first , and 0 ' of the next , we shall have 2pq + r2(p+ q+ 2zp r+2 qr ) cos. a p7+4 q. r-2 ( p q+pr+q r ) cos. a2qr +p-(q.+ r1+ 2p q+ 2pr ) cos. -cos .

To eliminate in these equations would lead to expressions of four dimensions , and it will generally be simpler to find q and r by trial .
If we assume for p any number , as 12 ; q and r , which generally bear to it very simple ratios , will in most cases be whole numbers , and may be found by a few trials .
And if the ratios of q and r to p involve quantities which are not divisors of 12 , still the trials made on this supposition will indicate nearly the values of q and r ; and by trying other values for p , we may obtain them accurately .
If two of the indices , as q , r be negative ; the order of the faces will be ( p ; r ; q)(r ; p ; -q)(-q ; p ; -r ) , &amp;c. and the rest of the process will be the same as before .

To find what laws will give prisms parallel to the axis of the primary rhomboid .
For this purpose the planes must be parallel to the axis ; and the equation of a plane must be consistent with the equations of the axis , which are y -x , Z-= Let ( p ; q ; r ) be the plane ; . .
px -+ qy +rzo is the equation to it , supposing it to pass through the origin ; and since y= x , z x ; we have p xq x+r x=o. .

To find the symbol of a plane which truncates any edge of a given form .
Let two faces ( p ; q ; r ) ( p ' ; q ' ; r ' ) meet , and let ( P ; Q ; R , ) be a plane which truncates the edge formed by their intersection : the plane must be parallel to this intersection ; and the equations to the intersection must be consistent with the equation Pr +Qy+Rz o. Now for the intersection we have pz +qy+r z : o , p'x ' q'y + r'z o : whence ( pq-p'q ) = ( q r ' q'r ) , ( r -p r ' ) ( q r-q'r)y .
Multiply Px+ Qy +Rz=o by ( q r'-q'r ) and substitute , and we have P ( q r'-r ) 4.Q ( p r--p r ' ) + R(p q'-'q)= o. And if P , Q , R fulfil this condition , ( P ; Q ; R ) will be a plane truncating the edge as required .
15 .
PROP .
To find the symbol of a plane which truncates an edge of any secondary rhomboid .
This is a particular case of last Prop. when instead of ( p ; q ; r ) ( p ' ; q ; r ' ) , the planes are ( p ; q ; q)(qp ; q ) .
Hence the equation of condition becomes P ( q2 -p q ) + Q(q2 p q ) +t R(p2 q).)= o or Pq+ Q q-R ( p + q ) o Hence if R q , P+Q =p -q , and with this condition , ( P ; Q ; q ) is the plane required .
Ex. Required the planes which truncate the edges of the rhomboid produced by the law ( 3 , -i ) .
Herep +q 2 ; .
the values which may be given to 100 P , Q are any number whose sum is 2 .
Thus ( 1 , 1 , i ) ( 2 , o,1 ) are truncating faces .
( This rhomboid truncated by these two planes occurs iv .
HAUY'S Chaux Carbonatee Progressive .
Fig. 41 .
) The plane thus determined will always be parallel to the intersection of the two planes ; but in order that it may truncate the edge , it must meet both of them on the really existing part of each plane .
This condition is easily introduced in each particular case .
16 .
In order to express , by means of the symbols already introduced , any crystal whatever , we may write down the symbols of the faces by which it is bounded ; indicating by the punctuation the permutations which are allowed .
It will be convenient also to mark the number of the faces which arise from these permutations .
In the rhomboid , when all the three indices are different , this number will be six .
When two are alike , it it will be three .
Thus ( 6 ) ( p , q , r ) may indicate that the crystal has six faces arising from the law expressed by ( p , q , r ) and ( 3 ) ( p , p , r ) may represent a crystal with three faces arising from the law ( p , p , r ) ; which is what would , according to HAUY , be called a decrement on an angle at the summit .
It often happens that faces in a crystal are repeated ; that is , that there are faces parallel to one another , one of which may be considered as a repetition of the other .
In that case we may distinguish them by placing a2 before them as a multiplier .
Thus 2 ( s)(p , p , r ) indicates a rhomboid produced by repeating each of the three faces represented by ( p , p , r ) .
This is in fact the mode in which a rhomboid is always produced .
In the same manner 2 ( 6 ) ( p , q , r ) is the 101 symbol of a dodecahedron , which results from repeating each of the six planes ( p , q , r ) . ? . .
The Quadrangular Prism .
17 .
The quadrangular prism may be right or oblique , and its base may be a square , a rectangle , a rhombus , or a parallelogram .
But in all cases we may take one of its angles , and make that the origin of co-ordinates ; and taking two of our co-ordinates along two edges of the base , and the third along the length .
of the prism , we shall be able to express the secondary planes in the same manner as in the case of the rhomboid .
There will however be some additional considerations to introduce , since the edges of the prism may be of different magnitudes ; and its angles not being symmetrical like those of a rhomboid , we shall no longer have the same coexistent planes which we had in the former case .
In order to introduce the first consideration , let x and y , fig. 6 , be the co-ordinates in the direction of the edges of the base , and z in that of the length of the prism .
Let the space bounded by the co-ordinate planes be filled with small similar prisms , and let their edges in the directions , y , z be a , b , c respectively .
Let a secondary plane P QR be formed , by taking away h prisms along the edge x , k along y , and I along z ; then the lengths of AP , AQ , ARE will be h a , k b , Ic respectively ; and the equation to the plane will be +y z+ Ia kb c-l If we call , A ; B ; C , C ; we shall have the angle between any two planes by the formula , Art .
8 ; putting for a , y , and for d , e , f , their values .
But if we make = q , = r , ( p ; q ; r ) may still be taken for the symbol of the plane .
In this case -- , - , are the co-efficients of the equation to the plane , and are to be used for A , B , C in calculating the angles which the planes make with each other .
We shall use the following terms ; a rhombic prism is one whose base is a rhombus : an oblique rhombic prism , fig , 8 , is one in which the sides are not at right angles to the base , the angles of the sides , as BAz , CA z being equal .
A doubly oblique prism , fig. 7 , is one in which the angles of the sides at the base BA z , CA z are unequal .
Prisms are called square or rectangular when their bases are so : and when the base is a parallelogram with unequal sides , and angles not right angles , the prism is called oblique-angled .
Besides these we have a prism which we may call the oblique rectangular prism , * fig. 9 , in which besides the two rectangular ends we have two sides , as cz and the opposite one , also rectangles .
i. The doubly-oblique Prism , fig. 7 .
18 .
In this , since the angles are all different , no one of the solid angles ( A , B , C , D ) is similar to another .
Hence if a plane be formed on one of the angles , there is no plane necessarily formed on another angle ; consequently a plane as ( p ; q ; r ) or ( p ; --q ; -r ) does not necessarily imply any coexistent plane , and the symbol is to be written with the mark ( ; ) between the indices , to show that no permutations are allowed .
Let the edges of the subtractive prisms in last article be a , in the direction AB , b in the direction AC , c in the direction Az .
Then putting _P , q- , _for A , B , C in the formula , Art .
8 , we shall have the angles made by secondary planes .
Conversely , knowing the angles made by secondary planes we may determine A , B , C , as before , and when we have found in crystals the same substance , various values of A , B , C , we have q _Bb r Cc p Aa ' p " a a and a , b , c are to be assumed so that q:p and r : p may be numerical ratios as simple as possible .
2 .
The oblique rhombic Prism , fig. 8 .
19 .
In this case the angles z AB , z AC , and the sides AB , AC are equal ; and consequently the two faces z AB , z AC are symmetrical ; and whatever secondary plane is formed with reference to one , we must have a co-existent plane corresponding to the other .
Hence , if we have a plane ( p ; q ; r ) we must have a plane ( q p ; r ) and we may express both these by the symbol ( p , q ; r ) the ( , ) indicating that the co-ordinates x and y may be exhanged , z remaining the same .
And this is true whether p , q , r be positive or negative .
Here having found p , q , and r we have h a , k a , Ic , because a and b are equal , and their values are to be determined as before .
3 .
The oblique rectangular Prism , fig. 9 .
2o .
Here the solid angles A and C are similar in all respects , A being contained by two right angles BAC , CAz and the angle BA z , and C by the angles DCA , AC o , o CD equal to them .
Hence whatever plane be formed on A , we must have a coexistent plane on C , agreeing with it , except o04 that the ordinate in AC is in the opposite direction : that is ( p ; q ; r ) ( p ; -q ; r ) are co-existent planes .
These may be included in the formula ( p ; + q ; r ) .
4 .
The right oblique-angled Prism , fig. lo .
1i .
It is obvious that the opposite angles A and D of the base of this prism are similar in all respects ; and with any secondary plane formed on one of them , we must have a co-existent similar plane on the other .
That is , we must have a second plane , when x and y are negative , as they were positive in the first .
Hence ( p ; q ; r ) ( -p ; -q r ) are coexistent planes ; and we may express them thus ( +p ; ?
q , r ) it being understood in such symbols that the upper signs are taken together , and the lower together .
5 .
The right rhombic Prism , fig. 10 .
22 .
Here , the opposite angles A , D are similar , and also the adjacent sides .
Hence with a plane ( p ; q ; r ) we have co-existent planes ( -p ; -q ; r ) ( q ; p ; r)( ; p ; r ) .
These may be included in the symbol ( ?
p , +q ; r ) the upper signs being taken together as before , and p , q being permutable as is indicated by the comma .
6 .
The right rectangular Prism , fig. 11 .
23 .
Here the four angles A , B , C , D are similar .
Hence ( p ; q ; r ) has co-existent planes ( -p ; q ; r ) ( p ; -q ; r ) ( --p ; -q ; r ) These may be included in the formula ( tp ; q ; r ) the signs being taken in horizontal pairs , 7 .
The right square Prism .
24 .
In this case , besides the co-existent planes which we have in the last figure , we shall have those which arise from considering that the sides AB , AC are symmetrical , that is p and q are permutable .
Here the symbol is ( + p , +q ; r ) this will give eight secondary faces .

The Cube .
25 .
This differs from the last in having the edge in the direction z similar to those in x and y. Hence p , q , r may be permuted and the symbol is ( + p , q , r ) which gives 24 secondary faces.* There is no necessity to vary the sign of r , for the plane ( p ; q ; r ) is the same as ( -p ; q ; r ) . ?
s. The regular Tetrahedron and Octahedron .
26 .
In this and other cases where the figure is bounded by more than three planes we shall make three of the primary faces co-ordinate planes , and the remaining primary faces will be expressed by different symbols .
Also the co-existent planes will be differently represented accordingly as they are on one angle or another , and we shall in each case have to determine the different forms which will thus occur .
Let Axy z , fig. 12 , be a regular tetrahedron , and let A x , Ay , Az be three co-ordinates .
Let a plane pqr be formed on the angle A ; then , since all the angles are symmetrical , we must have a coexistent plane at any other angle , as x. LetAph , , Aq k , A r ; and let wP h , Q=k , xR - ; it is required to find the equation to the plane PQR .
Draw xM and y K parallel to PQ and we have , ifA x= a , xK-=-x y.- ; --a ; AK-=a(1-+ .
AlsoAM AAy .
A= kT Similarly if xN be parallel to PR , we shall find AN a Hence the equation of the plane NxM is a'(a= or NO+(+-4)L+(4-+)z= OkT +( T-T k Yt + T ) .
And the symbol of this plane will be | ; T- ; -I IL\ And the plane PQR is parallel to Nx M , and will have the am symbol .
If ph-P , T r.q , = the symbol of the plane PQR will be ( p ; p~ q ; p r ) In the same way we shall have at the anglesy and z , planes ( q--p ; ; q--r)and ( p -r ; r q--r ; r ) .
But the edges Ax , Ay , Az are also similar , and -therefore p , q , r may be permuted in any manner .
Hence we have these co-existent planes ( p ; q p , p q , p pr ) , ( q --p , q , q -r ) , ( rp , rq , r ) 107 It being understood that in each parenthesis the indices which are separated by commas may undergo any permutation .
The first symbol ( p , q , r ) gives 6 planes , and the three others also 6 each , making in all 24 .
If the primary form be known to be a regular tetrahedron , it is evident that the first symbol ( p , q , r ) must be understood as implying also the rest .
But in order to express all the planes we may include them in one symbol thus q( , q , r)(p , p -q p-r ) &amp; c the &amp;c. implying the coexistent planes .
27 .
PROP .
To determine the symbol of the planes which truncate the edges of a tetrahedron .
The plane truncating the edge x is ( o ; q , r ) : and hence by last article the general symbol includes the planes ( o0q , r ) , ( q , qq -r ) , ( r , r-q , r ) which gives 12 planes .
We omit ( o , -qr ) , which is identical with ( o , q , r ) .
If q=r the planes are expressed by ( o , q , q ) , which gives 3 planes ; but in order to truncate the six edges , each is used twice , and the symbol is 2 ( ) ( o , q , q ) .
The regular octahedron is bounded by the same 4 planes as the tetrahedron , each being used twice ; and its symbol is 2 ( 4 ) ( 1 , o , o ) ( ,1 , i ) } .
Its edges are also parallel to the edges of the tetrahedron , each being used twice .
And any plane which can be deduced .
from the octahedron , may with equal simplicity be deduced from the tetrahedron .
28 .
PROP .
In the regular tetrahedron to find the angle contained by planes ( o , 1 , 1 ) .
loThe plane angles of the tetrahedron are 60 ?
; and hence , to find its dihedral angles , we have to find the angle of an equilateral spherical triangle whose sides are 60 ? .
If a be this angle , we have.- .
cos. a= cotan .

0 =..3 'cos .
o because cos. = - .
22 COS. 3 Hence the angle of the planes is a right angle .
And in the same manner the angles made by the other planes will be right angles .
The figure will be a cube bounded by the 3 planes ( o , 1 , 1 ) twice repeated .
Irregular Tetrahedrons and Octahedrons .
29 .
If we have an octahedron composed of two right quadrilateral pyramids , similar and equal , set base to base , we shall call this a right octahedron ; and it will be termed square , rectangular , or rhombic , when the base is so .
The tetrahedron , from which the right rectangular octahedron is derived , may be called the direct symmetrical tetrahedron ; and that from which the right rhombic octahedron is derived , may be called the inverse symmetrical tetrahedron , on account of properties which will be explained immediately .
Also , all the planes which can be derived from the octahedrons , may be derived more simply from the corresponding tetrahedrons ; and we shall find the coexistent planes , and the angles made by the faces , in the same manner as in the previous cases .
109 4 .
Directsymmetrical Tetrahedron and rectangulr Octahedron .
so .
Let A xy z , fig. 1s , be a tetrahedron , and let all its edges be bisected , and the bisections joined by lines drawn in the faces .
We shall thus have an octahedron DEFGHK .
If we consider EFHK as the common base of the two pyramids of which the octahedron is composed , when EFHK is a rectangle , the octahedron is called rectangular ; and when EFHK is a square , the octahedron is called square .
Let EFHK be a rectangle , the octahedron being a right one .
Then all the faces of the octahedron will be isosceles triangles , of which DEF , DHK , GFE , GHK will be equal to each other , and the other four also equal to each othero Also , it is easily seen that the triangle Ay z has its sides double of those of EFG , and is similar to it ; and similarly xy z has its sides double of KHG .
Therefore the two triangles Ay z , xy z are both isosceles , ( y z being the base , ) and are equal in every respect ; and similarly yAx and zAx are isosceles triangles equal in every respect .
Hence the solid angles at y and z are equal in every respect , and also those at A and x. And a plane passing through Ax and through the middle of yz would divide the tetrahedron symmetrically into two equal portions .
Hence we have called this the direct symmetrical tetrahedron .
We may suppose the solid angle A to be filled with parallelepipeds , the planes of which are parallel to the planes A xy , A xz , Ay z , in the same manner as the solid angle A , fig. .
And by removing these parallelepipeds according to any law , as in fig. i , we obtain a secondary plane , of which the symbol and the equation may be known from the law .
l0o 11I si .
But since the solid angles at A and at x are symmetrical , for every plane at A we shall have a co-existent plane at x , * of which we shall find the equation .
We may as before suppose A x , Ay , A z , to be co-ordinates , and with any plane pq r atA we shall have a co-existent plane PQR at x , such that x P , x Q , xR are equal to Ap , A q , Are respectively .
PRoP .
The symbol of pqr being ( p ; q ; r ) to find the symbol of PQR .
Let the small component parallelepipeds have the edge in direction Ax a , and the edges in directions Ay , Az each =c ( these being equal ) .
Also , lqt Ax=n a , Ay = Az =n c.t And let the plane pqr be obtained by taking away h molecules in the direction A x , k in the direction Ay , and 1 in the direction A z. Therefore Ap h a , Aq=k c , A r_ Ic : and the equation to the plane pqr is h-a kc Ic = 1 ; or if.^^ , r= xyl P+ q7 +r i , the symbol of which is ( p ; q ; r ) .
Draw y 0 , xM parallel to PQ , meeting Ax and Ay .

Hence the equation to the plane xMN is k+( )nc+( )na orp-a + ( P-q ) Y+ ( p--r).Z=pn and the equations to planes pqr and PQR are xyz2a qcB qc 1 ; p+ ( p-q ) -+ ( p-r ) m and their symbols are ( p ; q ; r ) , ( p p -q ; p--r ) .
Also the edges Ay , Az are symmetrical ; and hence we have two other co-existent planes ( p ; r ; q ) ( p r ; p q ) .
These are included in the formula { ( p ; q , r ) ( p ; p-q , p-r ) } The solid angles aty and z are also symmetrical ; and a plane being supposed to be formed at y as before , we must have a co-existent plane at z. Let p ' q ' r ' be a plane cutting off the angle y , and b being the edge of a molecule in the direction y z , let p ' , y q ' , y r ' =h b , k c , Ic respectively , and let z P ' , Q ' , z R ' =yp ' , y ' , y r ' respectively .
Then p ' q ' r ' and P ' Q ' R ' will be co-existent planes ; and the condition of their co-existence is included in the preceding symbol .
The quantities a , b , c are as n a , n b , n c , that is as A x , yx and Ay .
Or , referring to the octahedron in fig. s , they are as FH , FE , and FD .
The square Octahedron .
32 .
When EFHK , fig. 13 , is a square , A.x , yz will be equal , and the solid angles at y and z will be symmetrical to those at A and x , and will be similarly affected .
Hence for a plane at A there will be co-existent planes at y and z. PROP .
To find the symbols of co-existent planes in this case , If we take z P ' , Q ' , z R ' , =yp , y q ' , y r ' , = Ap , A q , Are respectively , we shall , as in last article , find the equation of the planes p ' q ' r ' , P ' Q ' R ' to be ( g ) na no nc ( j nc m and sincep p= , q k=- ) r P , these are equivalent to z m'n ( qx-r +qY+ ( q -p ) z_m ( ?

But we have also a co-existent plane ( p ; r ; q ) and therefore also ( r-q ; r ; r-p ) and ( rq rp ; r ) Hence in the square octahedron we have co-existent planes which may be included in this symbol { ( P ; r ) p -r , p-q ) ( q-r ; q , q--p ) ( r--q ; r , r--p ) All which are implied in ( p ; q ; r ) .

Hence , knowing the law by which a secondary face is derived from the octahedron , we can find its symbol .
The primary form is a square octahedron ; to find the symbol of the face 2E2 ( Ex. Zircon unibinaire , HAUY ) .
This plane is drawn cutting off the angle E , in such a manner th 1t the portions cut from E F , EG are double of those from EK , ED respectively ; and the section on the face EFG parallel to FG or to Ay .
Since the part cut from EG , parallel to A z , is double of that 114 from ED , parallel to xy , and is in the negative direction , ---- .
orp--q r. r Pq-p Also since the section is parallel to Ay we must have q=o .
Hence ( 2 ; o ; i ) is the symbol required .
And the co-existent planes are ( 2 ; O , 1 ( 2 ; 1 , 2 ) ( --1 ; ,2 , 1 ; 1 , i ) each of the parentheses gives two planes , and hence we have 8 arising from this law .

( PHILLIPS ) .
Hence the dihedral angle at Ax , which is ( X ) the angle of the planes EFK , FDH , is 95 40o ' And ( p , ) the angle at Ay is the angle of DEK , FEG , and is therefore the supplement of the angle of HFG , EFG , and it is therefore= 56 45 ' In the same manner ( y ) the dihedral angle at Az is 56 ? ?

It may be observed , that ( 2 ; o ; i ) is the side adjacent to the primary plane ( i ; o ; o ) ; and that we obtain sides adjacent to other faces by taking corresponding co-existent planes from the formuls in Art .

Thus the primary faces ( i ; o ; o ) have adjacent secondary faces ( 2 ; o ; 1 ) and ( 2 ; i ; o ) .
The primary faces ( o ; 1 ; o ) have adjacent ( ; 2 ; o ) and ( i ; 1 ; i ) The primary faces ( o ; o ; i ) have adjacent ( 1 ; o ; 2 ) and ( ; i ; -i ) The primary faces ( 1 1 ; r ) have adjacent ( 2 ; 1 ; 2 ) and ( 2 ; 2 ; 1 ) Here instead of(-i ; o : -- ) &amp;c. we have written ( 1 ; o ; 2 ) &amp;c. which represents the same plane . ? ?

Inverse symmetrical Tetrahedron and rhombic Octahedron .
36 .
Let A xy z , fig. 16 , be a tetrahedron ; and let its edges be bisected , and an octahedron formed as before .
In this octahedron , let EFHK be the rhombic base ; and the two 116 pyramids which compose the octahedron being right ones and equal , it is evidbnt that the four lines DE , EG , GH , HD will be equal , and the four lines DF , FG , GK , KD .
Now Ax is double of FH , and xy of HK .
Hence Ax=yz .
Similarly Ay x z , and Az= xy .
Hence it appears that the four triangles which form the sides of the tetrahedron have their sides equal respectively , and are therefore equal and similar .
Hence the four solid angles A , x , y , z , are contained by equal angles , and are symmetrical .
Thus the angles x Ay , yA z , zAx are equal to Ax z , y xz , A xy .
And this tetrahedron may be called an inverse symmetrical tetrahedron .
From the law of symmetry , whatever plane is formed at the angle A , we must have a coexistent plane at each of the angles x , y , z , the equal and opposite edges being similarly affected .

In the same manner the angle y gives a plane ( q-r ; q ; q-p ) and the angle za plane ( r -q ; r-p ; r ) .
Hence the co-existent planes are ( p ; q ; r ) , ( p ; p r ; p q ) , ( q r ; q ; q.-p ) , ( rq ; r-p ; r ) .
These four planes would truncate symmetrically the four faces of one of the pyramids which compose the octahedron , and planes parallel to them would truncate similarly the planes of the other pyramid .

Similarly , at y , we shall have a plane ( q -p ; ; r ) .
Also , since the edges Ax and Ay are symmetrical , we have a plane ( q ; p ; r ) .
And hence the co-existent planes are ( p ; q ; r ) ( p ; p q ; -r ) ( q -p ; q ; r ) ( q ; p ; r ) ( q ; q -p ; r ) ( p q ; p ; r ) .
Which may be included in the symbol { ( p q ; r ) ( p , p q ; -r ) ( q , q -p r ) ? ?

If we take a regular tetrahedron w xy z , fig. 20 , and from its centre of gravity A draw lines A w , A x , Ay , A z , the angles made by any two of these lines will be the same .
And by taking planes passing through any two of these lines we shall have six planes symmetrically disposed , each of which will make an angle of 120o with four others .
A figure bounded by planes parallel to these planes , each taken twice , and symmetrically disposed , will be the rhombic dodecahedron .
We may consider the three lines A x , Ay , Az as axes of co-ordinates ; and any plane pqr which cuts them must have co-existent planes cutting any two of them and A w. Also , as the lines Ax , Ay , Az are similar , in a plane ( p , q , r ) we may present the indices in any manner .

On the arrangement of secondary faces .
4 .
When crystals have faces determined by the laws considered in the preceding pages , they will have the form of polyhedrons bounded by polygons ; and in order to determine the dihedral angles , &amp;c. it will be necessary to know in what order the faces occur , and which are adjacent .
This may be done in the following manner : Let AI fig. 21 , be any parallelepiped of which the edges A x , Ay , Az are a , b , c. Let an ellipsoid be described , of which the center is I , touching three planes of this parallelepiped in D , E , F If we suppose any secondary plane , deduced from this parallelepiped , to be drawn so as to touch the ellipsoid in P , the situation of the points P will determine the position of the planes .
Let Ax+ By +Czm be the equation to the plane .
The equation to the ellipsoid will be ( a-x)1 ( b-y)z ( c-z)1 And that the plane may touch the ellipsoid , the differential co-efficients ( d ) and ( ) must be the same in both .
Hence tdy A ( a-x ) { dz A c2 ( a-.v ) dx B a " ( b-y)f , TXC ( c---z ) a--X b--yb a.x c-z Therefore a ---ar Aaz BbB 'Aa C-c And substituting in the equation to the ellipsoid we have ^(a --x+ ba+ C ^ ' ( a--7 i1 Aaax ( ( A^ az +B b4 + C^ c ) Bb e b..-y = ( Az d , +B b2 + cc ) Cd and c --z= V(Az2 a+ B2 ' b+~ c^2 ) Knowing the position of the points P for all the planes , we have the polyhedron , on the supposition that it is made such that the ellipsoid can be inscribed in it ; which is always possible by supposing the planes to move parallel to themselves till they touch it .
We shall see more clearly the position of the points P if we suppose it to be determined by angular distances like the longitude and latitude on a globe , assuming as the axis of the ellipsoid that about which the figure is symmetrical .

Here Ax=-Ay-=Az.= i , suppose IA be taken as the axis ; and a plane API being drawn , let the angle between this plane and IA x be called the longitude ( x ) of the point P ; and let the complement of AIP be called the latitude ( p ) of P. Let the co-ordinates of P be called X , Y , Z. Then the plane API has a point A , of which the co-ordinates are o , o , o ; a point I , of which the co-ordinates are i , i , i ; a.point P , of which the co-ordinates are X , Y , Z. Hence its equation is ( Y Z ) x+ ( Z -X)y + ( X -Y ) z=o .
And the equation to IA x is yz -o .

By these formula we may determine the arrangement of any set or sets of secondary faces .
Thus if we have a symbol ( p , q , r ) in which p &gt; q , q &gt; r ; we have 6 faces .
The expression for r sin. , is the same for all : hence they are all at the same distance from the summit B. And cos. x will be greater as p-q r is , or as sp(p+ q+ r ) is so .
Consequently the values of cos. x taken in order of magnitude will correspold to ( p ; q ; r ) ( q ; p ; r ) ( r ; p ; q ) .
The other three values be the same , viz. ( p ; r ; q ) ( q ; r ; p ) ( r ; q ; p ) ; and indicate longitudes on the other side of Ax .
The arrangement of the planes is represented in fig. 22 .
It is to be observed that as the order of the first index is p , q , r , beginning from x , the order of the second index is p , q , r beginning from y , and of the third p , q , r , beginning from z. 44 .

x will be greater as IO is greater , Let ( p ; q ; r ) be the sylnbol of the plane , and its equation will be +X y +r zaC And the values of IO , ON , NP , will be pa qb _ rc V ( p7 + q ; + r2 ) V ' p qp 2+f)+ Up ( + qp +4 r2 ) Hence tan .
x will be greater as q is greater ; or as is pa P greater ; because a and b are constant for the same substance .
Also sin. pis greater as PN is greater ; that is , as ( ?

124 And hence we may arrange the faces in the order of their longitude and latitude .
We might in the same manner find the position of the planes for other primitive forms , but what has been done will generally be sufficient . ? ?

On the angles made by edges .

If we have two lines referred to any co-ordinates , of which the equations are y= Ax , z=Bx ; y= A'x , z= B'x ; and if the plane angles of the faces be known ; viz. the angle which x makes with y= p , the angle which x makes with z= - , and the angle which y makes with z= w ; we shall find 6 , the angle which the two lines make with one another , by the formula , i &gt; ).i + AA'+ BB'+ ( A + A ' ) cos. ?

) When we know the symbols of the planes , the co-efficients A , B will be found by eliminating y and z in the equations of the planes where intersection is considered .
Ex. In a rhomboid it is required to find the angles made by the opposite edges of a pyramid formed of planes ( p , q , r ) .
By referring to fig. 22 .
it will be seen that opposite edges are those which are produced by intersections of planes ( p ; q ; r ) ( q ; p ; r ) and ( q ; r ; p ) ( r ; q ; p ) .
To find the equation to the first line we have px +qy +rz o qx +pyP +rz=o whence y x , z= pq x. In the same manner we should find for the second line y-X , 22.q+ r y=-x , x'=-X-- ?

) And if we take any other opposite pairs of planes , ( p r ; q ) ( q ; r ; p ) and ( q ; p ; r)(r ; p ; q ) ; or ( r ; q ; p)(r ; p ; q ) and ( p ; r ; q ) ( p ; q ; r ) ; we shall have the same value for 6 .
Hence this angle may be used as the characteristic of a pyramid produced by any such law from a rhomboid : and consequently of a dodecahedron resulting from repeating the faces of the pyramid .
It is employed in this manner by BOUJRNON in characterising the dodecahedrons of carbonate of lime , ? ?

Recapitulation .
46 .
It may be useful to collect in one view the results of the foregoing investigations .
If we take a solid angle of the primary form of a crystal for the origin , and the three edges for three co-ordinates , any secondary plane may be obtained by removing a pyramid , the edges of which consist of h , k , , molecules respectively .
If we make p q= kr = Ts the secondary plane may be represented by ( p ; q ; r ) which will express its position without determining its distance romn the origin : p , qr may be positive , o , or negative , By the law of symmetry with respect to the angles and edges of primary forms , if one secondary plane exist , certain others lust also exist , which are henc called co-existent planes .
Some , e of these are obtained by permuting the order of the e-tters in the synmbol ( p , q , r ) ; and the instances where this permutation is allowed may be distinguished from those where it is not , by separating the letters p , q , r in the former case by a comma , and in the latter by a semicolon .
The other co-existent planes in each primary form will be seen in the following table .

And it will be convenient to represent by a figure in brackets thus ( 6 ) , the number of faces which arise from each symbol .
Also frequently the crystal has parallel planes ; in which case one of them may be considered as a repetition of the other ; and the plane thus doubled may be indicated by writing a2 before it .
Thus the form of borate of magnesia , called by HAUY magnesie borated defective , may be thus represented .

Hence the opposite angles are not symmetrically affected .
The situation of planes with respect to each other , may be determined by assuming a certain point as the pole of the crystal , and measuring the latitude and longitude of the centre of the plane with respect to this pole .
If we suppose an ellipsoid of which the three axes are as the three edges a , b , c of the primitive form , we may suppose secondary planes to be in their natural position when they are drawn so as to touch the ellipsoid ; and we may consider as the centre of the face , the point of contact .
The latitude and longitude ( It and x , ) of this point , are given by the formule which follow .
In the rhomboid , the axis of the rhomboid being the axis of the crystal *2p q_ r. .
cos. x varies with V ( p+ 2+ rtp qpr qr ) sin. " .
p+.rr V ( P+ qz+ r+ ) In the prism , the axis being the axis of the prism tan .
x varies with p sin. _-_ rt And hence the ' situation of the planes is known .
Also if any of the planes , instead of touching the ellipsoid , be nearer to or farther from the centre of the crystal , the order of the planes will not be altered .
Having thus determined what planes are adjacent , we find the angles which they make , by the formulae given Art .

In the other cases we have a formula involving the three dihedral angles of the primary form .
We can also find the angles contained between any two edges by first finding the equations to the edges , and then employing a formula given , p. 125 .
The inverse problem , knowing two dihedral angles of the secondary figure to determine the symbols of the planes , is resolved by the same formulae .
In the case where the angles made with the primary planes are given , we have a direct solution .
In te oth er cases we find the indices of the symbol of trial ; and if the limits of the present paper allowed it , it might be shown how we might , after some trials , proceed directly to find the law .
P. S. The greater part of the formule in the preceding pages were calculated before my notice was directed to a paper by Mr. LEVY , in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal for April 1822 .
Mr. LEVY there employs the principle which is the basis of the investigations now given , viz. the mode of expressing a secondary plane by means of its equation to three axes coinciding with the edges of the primitive form .
From this principle he deduces , with great simplicity , the law of a secondary plane in a particular case ; viz. when the intersections of that plane with two known planes , are parallel to their intersections with two others.* In order however to deduce the general formula , a new and different series of theorems is necessary , as appears in the course of this paper .

A general Method of Calculating the Angles made by any Planes of Crystals , and the Laws according to which they are formed .
By the Rev. W. WHEWELL , F. R. S. Fellow of Trinity College , Cambridge .
Read November 25 , 1824 .

IT has been usual to calculate the angles of crystals and their laws of decrement from one another , by methods which were different as the figure was differently related to its nucleus ; which were consequently incapable of any general expression or investigation , and which had no connexion with the notation by which the planes of the crystals were sometimes expressed .
And the notation which has hitherto been employed , besides being merely a mode of registering the laws of decrement , without leading to any consequences , is in itself very inelegant and imperfect .
The different modes of decrement are expressed by means of different arbitrary symbols ; and these are combined in a manner which in some cases , as for instance in that of intermediary decrements , is quite devoid bDth of simplicity and of uniformity , and indeed , it may be added , of precision .
The object of the present paper is to propose a system which seems exempt from these inconveniences , and adapted to reduce the mathematical portion of crystallography to a small number of simple formulae of universal application .
According to the method here explained , each plane of a
