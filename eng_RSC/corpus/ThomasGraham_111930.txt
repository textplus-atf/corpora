" On Liquid Transpiration in relation to Chemical Composition .

( Abstract .
) In accordance with the analogy of the transpiration of gases , the passage of liquids under pressure through a capillary tube is spoken of as liquid transpiration .
The subject owes the development which it has already attained chiefly to the investigations of M. Poiseuille .
The precision of the mode of experimenting pursued by that physicist has been remarked on by every one who has engaged in the inquiry .
The same method was accordingly adopted with little variation in the present investigation .
The isolated observation made by M. Poiseuille , that alcohol diluted to different degrees is most retarded in passing through a capillary tube at that degree of dilution where the greatest condensation of the mixed liquids occurs , was understood by the author as indicating that the definite hydrate of alcohol containing six equivalents of water ( or three equivalents of water with the formula of alcohol taken as C2 H , 02 ) , was the most retarded in transpiration .
The rate of transpiration appeared here to depend upon chemical composition , and to afford an indication of it .
A new physical property may thus become available , like the boiling-point and others , for fixing the chemical constitution of substances .
The same feature was recognized in methylic alcohol , although the six-hydrate here is not remarkable for condensation of volume ; and the inquiry was then extended to the hydrated acids , and to other substances .
The results appear to establish the existence of a relation between transpirability and composition .
The time of passage of equal volumes of different liquids under the same pressure and at the same temperature , may be termed their transpiration times , and be referred to the time of water as unity .
The transpiration of nitric acid , NHO0 , with and without water , at 20 ?
C. was as follows : Water added to 100 Transpiration time Nitric acid ( NHO6 ) .
( water = 1 ) .

13563 The transpiration time rises with successive additions of water , till the proportion corresponding to three equivalents is reached , when the time is 2 1034 , and has attained its maximum .
Diluted beyond this point the nitric acid begins to pass more freely , and the transpiration time approaches again to that of water .
The hydrate named , NHO , +3HO , having sp. gr. 14 , possesses the highest boiling-point , and the character of definite composition .
It is what I have elsewhere spoken of as the " constitutional " hydrate of nitric acid .
In acetic acid , the constitutional hydrate , C4 H4 04 +2 HO , is indicated by transpiration with equal precision .
The transpiration time rises from 1*2801 , the time of the basic hydrate , C , H1 0O , to 2'7040 , the time of the hydrate first referred to ; falling again afterwards as the water is increased .
Butyric and valerianic acids present the same character , although slightly modified .
Formic acid , on the other hand , departs entirely from the acetic type in transpirability , as it does in the density of its combinations with water , and in its indisposition to form basic salts .
It is curious that liquid formic acid , although an acetic acid by derivation , should more resemble hydrochloric acid in physical characters .
The transpiration time of sulphuric acid is 21*6514 , a high number , as might be expected from the viscosity of the liquid .
But the time rose still further with the addition of water , till 17-5 parts of water were added to 100 of oil of vitriol , when the number was 23'7706 .
The proportion of water stated approaches closely to 18'36 parts , which represent 1 equivalent .
Here again a well-known constitutional hydrate is indicated , SHO4+HO .
In hydrochloric acid the only sensible retardation observed was with the hydrate represented by HC1 + 12 HO .
This is the hydrate which possesses least volatility at the low temperature of the experiment ( 20 ?
C. ) .
It was supposed that glycerine , as a triatomic alcohol , might affect combination with water in the proportion C6 H8- , 0+ 18 HO .
But no such compound was indicated by transpiration of the aqueous solutions of glycerine .
The transpiration of pure acetone is remarkably rapid , and is greatly retarded by the addition of water .
The time rises from 0'401 , that of anhydrous acetone , to 1 604 , the time of the twelve-hydrate , taking the equivalent of acetone as C6 HG 02 , or of the six-hydrate with the equivalent C , H3 0 .
The transpiration times and boiling-points of three alcohols are as follows : Transpiration time .

Transpiration and boiling-point observations may come thus to claim an equal interest .
In carrying out the inquiry , it will probably be found advantageous to transpire the liquids at a fixed temperature which is somewhat elevated .
A large number of substances are liquid at 100 ?
C. , of which the transpiration times could easily be obtained .
Slow transpiration and low volatility appear to go together , and both to be connected in a general way with a heavy molecule .
So also the annexation of constitutional water to the hydrated acids and alcohols appears to impede the transpiration of these substances .
