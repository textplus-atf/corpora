Observations and Experiments on the daily variation oJ the Horizontal and Dipping Needles under a reduced directive power .
By PETER BARLOW , Esq. F. R. S. of the Royal Military Academy .
Communicated by DAVIES GILBERT , Esq. V. P. R. S. Read June 12 , 1823 .
IT is now just a century since Mr. GRAHAM discovered the daily change in the variation of the horizontal needle , subsequent to which time numerous observations have been made on the same subject by WARGENTIN , CANTON , GILPIN , Colonel BEAUFOY and others , which have all confirmed , with certain shades of variety , the general fact as first described by the ingenious philosopher above named .
The actual daily change however is so small , even in the horizontal needle , that it can only be detected with the most careful observations and with the most delicate instruments ; and in the dipping needle that change , if any , is so extremely minute , as hitherto to have escaped observation : for it was only in the year 1820 , that the Royal Academy of Sciences of Copenhagen proposed the determination of this motion , on satisfactory experiments , as the prize subject for that year ; but the prize , I understand , has never been adjudged , no satisfactory communication having been received .
Under this difficulty of observation it occurred to me , that it would be possible to increase this deviation on both needles , so as to render it distinctly observable , by reducing the directive power of the needle by means of one or two magnets , properly disposed to mask , at least in part , the terrestrial influence ; a method which has been long practised by mineralogists and others , when the object has been to detect minute attractions .
I expected by this means that the cause , whatever it might be , that produces the daily variation , would exhibit itself in an increased degree , and thereby render the results more perspicuous , and fix with more precision than has hitherto been done , the time of change and moment of maximum effect .
Suppose , for example , that a finely suspended horizontal needle , under the natural influence of the earth , makes one vibration in ' , and that by masking the terrestrial influence by magnets properly adjusted , that time of vibration is increased to 8 " ; then it would follow that the directive power was reduced to one sixteenth of the former , and consequently , that any lateral magnetic force acting upon the needle would produce an effect sixteen times greater than before ; so that if the former were i2 ' , the new effect or deviation might be expected to amount to between three and four degrees , and therefore be such as to admit of distinct and satisfactory observation .
A course of experiments carried on for a few days , convinced me that my ideas were correct , and that we might , while the needle was kept in its natural meridian , or rather adjusted to that direction , produce a daily variation to almost any amount .
I obtained , for instance , the first day , a maximum deviation of ?
o40 ' ; the second , I increased it by bringing up my magnets to 7 ?
; the third day I reduced it to 2o , and so on .
I found , also , that a very considerable daily change would exhibit itself with the north end held to the south , to 37 the east , west , and , in short , in any position at pleasure , at least within certain limits , which will be pointed out as we proceed .
For this it is only necessary , first , to deflect the needle by repulsion into any required position , and then , by means of another magnet , to modify its directive power , in the same way as when in its natural meridian .
Or the same may be done by bringing two magnets with their contrary poles pointing inwards , and each opposite to the pole of the same name of the needle placed between them , and by a slight adjustment of the former to produce the deviation in question : or , which is perhaps still better , the opposing magnets may be brought into the actual direction of the dip , and then adjusted to produce the deflection required .
Having mentioned my ideas and first experiments to my colleague , Mr. CHRISTIE , and having expressed a wish that he would repeat them for the sake of verification , he very readily agreed to undertake a complete set , with the needle in its natural meridian , by means of a very delicate compass , and an apparatus he had employed for other experiments , and which admitted of his bringing his neutralizing magnets very exactly into the line of the dip .
In the mean time I proposed to undertake the observations on the dipping needle , and on the horizontal needle in different directions ; viz , with its north end pointing to the south , east , west , &amp;c. Having , however , met with some embarrassment in the commencement , and having employed , in consequence , a longer time in the observations than I had anticipated , Mr. CHRISTIE , after having finished his observation in the meridian , continued them at other points , and has thereby detected several curi ous and minute peculiarities , which , with his other experiments , will , I hope , accompany this Memoir .
Account of the observations made on the daily variation of the horizontal needle in various directions .
My first experiments , as I have already stated , were only matters of trial , from which I had merely ascertained that the idea I had formed was practicable , and that in certain situations the needle had certain directions of motion , but I had obtained no numerical results .
Having , however , provided myself with a needle proper for the purpose , very delicate and light , and eight inches and a half in length , I began , towards the end of March , to register the amount of the daily change at every hour , or half hour , from morning to night ; my son taking the observations during my occasional absence .
My first observation in the new series was made with the north end of the needle pointing to the west , balanced in that position with two magnets placed to the southward attracting each extremity ; the directive power was considerably reduced , and I obtained a maximum deviation of 3 ? ?
15 ' ; which happened at about eleven o'clock in the forenoon , and from which time the variation decreased to a late hour in the evening .
The needle was kept in this position for three days , with some change of directive power , but the character of the results , as to the direction of motion , the times of commencement and maximum , &amp;c. were of precisely the same nature , but the amount was more or less , according to the directive power left upon the needle .
Having , however , after a few days removed my apparatus from the room in which the experiments had hitherto been made , into a bower in my garden , and having detected a remarkable difference in the results obtained in these two situations , I determined to commence the experiments de novo in this latter spot , which was at least thirty yards distant from any building ; and afterwards to examine the cause of the difference in question .
This examination is reported in the conclusion of this article .
All the following experiments , therefore , will be understood to have been made in the open air , proper precautions having been taken to ensure stability .
The results are arranged according to the direction in which the needle pointed ; and the character of the daily deviation is distinguished as follows .
The reader must conceive himself as facing the north end of the needle ; then , when that end passes to his right hand the deviation is marked ( + ) , and when to his left hand ( - ) ; the bearing at six o'oclock in the morning being marked zero .

yi6e , ,.-C From the above results , although the experiments were not made under such favourable circumstances as I could wish , we may draw some very curious , if not important conclusions ; such , for instance , as the following .
That while the north end of the needle is directed to any point from the south to NNW , its motion during the forenoon is towards the left hand ; advancing therefore to some point between the NNW and north ; and while it is directed towards any point between the north and SSE it passes to the right hand , that is still to some point between the north and NNW ; the south end of the needle at the same time passing of course to some point between the south and SSE ; so that it would seem that there ought to be some direction between those limits , viz. between the N and NNW , and the S and SSE , in which the daily motion is zero , or at least a minimum , ( see Plate XXIII .
) : but whether this is a fixed direction during the year , or whether it has any vibratory motion as the sun changes its declination , or even during his daily course , is a question which cannot be , decided without a much longer course of experiments than those I have here the honour to present .
It is also questionable , whether the direction of this line of no daily variation is the same in different parts of the world ; a point on which I hope to obtain some information in the course of the present year .
Mr. FoSTER , of H. M. S. Griper , *I am already highly indebted to this Gentleman for the accurate and satisfactory observations he made during the recent voyage of H. M. S. Conway , under the command of Captain BASIL HALL , on the method I had the honour to propose for correcting the local attraction of vessels ; and it is with great pleasure that I find he has been directed by the Admiralty to continue his attention to them in the present voyage of the Griper .
My best thanks are also due to Captain HALL , for the facilities he afforded in the instance above mentioned , and for the judgment having very obligingly undertaken to repeat my experiments at Spitzbergen , during the stay of the vessel at that place for the pendulum experiments ; and from which we may hope to derive some interesting deductions , particularly in reference to the influence of the direction of the solar rays ; for it is clear from the experiments reported in the preceding table , that the amount of the deviation does not entirely depend upon the moment when the heat of the sun is the greatest , as has been generally imagined ; for the time of the maximum deviation varies from eleven o'clock in the morning to four o'clock in the afternoon , according to the direction in which the needle is pointed , and to other circumstances that will be mentioned in the conclusion of this article .
Mr. CHRISTIE'S observations are also of a kind to throw great light on this subject .
Another conclusion , which I think we are justified in drawing from the above experiments , is , that the daily change is not produced by a general deflection of the directive power of the earth , but by an increase and decrease of attraction of some point situated between the north and NNW , or between the south and SSE ( see the figure above referred to ) ; for I calnot conceive any other hypotheses that will account for two needles , situated as there shown , both approaching and both receding at the same time to and from the line of no daily variation ; nor for the total suspension or equivocal vibratory motion of a needle when placed towards this direction .
I am sorry , that not foreseeing at the commencement of with which he selected the most appropriate situations for submitting that method to the test of actual experiment .
my experiments , the length to which I should carry them , I did not , from the first , register the temperature and state of the atmosphere ; for from certain notes of this kind made lately , it appears to me that the quantity of daily change depends in a greater degree on the intensity of the solar light , than on the mere temperature of the day ; although it is certain , from some recent experiments by Mr. CHRISTIE , that the change of temperature of the air , during the day , has a much greater effect upon the intensity of action in the opposing magnets , than I could possibly have imagined .
On the daily variation of the dipping needle .
Notwithstanding my observations on the daily change of this instrument have not been so successful as those on the horizontal needle , yet it will be proper to say a few words on the subject of the experiments , although I do not intend , in the present instance , to give any numerical results ; those I have obtained not being so uniform as I could wish , nor such as to justify their publication .
The instrument I employed was made by Messrs. W. and T. GILBERT : it was remarkably free and accurate , and certainly gave results with greater uniformity than any dipping needle I ever used .
The needle was only six inches in length , a quarter of an inch broad , and very thin ; it performed in the meridian forty-one vibrations in one hundred seconds , when under the usual terrestrial influence ; and when masked and adjusted by two magnets placed in the line of the dip , it made only fifteen vibrations and a half in the same time ; the power was therefore reduced about eight times .
It is not necessary to explain here the means that I employed , and the precautions I took to ensure stability ; it will be sufficient to observe , that I paid the utmost attention to this essential condition , and that I believe my want of success did not arise from any defect in this part of the process , but from the extreme delicacy of this instrument , and the consequent difficulty in adjusting it when under the influence of the neutralizing magnets .
I tried its action for three weeks in the house , but the jarring of doors and other circumstances prevented me from drawing any conclusions ; I then removed it to the garden , to a spot well protected by trees and shrubs , and fixed the entire apparatus to my garden wall , which is exactly in the magnetic meridian ; and farther sheltered the whole in the best way I could from the effects of the wind and weather .
Indeed the only inconvenience was that I could not leave the needle out in the night , and could therefore only notice what took place in the day time , and this , as I have said above , was not so uniform as I could have desired .
In general a motion commenced soon after the instrument was adjusted in the morning ; but it was not of that gradual and progressive kind which indicated an uniformly increasing or decreasing power , as in the other instrument ; it passed , for instance , suddenly from one half or quarter degree , to another more or less , and which sometimes in the course of the day would give a difference in the dip to the amount of a degree and a half , or even more , but I seldom saw in it a tendency to return ; although when I vibrated it towards night , it commonly took up its morning position .
I made these observations with the needle in various directions , viz. with the face of the instrument to the east , west , north , south , &amp;c. but in every case I obtained the same sort of daily motion .
The question , therefore , respecting the law of variation of this instrument , still remains to be submitted to fixed principles , although there can be no longer any doubt that it is subject to a daily change .
On a curious anomaly observed between the daily variations indoors and in the open air .
I have already mentioned that I was , at the commencement of my experiments , a good deal embarrassed and delayed by certain anomalies which I noticed between the daily changes of the needle made in the house and in the garden .
These may be stated shortly as follows .
That in certain positions of the needle towards the east and west , the daily motion , although it proceeded with the same determinate uniformity in both cases , yet it took place in different directions ; passing in the one instance from the east , or west , towards the south , and in the other towards the north , at the same corresponding hours of the day , the motion in both instances being equally distinct , regular , and progressive .
After carefully examining every circumstance that might be supposed to be the cause of this singular change , I could only imagine three , that seemed in any way likely to account for it .
Ist .
Were the two magnets and the compass needle in the two cases in precisely the same relative situation ?
and if not might not the cause lie in this discrepancy ? ?
2nd .
The window of the room was to the northward ; was it possible that the light , arriving at the needle in this direction , was the cause of the change ?
sd .
There was an iron stove in the room , could it be that this was subject to a periodic increase and decrease of magnetic power ?
In order to examine the first of these cases , I measured very carefully the distance , direction , &amp;c. of the compass and magnets while in the garden , and placed them in precisely the same relative situation in the parlour ; still the motion in the two cases was reversed .
To examine the second , it occurred to me that if the direction of the motion depended upon that of the light , the needle ought to be wholly stationary in the dark , or when excluded from the solar rays .
I therefore kept my room shut for two days , and only examined the needle by the light of a wax taper ; but although there was certainly less motion on those days than usual , yet I could come to no satisfactory conclusion ; but I still think that farther observations will show that the solar light , * and not the solar heat , is the principal operative agent in producing the daily variation .
It remained , however , to examine the third query , which I attempted to do as follows .
Having placed the compass in its former situation in the garden , I fixed on one side of it a ten inch howitzer shell , in the same direction with respect to the compass as the stove had in the parlour , and at such a distance that it might produce a sensible deviation in the needle , and which I afterwards adjusted to zero by a slight change in the position of the magnets , thus placing the needle , as I imagined , under similar circumstances in both cases , with respect to local attraction ; but , notwithstanding I did in this way actually produce an alteration in the daily mo* I am sorry I have not the necessary apparatus for repeating MORICHIaN 's experiment on the violet ray ; but I would suggest to those who have , that the finest test to which this experiment could be submitted , would be to make use of a needle neutralized as above described , by which the magnetic property of the ray , if it possessed any , could not fail of showing itself .
340 tion , changing its maximum from eleven o'clock in the morning to about four o'clock in the afternoon , yet the direction of the motion was the reverse of what it was constantly found to be in-doors ; the cause therefore of this perplexing anomaly still remains to be discovered .
It is proper to observe that Mr. CHRISTIE , having made some of his observations in-doors , and some in his garden , on two compasses at the same time , found the same reversion of motion in the two cases .
His house is a mile distant from mine ; he has no stove in the room in which the in-door experiments were made ; and the only resemblance of situation is , that his window , like mine , is towards the north .
It should be farther added , that this confirmation of the singular anomaly in question did not arise from his simply repeating my experiment , but grew naturally out of the particular mode he had adopted to prosecute the enquiry ; our experiments , with the exception of the first suggestion , are independent , and therefore , where they both lead to the same result , they may be considered as confirming the accuracy of each ; and where there is any difference , they will at least point out those circumstances which require farther investigation .
P. S. The experiments to which I have alluded in page 337 , made since this article was written , seem to indicate that this anomaly , as well as the circumstance there mentioned , may be occasioned by the daily varying intensity of the opposing magnets .
