On the Laws which regulate the Absorption of polarised light by Doubly Refracting Crystal.r By David Brewster , LL. D. F. R. S. Lond. an -l Edi l. In a Letter addressed to the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks , Bart. G. C. B. Read November 12 , x188 .
MY DEAR SIR , IN examining the polarising structure of acetate of copper , my attention was drawn to certain changes of colour which this crystal exhibited when exposed in different positions to polarised light .
As this variation of colour was independent of the thickness of the plate , and of any analysis of the transmitted pencil , I had no hesitation in regarding it as a new affection of light , and in ascribing the phenomenon to the absorption of the homogeneous tints which formed the compound colour of the crystal .
I therefore collected all the natural and artificial crystals which were characterized by any peculiarity of colour , and examined the various phenomena which they presented , when cut at different angles with the axis , and when exposed in different positions to a polarised ray .
The results which I obtained during this investigation were singular and unexpected , and I am persuaded will throw considerable light on that property of transparent bodies , by which they detain and assimilate to their own substance a portion of the rays which penetrate them , while the rest are freely and copiously transmitted .
As this faculty of absorbing light is related to the axes of double refraction , I shall first describe the phenomena which are presented by crystals with One axis , and then explain the modifications which these phenomena undergo when the number of axes is increased .
SECT , I. On the absorption of polarised light by Crystals with One axis of double refraction .
If we fasten upon one side of a rhomboid of colourless calca .
reous spar , a circular aperture of such a magnitude that the two images of it appear distinctly separated when viewed through the spar , we shall find , by exposing it perpendicularly to common light , that the two images are perfectly colourless , and of the same intensity in every position of the rhomboid .
Hence if Q be the quantity of transmitted light , we shall have the ordinary image 0= Q , and the extraordinary image E= ' QWhen the rhomboid is exposed to polarised light , the intensities of the images vary with the azimuthal angle ( a ) which the axis of the rhomboid forms with the plane of primitive polarisation , and may be represented by the formulae O=Q cos.2 a ; E=Qsin.2 a. But sinceQcos .
a +Qsin .
a=Q we have O+E Q ; that is , the sum of the intensities of the two pencils is in every position equal to the whole transmitted light , and therefore the rays which leave any one of the images by a change of azimuth , are neither reflected nor absorbed , but pass over into the other image .
The ordinary phenomena of double refraction , consequently , afford us no reason for conjecturing that the crystals which possess this property absorb the incident light in any other way than is done by all other bodies , whether solid or fluid .
If we now take a rhomboid of certain specimens of yellow calcareous spar , and perform with it the experiments which have just been described , we shall obtain a series of entirely different results .
The two images will now be found to differ both in colour and intensity , the extraordinary image having an orange yellow hue , while the colour of the ordinary image is a yellowish white .
This difference of colour is distinctly related to the axis of the crystal , and increases with the inclination of the refracted ray to the short diagonal of the rhomb .
It is a maximum in the equator , while along the axis the two images have exactly the same colour and intensity .
In every position , however , the combined tints of the two images are exactly the same as the natural tint of the mineral .
In comparing the intensities of the two images , the extraordinary one appears always the faintest , so that there is an interchange of rays ; and while the extraordinary force carries off several of the yellow rays from the ordinary image 0 , the ordinary force at the same time takes to itself several of the white rays from the extraordinary image E ; for if this were not the case , the extraordinary image would always have the greatest intensity , whereas , in consequence of its exchanging yellow for white light , it becomes actually fainter than the ordinary image .
If we call nz and n the maximum number of rays which the extraordinary and the ordinary image interchange , and ( p ) the inclination of the refracted ray to the axis , the intensities may be represented by the following formulae when the crystal is exposed to common light .
0 == Q+ sin.2 q nt sin2 pn and E= -Q + sin2 pn sin.2 m. The values of m and n vary in different crystals : they are always of different 13 colours , and in some cases they are equal to nearly one half of the transmitted light , When the rhomboid is exposed to polarised light , a series of still more interesting phenomena is exhibited .
In the position where O vanishes , E is an orange yellow , exactly the same as it appeared by common light ; and in the position where E vanishes , 0 is a yellowish white , as before .
Now it is obvious , that in the first of these positions the image E was not strengthened by the white light of the vanished image 0 , otherwise the image E would have had the same colour as O+ E , or the natural tint of the spar ; and that in the second position , the image 0 had not received the whole of the vanished image E , otherwise it would have had the tint expressed by O+ E. It therefore necessarily follows , that a portion of the pencil O has been absorbed in the first position , and a portion of the pencil E in the second .
The quantity of light absorbed is a maximum in the two positions where a is o ?
and 90g , and is equal to the quantities m and n , which the two images interchange .
At different angles with the axis , therefore , it is measured by sin.2 p m , sin.2 qp n. When this angle is given , the absorbed light varies with the azimuthal angle a , and may be found from the following formula , viz. TO cos.2 a+E sin.2 a , which supposes that m and n are equal to E and 0 .
Hence when a=oT= O , or the whole of the pencil E is absorbed .
When a= 450 , r 0+ E , or one half of O and E is absorbed , and when a= o0 , T= E , or the whole of the pencil Ois absorbed .
When the absorbing crystal is viewed by a doubly refracting prism , the tintsof the two pencils Pe and Po will be given by the formulae Pe =0 cos.2 a -+ E sin " .
a , and Po =E cos.2 a -+ O sin. : a. The property which I have now described as belonging to Calcareous spar , I have found in other twelve crystals with One axis .
The colour of the ordinary and extraordinary images , or of the absorbed pencils m and n , is shown in the following table .

The property which these crystals possess of absorbing the different tints in different positions of the axis , with regard to the plane of primitive polarisation , does not belong to every specimen .
There are many crystals of ruby , sapphire , emerald , &amp;c. which give an ordinary and an extraordinary image of the same colour ; and whenever this is the case , they are destitute of the property of absorbing polarised light .
These two classes of phenomena are indeed invariably connected , and will ultimately be found to have the same origin .
The extreme generality of this property is indicated by the number of crystals in the preceding table , which embraces all the coloured crystals which are at present known to have only one axis of double refraction , excepting titanite , molybdate of lead , carbonate of iron and lime , arseniate of copper , certain specimens of sulphate of nickel , and super-acetate of copper and lime , in which I have not detected the property of absorbing polarised light.* The various coloured minerals which have the cube , the regular octohedron , and the rhomboidal dodecahedron for their primitive form , t are , as might have been expected , destitute of the property of absorption ; and I have not been able to discover it in differently coloured glasses , that have received the polarising structure from rapid cooling , or from mechanical compression , or dilatation .
Some of the preceding crystals , such as the Sapphire and the Idocrase exhibit different colours when common light is transmitted in directions parallel and perpendicular to their axis of double refraction .
A specimen of sapphire had a deep blue colour in one direction , and a yellowish green in the opposite direction ; and several specimens of idocrase had an orange yellow tint along their axis , and a yellowish green tint in a direction perpendicular to their axis .
The exhibition of two colours in the same mineral by common light , was first seen in lolite , and the Abbe Haiiy had the boldness to give it the name of Dichroite from this property , on the presumption that nature had limited it to this mineral .
This dichroismn , as it may be called , which , so far as I know , has never been observed in any other minerals than iolite and mica , is a very common property of crystallized bodies , as will be seen from the following section .

On the absorption of polarised light by crystals with two axes of double refraction .
The general phenomena of absorption in crystals with two axes , are nearly the same as those which have been described in the preceding section ; but the quantity of light which the ordinary and extraordinary forces interchange , is regulated by new laws depending on the situation of the incident ray with respect to the two axes of double refraction .
If Oo and AB , a line perpendicular to it , are the two axes , and P , P ' , the resultant axes , or the poles of no-polarisation of Blue Topaz : then if COD , the A plane of the resultant axes is perpendicular to the plane of primitive polarisation , the polarised light inI\ cident on the plate at 0 will be blue c after transmission .
TI'he blue tint preserves its intensity from 0 to A and B , the thickness of the plate B being supposed to continue the same ; but as the incident ray MDCCCXIX .
D by doubly refracting crystals .
17 passes from 0 to C and D , its intensity diminishes gradually , the light becoming more and more white with a slight tinge of red , till it reaches C and D , where it has the same colour as that of the topaz in common light .
As the plate of topaz is turned round the polarised ray , the blue tint changes into white , according to the law given in the preceding section , excepting in the line CD , where the tint is invariably white in every azimuth .
When the polarised light is transmitted along any of the resultant axes P , P ' , the two tints diverge from the poles in the form of a cross , as shown in the preceding figure .
The effect at 0 , or the interchange of the blue and white light between the ordinary and extraordinary rays , is related to the axis AB alone ; and in like manner the effect at A is related solely to the other axis 0 .
But though the axis Oo is more powerful in topaz than AB , yet the values of m and n for each axis do not appear to be different ; a result which might have been expected from the fact , that these tints in different crystals have no relation to the intensity of their polarising forces .
The diminution of the tints m and n , in passing from 0 to C and D , is owing to the action of the other axis 0 .
At the points C and D blue light alone will be transmitted when AB , considered as a separate axis , is perpendicular to the plane of primitive polarisation ; and at the same point white light alone will be transmitted when O considered as a separate axis of the same character is similarly placed .
Hence it follows , that the transmitted light should be bluish white , as it actually is , the interchanged portions being as it were in a state of equilibrium .
The following table contains the tints m and n in several crystals , in which the effect will be seen in every azimuth .

The light is , in these cases , analyzed in passing obliquely through the laminae , in the same manner as if it had been transmitted through a bundle of glass plates .
I shall now conclude this section with a particular account of some very interesting phenomena exhibited by several crystals in the preceding tables .
t. Super-acetate of copper .
When a prism of this metallic salt is exposed to the solar rays , so that the plane of refraction is perpendicular to the axis of the rhomboidal prism , and the ray passes through the angle of the rhomboid , which is 70o , two distinct images of the sun will be observed ; and the one which has suffered the greatest refraction will be greenish yellow , while the other will be of a deep blue colour .
This separation of the two tints is more distinct in some prisms than in others , owing to the manner in which they are cut from the rhomboidal crystal , and in certain points of incidence the two images have the same tint .
When a plate of super-acetate of copper is ground so thin as to be transparent , it has a brilliant green colour , composed of blue and greenish yellow .
If it is exposed to polarised light , so that the axis of the rhomboidal prism is in the plane of primitive polarisation , thegreenishyellow light will be entirely absorbed , and the transmitted ray will be of a deep blue colour .
By turning the plate round the polarised ray , the greenish yeIlow rays will re-appear , and will gradually regain their former intensity ; while the blue rays will in the same proportion be absorbed , till after one-fourth of a revolution the transmitted light will be wholly greenish yellow .
When the faces of the plate are perpendicular to any of the two resulI tant axes of the crystal , the blue and the greenish yellow light have the form of a cross , the branches of which diverge from the two poles of no-polarisation .
2 .
Augite .
When a plate of yellowish brown augite was exposed vertically to common light , the transmitted pencil had a moderate intensity ; when it was inclined to one side , in the plane of one of its neutral axes , the light became more and more intense as the obliquity increased , notwithstanding the increase of thickness in the direction of the ray .
By examining the light with a prism of calcareous spar , it was found to be all polarised in a plane perpendicular to the plane of inclination .
When the plate was now inclined , from this last position in the opposite direction , the intensity of the light gradually diminished till the plate became absolutely impervious to the strong rays of the sun .
The pencil which had formerly vanished when the light was analyzed by Iceland spar , now re-appeared , and gradually increased , becoming more and more green , while the other pencil , which became fainter , grew more and more red , till at a very great obliquity the one pencil became petfectly green , and the other a deep blood red .
By exposure to strong polarised light , the red and the green were alternately absorbed , according to the position of the neutral axis with respect to the plane of primitive polarisation .
S. Dichroite or Iolite .
This curious mineral has been long known to exhibit by common light a deep blue colour along the axis of the prism , and afaint yellow or grey colour in a direction perpendicular to it .
I have ascertained that these two colours are those of its ordinary and extraordinary images ; and even when seen by common light , that they are related to its axes of doable refraction .
Dichroite has two axes of extraordinary refraction , the two resultant axes being inclined 62* 50 ' to each other , or 3o ? ?
25 ' to the axis of the prism .
If we cut a plate of dichroite with four parallel faces , each of which is perpendicular to the resultant axes , and is inclined 3 i ? ?
25t to the axis of the prism , and expose it either to common or to polarised light , so as to have the plane of its resultant axes perpendicular to the plane of primitive polarisation , we shall observe the branches of blue and white light diverging in a beautiful manner from its poles P , P ' .
( See the figure in p. 7 , which is a very imperfect representation of the phenomenon .
) The white light becomes more blue from P and P ' to 0 , and more yellow from P and P ' to C and D. When the plane of the resultant axes is in the plane of primitive polarisation , the poles P , P ' are marked by spots of white light , but every where else the tint is a deep blue .
In the plane CADB , the mineral when seen by common light is yellow mixed with a small quantity of blue , polarised in an opposite plane .
From A and B towards P and PF , the yellow image becomes fainter till it changes into blue , and the weak blue image is reinforced by other blue rays till the intensity of the two blue images is nearly equal .
The faint blue image increases in intensity as the incident ray approaches from C and D to P and P ' .
From P and P ' to 0 one of the images is whitish , and the other deep blue , but the whiteness gradually diminishes towards 0 , where they are both equally blue.* 4 .
Epidote .
The cross formed at the resultant axes of epidote has its diverging branches brown and sap green , and they are distinctly seen in common as well as in polarised light .
The green shades into a pale greenish white as the ray recedes from P and P ' to C and D , where it is no longer divisible into two differently coloured pencils .
At 0 the two pencils are brown and green , and at A and B they are brown and a paler green .
The dichroism of the epidote is distinctly marked in common light .
Along the axis of the prism , and through two of its parallel faces , its colour is a deep orange , while through the other two parallel faces it is a yollowish green .
5 .
Mica .
A specimen of this mineral exhibits the branches diverging from P and P ' exactly in the same manner , whether it is seen by common light , or exposed to a polarised ray with the plane of the resultant axes perpendicular to the plane of primitive polarisatiori .
In these positions the branches PA , PB , &amp;c. are a dark brown , and PC , PO , &amp;c. a brownish white .
When the plane of the resultant axes is in the plane of primitive polarisation , the colours of the branches are interchanged .
The dichroism of mica is finely exhibited in some of its small and perfect crystals .
In some of these its colour by common light is greenish yellow along the axis of the prism , and of a deep garnet colour when the light is transmitted through its faces .
6 .
Anhydrite .
This mineral exhibits its dichroism by common light .
When the light is transmitted in a direction parallel to the laminae , its colour is pink ; but when it is incident in a direction perpendicular to the lamin0e , its colour is a palish yellow slightly tinged with pink , SECT .

On the influence of heat in modifying the absorbent power of crystals .
Having selected several crystals of Brazilian topaz , which displayed no change of colour by exposure to polarised light , I found , that after bringing them to a red heat , or even boiling them in olive oil or in mercury , they experienced such a change in their structure , as to exhibit distinctly the power of absorbing polarised light .
I next took a topaz , which had one of its two pencils yellow , and the other pink .
By exposing it to a red heat , the heat acted more powerfully upon the extraordinary than upon the ordinary pencil , discharging the yellow colour entirely from the one , and producing but a slight change upon the pink colour of the other .
In the formation of pink topazes by heat , it has always been supposed , that the yellow colour is actually changed into pink ; but this is quite a mistake , for the pink colour must previously exist in a state of combination with the yellow , and must either form the colour or exist in the colour of one of the pencils produced by double refraction .
The heat does no more than discharge one colour , and leave the other almost unimpaired .
This result is of considerable practical importance to the jeweller , asit enables him to determine before hand , whether or not any topaz will receive a pink colour from heat ; for if this colour exists in one of its images , which will in general be seen by exposing it to a polarised ray , he may predict with certainty the success of his experiment .
When a topaz possessing a pink tint has been taken from the fire , it is at first perfectly colourless , and acquires the pink colour gradually in the act of cooling .
By exposing it repeatedly to the action of a very intense heat , I have never been able either to remove or to modify this permanent tint .
With the view of ascertaining if the absorbing structure could be induced by heat , I exposed to a white heat several crystals of yellowish calcareous spar .
After the action of the fire had been continued for some time , a sort of opalescence , or milky opacity , was induced ; and the light , which went to the formation of the ordinary image , was much redder than that which formed the extraordinary ray .
This effect I naturally ascribed to some change in the state of the carbonic acid ; and upon continuing the action of the heat , and watching the process of decomposition , I found that when the carbonic acid was expelled from a film about the 200ooth part of an inch thick , its surface was covered with vesicles arranged in straight lines parallel to thf short diagonal of the rhomboid .
These vesicles had , in general , an ellip .
tical form , with a cut or opening in the direction of their transverse axis through which the gas had escaped .
After the spar was taken from the fire , a great number of the vesicles burst with a noise similar to that which accompanies the bursting of the indusium of the fern , and carried off a portion of the thin calcareous pellicle .
When this pellicle was removed , the subjacent surface was covered with a series of minute parallel grooves inclined about 20o 57 ' to the short diagonal .
In repeating this experiment , and seizing the proper time for withdrawing the spar from the fire , I have never failed to observe the fact of the arrangement and bursting of the vesicles , and I have no hesitation in concluding , that the carbonic acid is arranged in planes passing through the axis of the crystal , a result which I had formerly assumed in explaining the phenomena of double refraction .
This method of studying the structure of bodies by watching them in the process of disintegration , may be found to have a very extensive application in chemical and mine- .
ralogical enquiries .
The observations contained in the preceding pages , indicate in a manner by no means equivocal , that the colouring particles of crystals , instead of being indiscriminately dispersed throughout their mass , have an arrangement related to the ordinary and extraordinary forces which they exert upon light .
In some specimens the extraordinary medium is tinged with the same colouring particles , and with the same number of them as the ordinary medium : but in other specimens of the same mineral , the extraordinary medium is either tinged with a different number of particles of the same colour , or with a colouring matter entirely different from that of the ordinary medium .
In certain specimens of topaz , the-colouring matter of the one medium is more easily discharged than that of the other ; and in two specimens of emerald , the colouring matter which tinges the ordinary medium in the one , tinges the extraordinary medium in the other , and vice versa .
All those crystals in which the colouring matter of the one medium differs either in character or intensity , possess the property of absorbing the two tints according to the laws already mentioned , but there is also reason to believe , that polarised light suffers the same kind of absorption in those crystals whose two images have the same tint , and even in those which are perfectly colourless .
I have the honour to be , &amp;c. DAVID -BREWSTER Mdinburgb , Oct. 17tb , 1818 .
