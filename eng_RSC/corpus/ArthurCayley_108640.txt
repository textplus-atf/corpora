Memoir on the Conditions for the Existence of given Systems of Equalities among the Roots of an Equation .
By ARTHUR CAYLEY Eq , E F.R.S. Received December 18 , 1856 , -Read January 8 , 1857 .
IT is well known that there is a symmetric function of the roots of an equation , viz. , the product of the squares of the differences of the roots , which vanishes when any two roots are put equal to each other , and that consequently such function expressed in terms of the coefficients and equated to zero , gives the condition for the existence of a pair of equal roots .
And it was remarked long ago by Professor SYLVESTER , in some of his earlier papers in the 'Philosophical Magazine , ' that the like method could be applied to finding the conditions for the existence of other systems of equalities among the roots , viz. that it was possible to form symmetric functions , each of them a sum of terms containing the product of a certain number of the differences of the roots , and such that the entire function might vanish for the particular system of equalities in question ; and that such functions expressed in terms of the coefficients and equated to zero would give the required conditions .
The object of the present memoir is to extend this theory and render it exhaustive , by showing how to form a series of types of all the different functions which vanish for one or more systems of equalities among the roots ; and in particular to obtain by the method distinctive conditions for all the different systems of equalities between the roots of a quartic or a quintic equation , viz. for each system conditions which are satisfied for the particular system , and are not satisfied for any other systems , except , of course , the more special systems included in the particular system .
The question of finding the conditions for any particular system of equalities is essentially an indeterminate one , for given any set of functions which vanish , a function syzygetically connected with these will also vanish ; the discussion of the nature of the syzygetic relations between the different functions which vanish for any particular system of equalities , and of the order of the system composed of the several conditions for the particular system of equalities , does not enter into the plan of the present memoir .
I have referred here to the indeterminateness of the question for the sake of the remark that I have availed myself thereof , to express by means of invariants or covariants the different systems of conditions obtained in the sequel of the memoir ; the expressions of the different invariants and covariants referred to are given in my ' Second Memoir upon Quantics , ' Philosophical Transactions , vol. cxlvi .

Suppose , to fix the ideas , that the equation is one of the fifth order , and call the roots , , 7 , y8 , s. Write 12= ( .---3 ) , 12.13= ( a--)/ ( o-y)m , 12.34= -2(-)l(y-- ) , &amp;c. , where p is an arbitrary function and I , m , &amp;c. are positive integers .
It is hardly necessary to remark that similar types , such as 12 , 13 , 45 , &amp;c. , or as 12.13 and 23.25 , &amp;c. , denote identicallythesame sums .
Two types , suchas 12.13 and 14.15.23.24.25.34.35.45 , may be said to be complementary to each other .
A particular product ( a-(3)(y--~ ) does or does not enter as a term ( or factor of a term ) in one of the above-mentioned sums , according as the type 12.34 of the product , or some similar type , does or does not form part of the type of the sum ; for instance , the product ( a3)(y ) is a term ( or factor of a term ) of each of the sums 12 .
34 , 13.45.24 , &amp;c. , but not of the sums 12.13.14.15 , &amp;c. 2 .
If , now , we establish any equalities between the roots , e. g. o=-3 , y=S , the effect will be to reduce certain of the sums to zero , and it is easy to find in what cases this happens .
The sum will vanish if each term contains one or both of the factors Ma-3 , y-- , i. e. if there is no term the complementary of which contains the product ( a-)(y-- ) , or what is the same thing , whenever the complementary type does not contain as part of it , a type such as 12.34 .
Thus for the sum 14.15.24.25.34.35.45 , the complementary type is 12.13.23 , which does not contain any type such as 12.34 , i. e. the sum 14.15.24.25.34.35.45 vanishes for M=-3 , y=- .
It is of course clear that it also vanishes for M a=--=s , y= or o=-3 =y=-= , &amp;c. , which are included in -a=-3 , y= .
But the like reasoning shows , and it is important to notice , that the sum in question does not vanish for c=13==y : and of course it does not vanish for a=--3 .
Hence the vanishing of the sum 14.15.24.25.34.35.45 is characteristic of the system o=c_-3 , y=- .
A system of roots os , 3 , ry , s may be denoted by 11111 ; but if a=-3 , then the system may be denoted by 2111 , or if -=P(3 , y=- , by 221 , and so on .
We may then say that the sum 14.15.24.25.34.35.45 does not vanish for 2111 , vanishes for 221 , does not vanish for 311 , vanishes for 32 , 41 , 5 .

For thepurpose of obtaining the entire system of results it is only necessary to form Tables , such as the annexed Tables , the meaning of which is sufficiently explained by what precedes : the mark ( x ) set against a type denotes that the sum represented by the complementary type vanishes , the mark ( o ) that the complementary type does not vanish , for the system of roots denoted by the symbol at the top or bottom of the column ; the complementary type is given in the same horizontal line with the original type .
It will be noticed that the right-hand columns do not extend to the foot of the Table ; the reason of this of course is , to avoid a repetition of the same type .
Some of the types at the foot of the Tables are complementary to themselves , but I have , notwithstanding this , given the complementary type in the form under which it naturally presents itself .

In order that a quartic may have a pair of equal roots , or what is the same thing , that the system of roots may be of the form 211 , the type to be considered is 12.13.14.23.24.34 ; this of course gives as the function to be equated to zero , the discriminant of the quartic .
6 .
In order that there may be two pairs of equal roots , or that the system may be of the form 22 , the simplest type to be considered is 14.24.34 ; -this gives the function ( ^)(P-)(yp)( y)2(X-y)2(X-_y)2 which being a covariant of the degree 3 in the coefficients and the degree 6 in the variables , can only be the cubicovariant of the quartic .
7 .
In order that the quartic may have three equal roots , or that the system of roots may be of the form 31 , we may consider the type 13.14.23.24 , and we obtain thence the two functions ( -7 ) ( -)(-7)(P- ) ( a r7)2(Q _ $)( _r)(P _)2 , which being respectively invariants of the degrees 2 and 3 , are of course the quadrinvariant and the cubinvariant of the quartic .
If we had considered the apparently more simple type 12.34 , this gives the function which is the quadrinvariant , but the cubinvariant is not included under the type in question .
8 .
Finally , if the roots are all equal , or the system of roots is of the form 4 , then the simplest type is 12 ; and this gives the function ( V _P)2(X-_y)2(X-y)2 , a covariant of the degree 2 in the coefficients and the degree 4 in the variables ; this is of course the Hessian of the quartic .
Considering next the case of the quintic:9 .
In order that a quintic may have a pair of equal roots , or what is the same thing , that the system of roots may be of the form 2111 , the type to be considered is 12.13.14.15.23.24.25.34.35.45 ; this of course gives as the function to be equated to zero , the discriminant of the quintic .
10 .
In order that the quintic may have two pairs of equal roots , or that the system of roots may be 221 , the simplest type to be considered is 14.15.24.25.34.35.45 ; a type which gives the function ( ~ --)(0-)( ( -)(y)(y-)()2(xMy)3(X pie )3( y)3 .
This is a covariant of the degree 5 in the coefficients and of the degree 9 in the variables ; but it appears from the memoir above referred to , that there is not any irreducible covariant of the form in question ; such covariant must be a sum of the products ( No. 13)(No .
20 ) , ( No. 13)(No .
14)2 , ( No. 15)(No .
16 ) ( the numbers refer to the Covariant Tables given in the memoir ) , each multiplied by a merely numerical coefficient .
These numerical coefficients may be determined by the consideration that there being two pairs of equal roots , we may by a linear transformation make these roots 0 , 0 , oo , oo , or what is the same thing , we may write a=b=e=f=O , the covariant must then vanish identically .
The coefficients are thus found to be 1 , -4 , 50 , and we have for a covariant vanishing in the case of two pairs of equal roots , 1 ( No. 13)(No .
20 ) 4 ( No. 13)(No .
14)2 +50 ( No. 15)(No .
16 ) .
In fact , writing a=b=e=f 0O , and rejecting , where it occurs , a factor x2y2 , the several covariants become functions of cx , die ; and putting , for shortness , x , y instead of cx , die , the equation to be verified is 1.10(x+y)(6x +8x3y+28xy2+8x3+6y4 ) 4.10(+y)(3x2+2xy+ 3y2)2 + 50(6x2+ 8xy+ 6y2)(x + 2y + y2+y3 ) = 0 .
And dividing out by ( x+y ) and reducing , the equation is at once seen to be identically true .
11 .
In order that the quintic may have three equal roots , or that the system of roots may be of the form 311 , the simplest type to be considered is 12.13.23.45 ; this gives the function ~( ?
~)"(PrY)2(r~)2()4 , which being an invariant , and being of the fourth degree in the coefficients , must be the quartinvariant of the quintic .
The same type gives also the function ( S ~)2(P _)2(r ) 2(X_-0 )-y)2(x _ %)- , which is a covariant of the degree 4 in the coefficients and the degree 4 in the variables ; and it must vanish when a=-b=-=0c , this can only be the covariant 3(No .
20)-2(No .
14)2 , which it is clear vanishes as required .
12 .
In order that the quintic may have three equal roots and two equal roots , or that the system of roots may be of the form 32 , the simplest type to be considered is 12.13.14.15 , which gives the function ( c_)(Y)( ?
r )( , EX)(x &amp; 0)(3(XYY)3 ( x y)(xSy)3 , a covariant of the degree 4 in the coefficients , and the degree 12 in the variables ; and it must vanish when a=b=c=0 , e=fO0 ; this can only be the covariant 3(No .
13)2(No .
14)-25(No .
15)2 , which it is clear vanishes as required .
13 .
In order that the quintic may have four equal roots , or that the system may be of the form 41 , the simplest type to be considered is 12.34 , which gives the function ( EA(MrV(x 2SY)2 % a covariant of the degree 2 in the coefficients , and of the same degree in the variables ; this can only be the covariant ( No. 14 ) .
14 .
Finally , in order that all the roots may be equal , or that the system of roots may be of the form 5 , the type to be considered is 12 ; and this gives the function ( P )2((xry)2(xWy)2(xy)2 , a covariant of the degree 2 in the coefficients , and the degree 6 in the variables , and this can only be the Hessian ( No. 15 ) .
It will be observed that all the preceding conditions are distinctive ; for instance , the covariant which vanishes when the system of roots is of the form 311 , does not vanish when the system is of the form 221 , or of any other form not included in the form 311 .
