( Abstract .
) This paper relates to the second theorem , viz. that which asserts that every number is composed of 4 square numbers ( O [ or zero ] being considered as an even square ) .
If every odd number be composed of 4 square numbers , them every even number must also be composed of 4 square numbers ; for every even number must , on a continuied division by 2 , ultimately become an odd number .
The paper relates chiefly to the Table which accompanies it , from which it appears that a remarkable law obtains as to the division of odd numbers ( 2n +1 ) into 4 square numbers-whenl a number of the form 4n+ 1 is divisible into 2 square numbers , which ( as 4nÂ§ 1 is an odd number ) must be one of them odd , the other even .
Before explaining , the Table , it is proper to state that if an odd number be divisible into 4 square numbers , three of them must be odd , and one of them even , or one of them must be odd , and 3 of them even , otherwise their sum canniot be an odd number ; it follows from this that if the difference between any two of them be an odd number , the difference between the other two must be an even nuunber , and vice versed ; for let a2+ ba+ c2+ d'= 2n + 1 , then if a2-b'=2p , c2-d ' must equal 2q + I ; if possible let c'-d2= 2r , then a22+ c2d 2= 2p+2r ; add 2b2 + 2d2 ( an even number ) to each , and a2 +62 + c2 + d2 will be an even number , which by the hypothesis it is not ; if , therefore , a2 _b2 be an even number , c'd2 cannot also be an even number , and therefore must be an odd one .
If , therefore , the four roots of the squlares into which any odd number may be divided are arranged in any order there will be three differences ; the two exterior differences will be one odd , the other even ; the middle difference may be either odd or even .
The Table is arranged thus : the lowest row of figures is the series 1 , 5 , 9 , 13 , 17 , &amp;c. ( 4n+ 1 ) ; the next row above is the series of natural numbers , 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , &amp;c. ( n ) , &amp;c. ; the next row is 1 , 3 , a , 7 , 9 , &amp;c. ( 2n+ 1 ) the odd numbers ; each of the odd numbers is the first term in a series increasing uipwards by the iium57 .

bers 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , &amp;c. , forming an arithmetic series of the second order ( the first and second differences being respectively 2 each ) ; when the number in the lowest row cannot be divided into 2 squares , the arithmetic series is not formed , and the squares are marked with an asterisk , but when the number 4n+ 1 is divisible into 2 square numbers , the roots of these squares constitute the two exterior differences of the roots into which the odd number may be divided , and also of the roots into which each term of the series increasing upward may be divided ; the middle difference of the roots will be the smaller half of the sum of the 2 roots of the square numbers into which 4n+ 1 may be divided , with a negative sign , and will increase by 1 in each successive term of the upward series .
For example , in the Table take the number 29 in the lowest row , 7x4+ l-29 , 7 is the number above it , and 7x2+l= 15 the odd n-umber , which is the first term of the series 15 , 17 , 21 , 2W7 , 35 , &amp;c. Now 29 is composed of 2 square numbers , 4 and 25 , whose roots are 2 and 5 , 2+5=7 ; the smaller half is 3 , and 2 , -3 , 5 will be the differences of the roots of the squares into which 15 may be divided , and whose sum will equal 1 ; thus 2 , -3 , 5 -1 , 1 , -2 , 3 ; the roots when squared and added together equal 15 , and the other terms of the series follow in like manner , obeying the law indicated ; thus 5 , -2 , 2 3 , 2 , 0 , 2 when squared and added .
=17 2 , -1 , 5 -2 , 0 , -1 , 4 when squared and added .
=21 5 , 0 , 2 -4 , 1 , 1 , 3 when squared arid added .
=27 2 , 1 , 5 -3 , -1 , 0 , 5 whose squares ... .

If any number be composed of two triangular numbers , it will also equal a square and a double triangular number .
If a'+a 62+ 622 it will be of the form a2 +a+62 , and may be assumed equial to a2+ a+ 62 .
For if 2 numbers be both odd or both even , they may always be represented by a+ b and a-b ; if one be odd and the other even , they may always be represented by a +6 ?
1 and a -6 , or by a+b and a-b + 1 ; and if the two inumbers be made the bases of trigonal numbers , the stum of the two trigonal numbers will always be of the form a2+a+b2 , or a2+bb2 : now when any number in the natural series of numbers is composed of two triangular numbers , it may be represented by a2+ a+ b2 , and 4n +I will then equal 4a2+4a+ 1 +4b2 , -obviously the sun1 of an odd and an even square , whose roots are 26 and 2a + 1 ; and 2n + 1 , the corresponding odd number , will equal 2a2 + 2a+ 1+ 262 , -obviously composed of 4 square numbers , whose roots are 6 , b , a , a+ 1 ; and if they be arranged thus , 2b , -(a+b ) 2a+1 -6b , , -a , a+ 1 , so that the sum of their roots may equal 1 , the exterior differences of the roots will be 2b and 2a+ 1 , the roots of the two squares into which 4n+ 1 is divisible ; and the middle difference will be ( a + b ) , the smualler half of the sum of the roots ( 2b+ 2a + 1 ) with a negative sign ; if the exterior differences be reversed and the middle difference be inlcreased by 1 , the differences will be 2a+ 1 , -(a+ b-1 ) , 26 , and the roots whose sum will equal 1 will be , with their differences above them , 2a+l , -(a+b-1 ) , 2b -(a+Jl ) , a-(6-1 ) , 6+1 , and the sum of the squares of the roots will be 2 more ; from these two sets of roots all the rest may be obtained , by adding one to each of two roots and subtracting 1 from each of the other two roots ; the exterior differences of the roots will therefore always be the same , and the middle difference will increase by 1 at each step ; the sum1 of the squares of the roots will increase by 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , &amp;c. As the sum of any two square numbers of which one is odd and the other even ( 4a'+ 4a +1+ 4b2 ) must be of the form 4n + 1 , every possible case of an odd square combined with an even square must occur somewhere in the series 1 , 5 , 9 , 13 , &amp;c. , and the Table ( if extenided ) must conitaini every possible case of odd and eveni numbers as exterior differences , combined with every possible and available middle difference ; for negative differences may be rejected , inasmuch as , if the roots be put according to their algebraic value , all the differences must be even ; thus the roots and differences of 15 above were 2 , -3 , 5 1 , 1 , -2 , 3 ; if the roots be placed according to their algebraic value , they would be -2 , -1 , 1 , 3 , and with the differences above 1 , 2 , 2 -2 , -1 , 1 , 3 ; 15 will therefore be found in the column above 5 , and in the fourth place .
The Table ( extended inidefinitely ) would therefore contain every possible odd number the sum of whose roots may equal 1 .
It is possible that this connexion between the roots of the squares into which 4n+ 1 may be dlivided , with the exterior differences of the roots of the fouir square numbers into which 2n+ 1 may be divided , formed part of the mysterious properties of numbers to which Fermat alluded when he announced the theorems of the polygonal numbers .
