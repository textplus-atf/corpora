Received June 18 , -Read June 18 , 1863 .
IT was some time since proposed by the Kew Committee of the British Association to determine the temperature of the melting-point of mercury , in order if possible to add a third to the two familiar points which have been so long exclusively used in graduating thermometers ; and afterwards the sum of ?
150 was voted for this purpose by the Government Grant Committee of the Royal Society .
In prosecuting this research , the final arrangement of apparatus has cost much labour and time ; but the results at length obtained have exhibited a precision which has induced me to present them to the Society in the following communication .
I shall in the first place endeavour to describe the apparatus used , and shall then give an account of the experiments made and deduce results .
Description of Apparatus .
The apparatus employed was very similar in principle and construction to that used by REGNAULT in his fourth set of experiments on the dilatation of elastic fluids , the coefficient sought being that which denotes the increase for 1 ?
Fahr. of the elastic force of a gas the volume of which is constant .
This apparatus was constructed by Mr. BECKLEY , mechanical assistant at Kew , to whose skill in device and execution I am on this occasion very much indebted ; and I would likewise desire to acknowledge the promptness and skill with which the requisite glassblowing has been executed by Mr. CASELLA .
The atmospheric air upon which it is desired to operate is contained in the glass bulb B ( Plate XXIV .
fig. 2 ) , and this is connected by means of a capillary tube t with another tube T of larger bore , which is cemented into an iron fitting , D. This fitting is tightly screwed , by means of an india-rubber washer , upon a reservoir R filled with mercury , and there is thus a communication between the mercury of the reservoir and the bore of the tube T. Another tube , T ' , similar to T , is attached in the same manner to an iron fitting D ' , and by means of it to the reservoir R ; but the fitting D ' is furnished with a stopcock , by shutting which the communication between the reservoir and the bore of T ' may be interrupted at pleasure .
The upper extremity of T ' communicates with the atmospheric air .
The reservoir R , which is made of cast iron , is fitted accu , rately into a strong slate slab , which is in its turn supported by a solid block of masonry , ( figs. 1 &amp; 2 ) is a screw which drives a plunger P up and down , by means of which the capacity of the reservoir R may be enlarged or contracted at pleasure .
The consequence is that when the capacity of the reservoir is diminished the mercury will ascend in the tube T , and also in T ' if the stopcock be open , while if the capacity be increased it will descend in these tubes .
The inside of the reservoir is so shaped as to push up any small bubble of air that might otherwise have remained in during the process of filling with mercury .
There is also a fine screw , ' , with a graduated head , which drives a fine plunger P ' ; and the change of capacity of the reservoir due to one revolution of this screw requires to be accurately ascertained .
A little above h ' there are two side tubes , terminating in bulbs b , b ' , which are attached at an angle to the tube T. One of these bulbs contains a desiccating substance , such as sulphuric acid , baryta , or anhydrous phosphoric acid , while the other contains a little caustic potash , a substance which has a strong attraction for carbonic acid .
Let us begin by supposing these two bulbs to be attached to the tube T , as in fig. 1 , and let us also suppose that they are open to the atmosphere at their extremities .
Suppose in fact that the tube T with its appendages has just been screwed on to the reservoir R. Now by means of the screw S drive the mercury up T until it reaches the level h ' a little below the opening where the side tubes branch off ; and when it has reached this level , seal off the extremities of the two bulbs .
All communication between the air in the bulbs and the atmosphere is thus intercepted .
The bulb B must now be heated as often as possible , and each time a portion of its air will be driven into the bulbs b , b ' , and there deprived of moisture and carbonic acid .
The tube t should also be heated occasionally , and also the tube T above h ' , including the appendage tubes , but not the bulbs , the object being to drive away any moisture which may cling to the glass ; but at the same time care must be taken not to heat the mercury , in case by any possibility some of its vapour may enter into the bulb B. It is evident that , if this process be continued long enough , the air of the bulb B will be completely deprived of aqueous vapour and of carbonic acid ; also by heating B occasionally above 300 ?
F. , any ozone which it may at first have contained will be destroyed .
When satisfied that the air of the bulb B has been thoroughly deprived of all these substances , seal off the appendage tubes , thereby detaching the bulbs b , 6 ' ; and then by means of the screw S drive up the mercury to about the level h. If the branch tubes are properly shaped , the mercury will now have run down and filled them .
We have thus procured a quantity of unexceptionable air , which fills the bulb B and that portion of its attached tube above h. It is well to remark that the tubes T and T ' are supposed to be well cleaned , and the mercury used to be quite pure .
In making an observation , the mercury is driven first by means of the screw S , and afterwards by the more delicate motion of S ' to a fixed level h , which is chosen near the top of the tube T , and the reading of the cathetometer C for this point is noted .
It is clear that the height of the column of mercury in the long tube T ' ( the stopcock at D ' being open ) will depend upon the elastic force of the air in the bulb B as compared with that of the atmosphere .
If this elasticity be altered by increasing or diminishing the temperature of B , the height of the mercury in T ' , as read by the cathetometer , will be altered also ; and hence the difference given by the scale of the cathetometer between the fixed level h , at which the mercury in T is always set , and the surface of the column of mercury in T ' will afford an indication of the temperature of the bulb B* .
It is on this principle that the instrument is used as a thermometer .
The mercury used in these experiments was purified in the following manner .
It was first heated for some time with dilute nitric acid and then allowed to remain in contact with strong sulphuric acid , being frequently stirred in both cases .
It was afterwards well washed , first with a little caustic potash and afterwards with pure water , and was finally mixed with pounded sugar , and well filtered through paper before use .
It was thought desirable to ascertain whether different specimens of mercury so treated were of precisely the same specific gravity ; and with this purpose the following experiment was made .
The mercury used in the construction of the Kew Standard Barometer , described by JOHN WELSH in the Philosophical Transactions , 1856 , page 507 , was compared with that used in the construction of another standard barometer , since erected at Kew , and also with the mercury used in the experiments now described ; and the following was the result : Specific-gravity bottle , filled with mercury from the cistern of old Kew standard ... ... .

F. 13975-8 grs. The same , filled with mercury from the cistern of the new Kew standard ... ... ... ... weighed at 620 F. 13976-1 grs. The same , filled with mercury used in the experiments with air-thermometer.weighed at 62 ?
F. 13976-4 grs. It will be seen from this how small is the observed difference in specific gravity between these various specimens of mercury , and that even if this were not due to error of observation , yet would the difference between the readings of standard barometers constructed from these different specimens scarcely exceed one thousandth of an inch .
But while these specimens of mercury are sufficiently pure , if the fluid be used in measuring pressure , it might still be doubted whether they would all have the same melting-point .
The following experiment will decide this question .
An old Kew standard thermometer ( No. 45 ) was thrust into a beaker which contained eight or ten pounds of mercury , half frozen , half melted .
The mercury was not the same as that used in the experiments with the air-thermometer .
The reading ( observed by Dr. W. A. MILLER and myself ) was. .
-3 75 In an experiment with the mercury used in the air-thermometer in a vessel which contained fifty pounds half frozen , half meltedThe same thermometer read on one occasion ... -37*80 The same thermometer read on another occasion. .
37'70 The reading of this thermometer at the melting-point of ice throughout all these observations was..32*45 It may therefore be concluded that the melting-point of well-purified mercury for different specimens of the fluid , and for different masses , is practically a point of constant temperature , and that this temperature , as indicated by a Kew standard thermometer ( graduated throughout according to the diameter of the bore ) , is 700 ?
2 below the freezing-point of water , or is equal to -38 ' ?
2 F. The boiling-point apparatus used in these experiments was that recommended by REGNAULT .
It is represented in fig. 2 ; and I need only remark that the steam , after passing round the bulb B , flows down by the channel indicated by arrow-heads , and finally escapes into the atmosphere by an orifice near the bottom of the apparatus .
The bulb is thus entirely surrounded by steam in a state of motion .
This piece of apparatus was compared with two others of the same description but of very different dimensions ( one being the small apparatus used by travellers ) ; and the agreement of the three , as tested by a thermometer , was very exact .
Distilled water was always used during these experiments .
A box with a few small holes bored in its bottom was that used to contain the melting ice , and care was taken that the ice was really in a melting state .
The arrangement for the melting mercury is represented in figs. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 .
The vessel for holding it consists of two wooden boxes , the one within the other , with a lining of felt between .
When the box was filled with mercury , the bulb , in order to counteract the upward pressure of the fluid , was bound by a string to the bottom of the box .
An agitator ( figs. 4 , 5 , 6 ) , made of wire gauze , was made to surround the bulb when the freezing-experiment was in progress , the compartments of which were easily penetrated by fluid mercury .
The solid lumps of mercury were introduced outside of the wire gauze ; and the agitator served the double purpose of keeping these from contact with the bulb and of promoting currents , by means of which the whole mass was kept at a uniform temperature .
For the success of these experiments I am much indebted to Mr. ROBERT ADDAMS of London ; indeed without his ready cooperation it would have been impossible for me to freeze mercury in sufficient quantity .
This gentleman took the trouble to bring cylinders containing liquid carbonic acid to Kew whenever the freezing-experiment was to be performed .
I need not here describe how solid carbonic acid is procured from these cylinders , nor how by mixing this with ether a very intense cold is produced ; it is sufficient to state that by this process a very large quantity of mercury may be kept frozen for a length of time with great facility .
Experiments and Results .
The following are the formulae used in the reduction of these experiments : Let P denote the elastic force of the air in the bulb B when it is surrounded with melting ice , and let the atmosphere around , including the mercury in the two tubes T , T ' , be at the temperature 32 ?
+t .
Also let P ' denote the elastic force of the same air when the bulb is at the temperature 32 ?
+T , the atmosphere being supposed to remain at 32 ?
+t .
Further , let V denote the internal volume at 32 ?
of the bulb B , and of that portion of the capillary tube which is subjected to the heating and cooling agents , and let v denote the internal volume at 32 ?
of that portion of the tube T above the mercury which is not subject to the influence of these agents , but which contains air which may be supposed to retain the constant temperature 32 ?
+t throughout the experiment .
Also let k denote the coefficient of expansion for 1 ?
F. of the glass , and let a denote the corresponding coefficient of increase of elastic force of dry air the volume of which remains constant ; and , finally , let us denote by unit of mass the air which occupies unit of volume under unit of pressure at the temperature of 32 ?
F. Then PV denotes the mass of the enclosed air which exists at the temperature of 32 ?
F. when the bulb is surrounded by melting ice ; also Pv +t is that which exists , at the same time , at the temperature of the atmosphere ( 32 ?
+t ) .
Hence the whole mass of air operated upon will be denoted by P V+ l+ kt } P.V +v.(1 .

Hence the mass of air existing at temperature 32 ?

Now according to this observer 1+180c &amp; =1-3665 .
Hence c=-002036 nearly .
429 It must also be noted that in the boiling-water experiment T is determined in conformity with the report presented to the British Government by the Commissioners appointed to construct standard weights and measures , according to which 212 ?
F. is taken to represent at London the temperature of steam at the pressure of 29-905 inches of mercury reduced to 32 ?
F. This is also the value of 212 ?
F. , which has been adopted by the Kew Committee of the British Association* .
When it is the freezing-point of mercury which we wish to determine , the formula ( 3 .
) must be altered as follows:1+aT pit l+kTpV 1 +kt .
( 4 .
) ^"P-^rf P ) Here it is T which we wish to determine , and which will of course appear as a negative quantity .
The value of a is in this case supposed to have been previously determined .
Experiments made in order to determine a..-First Series .
In the first set of experiments made for this purpose a flint-glass bulb was used .
Its volume and coefficient of expansion were determined by cleaning it , first , with nitric acid , secondly with sulphuric acid , afterwards with water , and , lastly , drying it with alcohol , after which process it admits of being well filled with mercury without any specks .
It was then ascertained what weight of this fluid it held at 32 ?
, and also at 212 ? .
grs. The weight of mercury at 32 ?
was ascertained to be 10169-3 , That of mercury at 212 ?
was ascertained to be. .
10011 4 , showing a loss of 157-9 grs. Had the glass not dilated , the loss of weight would have been =181*4 grs. ( if we suppose the expansion of mercury between these two points to be =0-018153 , which is REGNAULT'S determination ) .
Hence the dilatation of the glass envelope of the bulb between 32 ?
and 212 ?
was -00235 , or the coefficient of expansion of the glass for 1 ?
F. =-0000131=k .
Also , assuming 252X5 grs. to be the weight of 1 cubic inch of water at 62 ?
, and having found by experiment 13-584 to be the specific gravity of the mercury used compared with water at 62 ?
, we obtain cub. in .
Capacity of the bulb at 62 ?
= 2-957 Capacity of the bulb at 32 ?
= 2-956 nearly .
The bulb having been thus calibrated was sealed on to the capillary tube t , and , along with its appendage bulbs b , b ' and tube T , was attached to the reservoir at D in the manner already described .
In this experiment the bulb b contained anhydrous phosphoric acid , and b ' fused caustic potash ; while these tubes were attached , the bulb B was heated and cooled very many times .
The potash bulb b ' was detached in about a week , but the phosphoric acid bulb was kept attached for at least three weeks .
It has been already remarked that in these experiments the mercury in the tube T is always brought to a fixed point , determined by its cathetometer-reading , this being as near the top as is conveniently possible .
Also , when the boiling-point apparatus is attached , it is arranged so as always to embrace , along with the bulb , the same portion of the capillary tube .
If this position be marked , on one side of the mark we shall have air of the temperature of steam , and on the other side air of nearly the same temperature as the atmosphere .
In order to estimate the volume of air existing in the tube at the atmospheric temperature when the mercury has been set to its fixed point by means of the cathetometer , shut the stopcock at D ' , and estimate , by means of the graduated head , the number of revolutions and parts of a revolution of the fine screw S ' requisite to bring the mercury to that point in the capillary tube t which has been marked as that where the temperature of the boiling-water apparatus commences .
It may perhaps be objected to this method of measuring V , that should there be a small bubble of air lurking in the reservoir R , or at the points of the appendage tubes , after the bulbs b , b ' have been detached , this air will contract under the additional pressure caused by raising the mercury in T , and will consequently make v appear to be greater than it really is .
It has , however , been ascertained , by means of pushing the mercury to a fixed point of the capillary tube t , with the stopcock at D ' shut , and then increasing the pressure by heating the bulb , that the error arising from this source is inappreciable .
It has also been ascertained , by means of inserting a small thermometer , that the temperature of the air in the tube immediately above the mercury at h remains nearly the same as that of the atmosphere without , even when the boiling-water apparatus is in operation .
It requires two observers to work the instrument .
When the ice or boiling-water apparatus has been sufficiently long attached to make the observations constant , one observer is stationed at the cathetometer , which is set to the fixed point h , while another , by means of the fine screw S ' , pushes the mercury ( always a very little up ) to the proper height for the cathetometer-setting .
By making the mercury always rise , a uniform capillary action is secured .
The cathetometer-observer then records the height of the mercury in T ' .
Suppose this to be higher than h , the difference between the level of the mercury in the two tubes , added to the barometric pressure , will give us the pressure of the air in the bulb B. Mr. GEORGE WIIPPLE , meteorological assistant at Kew , an exceedingly accurate and delicate observer , took most of the cathetometerand barometer-readings in these experiments .
It has been found that for a length of 30 inches the cathetometer-measurement requires a correction of + 003 inch , or for a difference of 11 inches + -001 nearly .
This has been attended to in reducing the experiments .
The bore of the tube T ' is about *25 inch , that of the tube T at h is generally smaller ; the capillary correction is ascertained after the bulb is detached , and the same atmospheric pressure acts on the 431 surface of mercury in both tubes , by setting the mercury in T to the height h , and then reading by means of the cathetometer the height of the fluid in T ' .
In the first set of experiments the capillary correction has been found to be insensible .
The following Table exhibits the results of this series of experiments .

Second Series of Experiments .
On December 22 , 1862 , the bulb used in the first series of experiments was detached , and another , containing a little anhydrous barytes , was put in its place .
In a couple of days the air in this bulb seemed to have become sufficiently dried ; while there could be no suspicion of vapour of mercury having in this time distilled over into the bulb through a capillary tube of the length of 9 inches , and while the bulb remained at the same temperature as the other parts of the apparatus .
The bulb also was not calibrated before use , nor did any mercury come in contact with it until after the experiments about to be described .
It was finally calibrated in the usual way .
The tubes T , T ' were the same as those used in the last experiment , and the capillary correction was inappreciable .
The result obtained by this bulb is recorded in the following Table : TABLE III.-Results from second Bulb .

and IV .
, that the value of 1 +180a is apparently increased *00025 by forcing in the mercury .
For the first bulb this increase was '00033 ; and the difference between these numbers is probably owing to errors of observation : but the agreement is sufficiently close to show that the first bulb cannot have at first contained any vapour of mercury ; for , if it had , the difference caused by forcing in mercury , instead of being greater than that for the second bulb , should have been much less .
Third Series of Experiments .
The barytes bulb was now removed , and another bulb of flint glass , along with its own drying-arrangement and tube T , was attached to the apparatus .
The bulb was only calibrated after use , and had not come in contact with mercury until the experiments were finished .
Sulphuric acid was used instead of anhydrous phosphoric acid in the bulb b , and potash , as before , in b ' .
Unfortunately the capillary correction due to the setting at h was not determined in an unexceptionable manner ; but as the third series of experiments is precisely similar ( as regards the value of V ) to the fourth , to be hereafter described , we shall apply to the former the capillary correction for the fourth series as probably near the truth .
Accordingly , for equal pressures on both tubes , we shall suppose that T would have read -018 in .
lower than T ' .

It differs slightly from that found by REGNAULT , who makes it to be 1-3665 ; and although the difference is not great , I should have preferred to have agreed still more closely with this eminent authority , but I am unable to think of any source of error in these experiments .
Two sets of experiments were made in order to determine the freezing-point of mercury .
In these , in order to ensure the greatest possible amount of precision , it was estimated that the air in a portion of the capillary tube near the mercury had a temperature lower than that of the atmosphere .
The first set of experiments were made with the first bulb , and the second set with the third bulb .
Here the formula to be employed is 1+ aT P " 1+ kT7 v 1kt ' and the freezing-point of water now becomes the higher temperature .

93 F. , while on a standard Kew mercurial thermometer the reading was -38 ?
'2 F. It may perhaps be gathered from this that mercury , before beginning to freeze , slightly increases the rate at which it contracts ; but further experiments must be made with other mercurial thermometers before this can be accurately determined .
