On the Meteorolog-ical Observations made at the Apartzments of the Royal Society during the Years 1827 , 1828 , and 1829 .
By J. W. LUBBOCK , Esq. V.P. e Treas .
R.S. Read April 14 , 1831 .
THE phenomena which principally deserve attention connected with the science of meteorology , are : 1 .
The annual and diurnal variations of the barometer and thermometer , due to the action of the sun .
2 .
The variations of the barometer due to the moon , and dependent on her age .
3 .
The comparative temperature and barometrical pressure at different points of the earth 's surface , the isothermal lines , and lines of equal barometrical pressure .
4 .
The influence of the direction of the wind on the temperature and barometrical pressure .
5 .
Phenomena connected with the electrical state of the air , the aurora borealis , &amp;c. In order to determine the annual variations of the barometer , I have taken the mean of the observations in each month , made at the apartments of the Royal Society , during the years 1827 , 1828 , 1829 , and 1830 .
The results are given in the following Table , which shows the differences from the Inean* .
The two first columns result from these observations , reduced to 32 FAHR , , and corrected for capillarity .
The four other columns are deduced from Table 3 in the valuable work of M. BOUvARD C Sir les Observations Meteorologiques .

9.861 9.840 29.778 29.767 29.748 29.762 Thus the mean height of the barometer at 9 A.M. for January is 29.861 +.006 = 29.867 .
It may be remarked , that according to this Table , the annual variations appear to be independent of the diurnal variations .
The Paris observations present much greater regularity than those made here , which results perhaps from their greater number .
In order to determine the diurnal variations of the barometer , it is necessary that the observations should be repeated much more frequently in the course of the day than is done here at present .
The mean height of the barometer here at 9 in the morning is greater by.021 inch ( or about th of an inch ) , than at 3 in the afternoon ; and so regular is this diurnal variation , that considering the mean of each month separately for the years 1827 , 1828 , 1829 , and 1830 , there are only two cases in which the mean height is greater at 3 in the afternoon than at 9 in the morning .
The corresponding difference at Paris is.030 inch * .
In order to determine the fluctuations of the barometer due to the moon , it would have been desirable to possess many more observations ; but , unfortunately , previous to 1827 , the observations of the barometer at Somerset House seem not to have been made at stated times of the day , a condition which appears to me absolutely necessary , in order that meteorological observations may be applied to this or any other useful purpose , except that of serving at the time to prognosticate the weather , or but imperfectly to determine the correction due to the direction of the wind .
I was therefore obliged to confine myself to the years 1827 , 1828 , and 1829 .
The method which I have adopted with respect to these aerial tides is similar to that which I have used in order to determine the phenomena of the tides in the river Thames , and consists in classifying all the heights of the barometer , and taking their mean , which correspond to a particular age of the moon , defined by the circumstance of her transit taking place in a given half-hour of the day .
Thus all the days in the years 1827 , 1828 , and 1829 , were found when the moon passed the meridian between 12 and half past 12 , and the mean of the transits taken , which of course is nearly a quarter past 12 ; the heights of the barometer were then taken on the same days , and the mean taken ; and thus all the transits of the moon which occurred during the years 1827 , 1828 , and 1829 , were taken , and the corresponding observed heights of the barometer selected and compared with them .
The height of the attached thermometer was also taken , and the mean height of the barometer corrected afterwards by the mean height of the attached thermometer , so as to reduce it to 32 ?
FAHR. Although the transits of the moon were at first classed for every half-hour , I afterwards combined them for every hour , in order to make use of a greater number of observations in obtaining results .
The mean transit thus found , scarcely differed from the half-hour , which is therefore taken as the time of the moon 's transit in the following Table , in which the results are exhibited .

29.781 29.748 The results afforded by the observations at Somerset House differ widely from those above obtained by M. BOUVARD from the observations at the Paris Observatory ; according to the former , the barometer is highest at new and full moon and lowest at quadrature ; according to the latter , the contrary is the case .
The extent of the fluctuations of the barometer due to the moon according to the former is about.08 or nearly Loth of an inch , according to the latter only '05 or olth of an inch .
They agree in this , that the fluctuations take place nearly in the same manner in the morning and in the afternoon ; whence it follows , that the period of the principal inequality of the height of the barometer due to the action of the moon is not the same as that of the ocean ; for if it were so , as the observations are made at a distance of six hours , the maximum in the morning would correspond to the minimum in the afternoon .
LAPLACE enumerates among the most important causes of the fluctuation of the pressure of the atmosphere , the rising and falling of the ocean due to the action of the sun and moon , the ocean serving as the basis or support of the atmosphere .
But with that deference which is due to the authority of so great 2G2 227 a mathematician , I must confess that this cause does not appear to me adequate to produce any sensible effect ; for in the open sea the variations of the height of the water due to the tides , where this cause would be most felt , do not exceed three or four feet , and any considerable rise of the tide is in general confined within very narrow limits , as in channels and between the banks of rivers .
Lastly , I have endeavoured to ascertain how far the barometer is affected by the direction of the wind and the following Table gives the results which I have obtained with this view .
The fluctuation due to this is much greater than that due to any other cause ; and it is therefore very important that this correction should be carefully ascertained , in order that it may be applied when observations of the barometer are classed , in order to determine any other inequality .
The barometer is lowest , as might be expected , in the rainy quarters , as S.W. and W.S.W. TABLF sIhowing results deduced from the Meteorological Observations made at Somerset House during the years 1827 , 1828 , and 1829 , classed according to the direction of the Wind .

863 29.835 I shall not attempt to enter into any discussion of the influence of electrical phenomena upon the weather ; no observations with reference to this part of the subject have yet been made here .
I have to acknowledge the very kind assistance of Mr. DEACON , ( to whom I have been indebted before , ) in forming the Tables which accompany this paper .
I have not discussed the circumstances under which the observations have been made which serve for the foundation of the results which are here presented , although I fear that the instruments employed are unworthy of the Society and of the care bestowed upon the observations by Mr. HUDSON .
This discussion would have been necessary if my object had been to determine the mean temperature or the mean barometrical pressure at London ; but as I have only endeavoured to ascertain the fluctuations of the barometer due to certain causes , whose periods are independent of any errors that may arise from the construction and condition of the instruments , those errors are of little importance in the preceding investigation .
Since this paper was read , Mr. HUDSON has made some observations with a view to determine the diurnal variation of the barometer ; they were begun on the 26th of April , and have been continued to the present time , June 13th .
