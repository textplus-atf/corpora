" Further Observations in favour of the View that Nervefibres never end in Voluntary Muscle .
" By LIONEL S. BEALE , M.B. , F.R.S. , Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians , Professor of Physiology and of General and Morbid Anatomy in King 's College , London ; Physician to King 's College Hospital , &amp;c. Received June 5 , 1863 .
Few anatomical inquiries of late years have excited more interest than the present one .
Since my paper published in the 'Philosophical Transactions ' for the year 1860 , several memoirs have appeared in Germany .
In my paper just published in the last volume of the 'Transactions , ' I have replied to the statements of Kiihne and K61liker , but I had not succeeded in actually tracing the very fine nucleated fibres I had demonstrated from one undoubted nerve-trunk to another .
As a demonstration , therefore , my conclusions were defective , though the only explanation to be offered of facts I had observed was that included in the view I propounded in my first paper .
The question between my opponents and myself upon this matter is not one of interpretation , but a question of simple fact .
I assert that the fine nerve-fibres can be followed much further than the point where Kiihne and Kolliker maintain the ends or termina668 June 18 , tions are situated , if the specimen be so prepared as to prevent destruction of these most delicate fibres , and the refractive power of the medium be such as to enable us to see them .
I propose to present to the Royal Society next session a paper in which I shall demonstrate the truth of the conclusions I have arrived at ; but as my specimens are already prepared , and during the last few months several drawings have been made , I hasten to give a short statement of facts , in order that those who have been led to conclusions opposed to my own may have an opportunity of studying the very same muscle .
The great width and refractive power of the large elementary fibres of the pectoral of the common frog render it impossible to follow for any great distance amongst them nerve-fibres of the 61 th of an inch = -000187 " ' in diameter ; and I have there .
fore long been searching for a very thin voluntary muscle , with fine fibres , which , like the bladder of the frog , could be examined without the necessity of making thin sections , and thereby deranging the relation of all the finest and most delicate structures .
Such a muscle I have found in the extensive mylo-hyoid of the little green tree-frog ( Hyla arborea ) .
The elementary fibres of this muscle are scarcely more than the 3o1th of an inch = -0036 " ' in diameter ; and as there are but two layers , the fibres of which are at right angles to each other , all the structures in the muscle can be demonstrated most beautifully .
The very long thin muscular fibres are not too close for exact observation .
The vessels can be readily injected.* These specimens have been prepared upon the same plan as others , and are preserved in glycerine , which enables me to press the thin muscle and separate the fibres further from each other , while the finest fibres of the nerves are prevented , by the viscid medium , from breaking or from being so compressed amongst the other tissues as to be destroyed or rendered invisible .
The muscle must be prepared when quite fresh , otherwise the fine nucleated fibres are completely disintegrated .
The capillaries were injected as in the other cases* .
In this thin muscle , networks formed by bundles of dark-bordered fibres , consisting of from two to five or six , may be very easily shown , and with high powers ( 700 to 3000 diameters ) the very fine nucleated fibres resulting from the division and subdivision of these in a dichotomous t manner , can be readily demonstrated .
In this thin muscle I have often followed individual fine nucleated nerve-fibres , now over , now under muscular fibres , sometimes crossing transversely , sometimes obliquely , and sometimes running for a certain distance parallel to the fine muscular fibre .
The drawing accompanying this paper renders further description unnecessary .
I shall enter into full detail in my communication next session ; but as the summer is the period to obtain specimens of the Hyla , I am anxious my fellow-labourers in Germany should at once be acquainted with the advantages of the thin muscle alluded to ; and I cannot too strongly recommend this beautiful little frog , which they have the advantage of procuring more readily than Englishmen , for microscopical investigation .
All the tissues are beautifully distinct , and I challenge those who are interested in these questions to discuss them with me , selecting the tissues of this animal for special study .
EXPLANATION OF THE PLATE .
Distribution offinest nucleated nerve-fibres to the very narrow elementary muscular fibres of the mylo-hyoid of the little green tree-frog ( Hyla arborea),.magnified 1700 diameters .
Drawn on the block by the author .
The elementary muscular fibres are marked g , h , i , 7c .
k is a very young one , slightly stretched ; i is a fully-formed muscular fibre ; h , another stretched in its central part .
The nuclei of these fibres exhibit some differences in size and form .
Nucleoli are distinct in all , and in the fibre marked g the nuclei , which were.coloured by carmine , exhibit three different intensities of colour , the dark central spot , " nucleolus , " being most intensely coloured , as indicated by the shading in the drawing .

/ " ~ , j / " \ a is a nerve-fibre which was followed over more than twenty elementary muscular fibres from a dark-bordered fibre .
One of the subdivisions of this fibre is seen atf , where it again runs with a very fine dark-bordered fibre ( o ) .
The darkbordered fibre ( o ) was some distance higher up in the specimen , but its place has been altered in order to avoid the necessity for a still larger drawing .
Above ba nucleus of a very fine nerve-fibre is seen .
Such nuclei lie upon the surface of the muscular fibres , external to the sarcolemma .
The nucleus often appears as if it were within the sarcolemma ( c ) , but the fibres proceeding from each extremity render such a position impossible .
The relation of these nerve-nuclei to the sarcolemma is seen at I in profile .
The nuclei , as well as the fibres for a certain distance , often adhere to the sarcolemma very firmly ; but in the thin mylo-hyoid muscle the course of the fibres over or under , but always external to the muscular fibres , may be readily traced if the muscular fibres be separated slightly from each other , as represented in the drawing .
At d fine nerve-fibres accompanying the fine fibre continued from the darkbordered fibre , as described in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' for 1862 , are represented .
Such fibres are also seen at e and f. m , n , and o dark-bordered fibres , with nuclei near their distribution .
m would probably pass over sixty or seventy muscular fibres , and n over perhaps twenty , before it divided into fibres as fine as those seen at b , e , f , 1 .
pa very fine capillary vessel with a nerve-fibre running close to it .
qa bundle composed of six very fine nerve-fibres near their distribution .
These fibres exhibit a very distinctly beaded appearance , which is also observed in many other fine fibres in different parts of the specimen .
Traces of connective tissue are seen in all parts near the fine nerve-fibres and around the muscular fibres .
Here and there some very fine connective tissuefibres , which were not altered by acetic acid , are represented .
These represent the remains of fine nerve-fibres , which existed in a state of functional activity at an earlier period .
The drawing , with the exception of the position of the nerve-fibre ( o ) above mentioned , is an actual copy from nature .
The relative position of the muscular fibres , the form and general characters of the so-called nuclei , and the position and size of the nerve-fibres and their nuclei have been carefully preserved .
I have traced the very fine nerve-fibres in so many instances from one trunk to another ramifying at a very considerable distance , that I cannot believe any true terminations or ends exist .
