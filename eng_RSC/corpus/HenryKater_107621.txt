An account of the re-measurement of the cube , cylinder , and sphere , used by the late Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYN , in his enquiries respecting a standard of weights and measures .
By Captain HENRY KATER , F. R. S. Read June 7 , 1821 .
1 HE valuable experiments made by the late Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYN , for the determination of a standard of weights and measures , are detailed in the Philosophical Transactions for 1798 .
It may there be seen that a cube , a cylinder , and a sphere of brass were employed , the respective dimensions of which being given , as well as the weight of water displaced by each , the weight of a cubic inch of distilled water might thence be readily ascertained .
In reviewing these'experiments , so much care appears to have been bestowed on those parts of the enquiry which relate to weight , as to leave no reason to doubt their accuracy ; but as SIR GEORGE SHUCKBURGH has not entered into so full a detail of the method he pursued in the measurement of the cube , the cylinder , and the sphere , I felt it to be desirable that this operation should be repeated , before the Commissioners of Weights and Measures should make their final Report .
The Honourable CHARLES C. JENKINSON , to whom the valuable apparatus of the late Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH now belongs , very obligingly confided it to the care of the Commissioners .
I found the sphere in the most perfect state of preservation .
The cube and the cylinder were in some parts covered with an oxide , which was , however , readily removed without their sustaining any injury , by a very weak mixture of sulphuric acid and water .
Two small rectangular pieces of plate brass were prepared , of the same size , and about the tenth of an inch thick ; one of the surfaces and one side of each were ground perfectly flat , and the surfaces being placed in contact , two fine dots were made on the plane sides , close to the edges , as in the accompanying figure .
These pieces were intended * : .
to be applied to the extremities of the object to be __ measured , the dots serving as points , the distance between which was to be ascertained .
In order to keep the brass pieces in their proper position , and at the same time to ensure , in every case , an equal pressure , two springs were made to slide along a mahogany rule , divided into inches .
These springs projected nearly at right angles from the rule , and being set at the required distance from each other , retained by their pressure the brass pieces steadily in the situation in which they were placed .
The micrometer microscope used on this occasion , differed essentially from that which is commonly employed .
The microscope itself was carried along by the micrometer screw , instead of the motion being-confined to its cross wires .
By this construction , which was suggested by Dr. YOUNG , no error could arise from the image not being in the same plane with the wires ; and it gave me , besides , the advantage of applying an object-glass , of whatever power I pleased , to the microscope , without altering the value of the divisions of the micrometer .
Having placed the rectangular pieces of brass , with their surfaces in contact , and the sides on which the dots were made in the same plane , they were confined in this position between the springs before described .
The following observations were then made with the 31t7 incrometer microscope to determine the distance between the dots .

For a particular description of the cube , sphere , and cylinder , I shall beg leave to refer the reader to Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH'S paper in the Philosophical Transactions for 1798 ; and for the correction of some errors in computation , to a paper by J. FLETCHER , Esq. given in the 4th vol. of NICHOLSON'S Journal , 8vo .
The letters used in the following detail , indicate the same parts as in Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH'S paper .
The letters and lines made by Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH on the cube , sphere , and cylinder , in black lead pencil , still remained , and afforded the means of examining each step in succession .
Great care was taken by leaving the apparatus together more than 24 hours , and by other precautions , to guard against errors which might arise from difference of temperature ; and the same portions of Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH'S standard scale were used , as were employed by himself .
The microscopes were attached to a strong frame of well seasoned wood , and were transferred from the dots to the scale at each reading .
Measurement of the cube .
The brass pieces being properly placed , the excess of the distance between the dots and 5 inches , taken upon the standard scale between 27 and 32 , was measured by the micrometer .
This being added to 5 inches , and,0296582 subtracted , we have the length of the side of the cube .

Measurement of the cylinder .
Each of the ends of the cylinder was crossed by Sir G. SHUCKBURGH by two diameters , the extremities of which were connected by lines drawn parallel to its axis .
These lines , as well as the letters indicating their terminations , were distinctly visible .
Length of the cylinder .
The brass pieces being properly arranged , the excess of the distance between the dots and 6 inches , taken upon the scale between 5s,1 and 58,1 was measured , which being added to 6 inches , and , oQs6582 deducted , we obtain the length of the cylinder .

Diameter of the cylinder .
The brass pieces were most carefully placed , so that the dots were precisely in the direction of the diameters , and the surfaces tangents to the circumference .
The distance between the dots was then compared with 4 inches on the scale , from 54 to 58 , and the diameter obtained in the manner before described , Cylinder .

Measurement of the sphere .
On referring to Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH'S account , it will be seen , that for the measurement of the sphere , a brass square was employed , the side of which was a very little longer than the diameter of the sphere .
The sphere being placed within the square , and properly supported , a micrometer screw , which passed through one of the sides of the square , was brought in contact with the diameter of the sphere , and the reading of the micrometer head noted .
The sphere being then removed , a brass rule of known length was put in its place , and the micrometer screw being brought in contact with the end of the rule , the difference between its length and the diameter of the sphere was obtained , from which the latter could , of course , be readily determined .
Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH had drawn three great circles in pencil upon the sphere , which , as well as the letters designating their intersections , remained perfect .
Having arranged the apparatus , the following measurements of the diameter of the sphere were taken , two of which may be termed equatorial , and the third polar , every precaution being used to prevent errors arising from difference of temperature .

Length of the brass rule .
The brass rule was laid upon the standard scale , where it remained for two days before the measurement was made , in order that it might acquire the same temperature .
The rectangular pieces of brass were then applied to its extremities , and the distance between the dots compared with the distance from 26 to 32 inches upon the scale , in the manner which has been before described .

It may now be useful to collect under one view the data furnished by Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH'S experiments , and by the preceding measurements .
