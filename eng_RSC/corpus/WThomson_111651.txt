" Measuremenlit of the Electromotive Force required to produce a Spark in Air betweeni parallel metal plates at different distanices .
" By Professor W. THOINISON , F.R.S. Received Janiuary 26 , 1860 .
The electrometers used in this investigation were the absolute electroieter and the portable electrometer described in my last communication to the Royal Society , and the operations were executed by the same gentlemeni , Mr. Smith and Mr. Ferguison .
Theconductors between which the sparks passed were two unvarnislhed plates of a condenser , of which one was moved by a mnicrometer screw , giving a motion of ' Aj , of an itinlc per turn , and having its h(ad divided into 40 equal parts of circumfereniee .
The readings on the screw-head could be readily taken to tenth iparts of a division , that is to say , to of an iiech on the distance to be measured .
The point from which the spark would pass in successive trials being somewhat variable and ofteui near the edges of the discs , a thiln flat piece of metal , made very slightly convex on its upper surface like an extremely flat watch .
glass , was laid on the lower plate .
It was then found that the spark always passed betweell the crown of this convex piece of metal and the flat upper plate .
The curvature of the former was so small , that the phy sic al circumstances of its ownl electrification near its crown , the opposite electrificationi of the opposed flat surface in the parts near the crown of the convex , and the electric pn , ssure on or tension in the air between them could not , it was supposed , differ scensibly from those between two plan-e conducting surfaces at the same distauce and maintained at the same difference of pot-entials .
The readii6g of the screw-bead corresponding to the position of the moveable disc , was always determined electrically by making a sueccssion of sparlks pass , and approacLing the moveable disc griadually by the screw until all appearance of sparks ceased .
Contact was thus produced without any force of pressuire between the two bodies capable of sensibly distorting their supports .
With these arranigements several series of experiments were made , in which the differenices of potentials producing sparks across different thicklnesses of air were measured first by the absolute electrometer , and afterwards by the portable torsion electrometer .
The followig , Tables exlhibit the results hitherto obtained .

When it is considered that the absolute electrification of each of the opposed sturfacest depenids simply on the electromotive force per unit length of the space between them , or , which is the same thing , thel resultant electrostatic force in the air occupying that space , it is difficult even to conjecture an explanation .
Without attempting to explain it , we are forced to recognize the fact that a thin stratum of air is stronger than a thick one against the same disruptive tensioni in the air , according to Faraday 's view of its condition as traiismitting electric force , or against the same lifting electric pressure from its bounding surfaces , according to the views of the 180i eent tury school , as represented by Poisson .
The same conclusion is established by a series of experiments with the previouslv-described portable torsioni electrometer substituted for the absolute electrometer , leading to results shown in the following Table .

So far as it goes , it agrees remarkably well with the other experiments exhibited in Table I. , as is showni by the following comparative Table , in which , along with results of actual observation extracted from Table II .

Force of gravity at Glasgow on unit mass = 32-2 dycnamical units of force ; that is to say , generates in one seconcd a velocity of 32-2 feet per second .
t This is most directly obtained by finding the force between the discs of the absolute electrometer per square foot , and reducing , according to the inverse proportion of sqnares of distances , to what it would have beenif the distance between thelml had beenequal to the length of the spark .
APPEN DIX .
In order that the different expressions , " potential , " '1 electromotive force , " " 'electrostatic force , " " pressure of electricity from a metallic surface balanced by air , " used in the preceding statement , may be perfectly uniderstood , I add the following explanations and definitions beloniging to the ordinary elements of the mathematical theory of electricity .
1 .
Measurement of qtantities of electricity.-The unit quantity of electricity is such a quantity , that , if collected in a point , it will repel an equal quiantity collected in a point at a unit distanlce with a force equal to unity .
[ In British absolute measurements the unit distance is one foot ; and the unit force is that force which , acting on a grain of matter during a secon*d of time , generates a velocity of onie foot per second .
The weight of a grain at Glasgow is 32-2 of these British units of force .
The weight of a grain in any part of the earth 's surface niay be estimnated with about .
as mtuch accuracy as it cau be without a special experiment to determine it for the particular locality , by the following expression : In latitude A average weight of a grain -32 088 x(1+ -00v 133 x sin]2 x ) Biritish absolute units .
] 2 .
Electric deisit .
This term was introduced by Coulomb to desigonate the quantity of electricity per unit of area in any l)art of the surface of a conductor .
Ile showed how to measure it , though not in absollute measure , by his proof platne .
3 .
Resdltant electric force at any point in an insulating fluid .
The resultant force at any point in air or other insulating fluid in the neighbourhood of an electrified body , is the force which a unit of electricity concentrated at that point would experience if it exercised no influence on the electric distributionis in its neighbourhood .
4 .
Relation bet veen electric cdensity on the su:face of a conductor , and electric for at points inz the air close to it.-According to a proposition of Couilomb 's , requiriino , , hbowever , correction , and first correctly given by Laplace , the resultant force at any point in the air close to the surface of a conductor is perpendicular to the surfiace and equal to 4rp , if p denotes the electric denisity of the surface in the nieighbourhood .
5 ) .
Electric press re.from the sio face of a concluctor balanced bI 111r.-A thini mlPetallic sh(l or liquid filmii , as for instfancea soap-bubble , if electrified , experiences a real mechanical force in a direction perpendicular to the surface outwards , equal in amount per unit of area to 2rp ' , p denoting , as before , the electric density at the part of the surface considered .
This force may be called either a repulsion ( as according to the views of the eighteenth century school ) or an attractioi effected by tension of air between the surface of the conductor and the conducting boundary of the air in which it is insulated , as it would probably be considered to be by Faraday ; but whatever may be the explanation of the modus operandi by which it is produced , it is a real mechanical force , and may be reckoned as in Col. 5 of the preceding Table , in grains weight per square inch or per square foot .
In the case of the soap-bubble , for instance , its effect will be to cause a slight enlargement of the bubble on electrification with either vitreous or resinious electricity , and a corresponding collapse on being perfectly discharged .
In every case we may regard it as constituting a deduction from the amount of air-pressure which the body experiences when unelectrified .
The amount of this deduction being different in differelt parts accordinag to the square of the electric density , its resultant action on the wh:ole body distuLrbs its equilibrium , and constitutes in fact the resultant electric force experienced by the body .
6 .
Collected formulae of relation between electric density on the suaSface of a conductor , electric diminutiot of air-pressure po it , and resultant force in the air close to the sufiace.-Let , as before , p denote the first of these three elements , let p denote the second reckoned in units of force per unit of area , and let R denote the third .
Then we have R=47rp , p=27rp2=R ' .
7 .
Electric _potential.-The amount of work requiired to move a unit of electricity against electric repulsion from any one position to any other position , is equal to the excess of the electric potential of the first positioni above the electric potential oL the second positionl .
Cor. 1 .
The electric potential at all points close to the suLirface of an electrified metallic body has one value , since an electrified point , possessing so small a quanitity of electricity as not sensibly to influence the electrificationi of the metallic surfface , would , if held near the surface in any locality , experience a force perpendicular to the surifce in its nei , -hbourhood .
C(or .
2 .
The electric potential throughout the interior of a hollow metallic body , electrified in any way by external influence , or , if insulated , electrified either by influence or by communication of electricity to it , is constant , since there is no electric force in the interior in such circumstances .
[ It is easily shown by mathematical investigation , that the electric force experienced by an electric point containing an infinitely small quantity of electricity , when placed anywhere in the neighbourhood of a hollow electrified metallic shell , gradually diminishes to nothing if the electric point be moved gradually from the exterior through a small aperture in the shell into the interior .
Hence the one value of the potential close to the surface outside , mentioned in Cor. 1 , is equal to the constant value throughout the interior mentioned in .

Interpretation .
of measurement 6y electroreter.-Every kind of electrometer consists of a cage or case colntaining a moveable and a fixed conductor , of which one at least is insulated and put in metallic communication , by what I shall call the principal electrode passing through an aperture in the case or cage , with the conductor whose electricity is to be tested .
In every properly constructed electrometer , the electric force experienced by the moveable part in a given position cannot be electrically influenced except by changing the difference of potentials between the principal electrode and the uninsulated conductor or conducting system in the electrometer .
Even the best of ordinary electrometers hitherto constructed do not fulfil this condition , as the inner surface of the glass of which the whole or part of the enclosing case is generally made , is liable to become electrified , and inevitably dloes become so when any very high electrification is designedly or accidentally introduced , even for a very short time ; the consequence of which is that the moving body will generally not return to its zero position when the principal electrode is perfectly disinsulated .
Faraday long ago showed how to obviate this radical defect by coating the interior of the glass case with a fine network of tinfoil ; and it seems strange that even at the present day electrometers for scientific research , as for instance for the investigationi of atmospheric electricity , should be constructed with so bad and obvious a defect uncured by so simple and perfect a remedy .
Wlihen it is desired to leave the interior of the electrometer as much light as possible , and to allow it to be clearly seen from any external position with as little enmbarrassment as possible , a cage made like a bird 's cage , with an extremely fine wire on a metal frame , inside the glass shade used to protect the instrument from currents of air , &amp;c. , may be substituted with advantage for the tinfoil network lining of the glass .
It appears therefore that a properly colnstructed electrometer is an instrument for measuring , by means of the motions of a moveable conductor , the difference of potentials of two conducting systems insulated from one another , of one of which the case or cage of the apparatus forms part .
It may be remarked in passing , that it is sometimes coonvenient in special researches to insulate the case or cage of the apparatuLs , and allow it to acquire a potential differing from that of the earth , and that then , as always , the subject of measurement is the di ference of potentials between the prinicipal electrode and the case or cage , while in the ordiniary use of the instrument the potential of the latter is the same as that of the earth .
Hence we may regard the electrometer merely as an instrument for measuring differences of potential between two conducting systems miitually insulated ; and the object to be aimed at in per .
feecting any kind of electrometer ( more or less sensitive as it may be , according to the subjects of investigation for which it is to be used ) , is , that accucate evalu(ations in a6solute measure , of digfferences of potential , may be immecdiately derivable from its indications .

Relation between electrostatic force and variation of electric potential.- ? ?
7 , otherwise stated , is equivalent to this:-The average com.ponent electrostatic force in the straight line of air between two points in the neighbourhood of an electrified body is equal to their difference of pote utials divided by their distance .
In other words , the rate of variation of electric potential per nnit of length in any direction , is equal to the component of the electrostatic force in that direction .
Since the average electrostatic force in the line joining two points at which the values of the potential are equal , is nothing , the direction of the resuiltant electrostatic force at any point must be perpendicnlar to the equipotential surface passing through that point ; or the lines of force ( which are generally curves ) cut the series of equipotential surfaces at right auigles .
The rate of variation of potential per unit of length along a line of force is therefore equal to the electrostatic force at any point .
10 .
Stratum of air between two parallel or nearly parallel plane or cutrved metallic surfaces maintained at differentpotentials.-Let a denote the distance between the metallic surfaces on each side of the stratum of air at any part , and V the difference of potentials .
It is easily shown that the resultant electrostatic force is sensibly constant through the whole distance , from the one surface to the other ; and being in a direction sensibly perpendicular to each , it must ( ? ?
9 ) V be equal to .
Eence ( ? ?
4 ) the electric density on each of the a~~~ opposed surfaces is equal to Y-- .
This is Green 's theory of the 4vra Leyden phial .
11 .
Absolute Electrometer.-As a particular case of No. 10 , let the discs be plane and parallel ; and let the distance between them be small in comparison with their diameters , or with the distanice of any part of either from any conductor differing from it in potential .
The electric density will be uniform over the whole of each of the opposed surfaces and equal to jv , being positive on one and negative on the other ; and in all other parts of the surface of each the electrification will be comparatively insensible .
Hence the force of attraction between them per unit of area ( ? ? ? ?
5 and 6 ) will be 8V as if A denote the area of either of the opposed surfaces ; the whole force of attraction between them is therefore A V( Hence , if the observed force be equal to the weight of w grains at Glasgow , we have 32-2 x w=A 8wA and therefore V==aV/ 322 xw Addition , dated April 12 , 1860 .
Experiments on precisely the same plan as those of Table I. December 13 , have been repeated by the same two experimenters , with different distances from *3 to *6 of an inch between the plates of the absolute electrometer , and results have been obtained confirming the general character of those shown in the preceding Tables .
The absolute evaluations derived from these later series , must be more accurate than those deduced above from the single series of December 13 , when the distance between the plates in the absolute electrometer was only *2 of an inch .
I therefore by permission add the following Table of absolute determinations : Electrostatic forces according to I Length of spark i estimated average of determina-i in inches .

It seems most probable that at still greater distances the electrostatic force will be found to be sensibly constant , as it was certainly expected to be at all distances .
The limiting value to which the results shown in the last Table seem to point must be something not much less than 2800 .
This corresponds to a pressure of 9600 grains weight per square foot .
We may therefore conclude that the ordinary atmospheric pressure of 14,798,000 grains per square foot , is electrically relieved by the subtraction of 9600 on two very slightly convex metallic surfaces , at a distance of Jlth of an inch or more , before the air between them is cracked and a spark passes .
By taking into account the result of my preceding conmunication to the Royal Society , we may also conclude that a Daniell 's battery of 5510 elements can produce a spark between two slightly convex metallic surfaces at 1 th of an inch asunder in ordinary atmospheric air .
