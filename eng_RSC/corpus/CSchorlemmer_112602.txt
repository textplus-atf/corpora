The light oils obtained by the destructive distillation of Cannel-coal at a low temperature , contain , besides the hydrocarbons of the marsh-gas and benzol series , other substances , which are attacked by concentrated sulphuric acid .
If the oil , which has been repeatedly shaken with this acid , be subjected to distillation , the hydrocarbons which are unacted upon volatilize first , and a black tarry liquid , equal in bulk to about half the crude oil , remains behind t. On heating this residue more strongly , a brown oil , having an unpleasant smell , comes over at about 200 ?
C. ; the temperature rises gradually up to 300 ?
C. , and at last a black pitchy mass is left in the retort .
Even after repeated rectifications the oil always leaves a solid black residue behind , and it was only by continued fractional distillations over solid caustic potash and metallic sodium , that I succeeded in isolating substances possessing nearly a constant boiling-point and volatilizing almost completely .
The compounds which I thus obtained from Cannel-coal oil , boiling below 120 ?
C. , are hydrocarbons of the general formula ( C , , H_2)2 , as the following analyses and determinations of the vapour-densities show:* ' The boiling-point of acetate of amyl is given very differently by different observers ( Cahours found 125 ?

] 133 These hydrocarbons are colourless , oily , strongly refracting liquids , lighter than water , and possessing a faint peculiar smell , resembling that of the roots of Daucus carota or Pastinaca sativa .
I have obtained them in small quantities only , and could study their reactions therefore only incompletely .
They combine with bromine with a hissing noise , and if the reaction is not moderated , the liquid blackens and hydrobromic acid is evolved ; but by keeping the substance well cooled , and by adding the bromine very carefully , nearly colourless , heavy , oily , sweet-smelling bromine-compounds are obtained , without the formation of hydrobromic acid .
These are very easily decomposed by heating ; charry matter separates out , and hydrobromic acid is given off even below the boiling-point of water .
From the hydrocarbon C 4H 2 alone I obtained a sufficient quantity of the bromide for analysis .
0'3715 substance gave 0 3605 bromide of silver and 0 0123 metallic silver .
Calculated for Found .
C14 H24 Br2 .
45'45 per cent. Br .
43'7 per cent. Br .
As it was impossible to purify the small quantity of bromide , the difference between the found and calculated quantities is easily accounted for .
Concentrated nitric acid dissolves these hydrocarbons , much heat being evolved ; on diluting the acid solution with water , yellow , heavy , thick oily nitro-compounds separate , which have a faint but peculiarly unpleasant smell .
By heating these nitro-compounds with tin and hydrochloric acid , a portion is converted into a black tarry mass , and the solution contains a considerable quantity of chloride of ammonium , and a small quantity of a hydrochlorate , which can be obtained as a crystalline deliquescent mass by evaporating in vacuo .
On concentrating the solution in the air , decomposition takes place , a violet substance being formed .
By adding caustic potash to the solution of the hydrochlorate , a dark oily base separates , which quickly oxidizes into a black tarry mass .
Platinic chloride produces at first no precipitate in the concentrated solution of the hydrochlorate , but after a few minutes a dark violet tar separates .
I could not succeed in obtaining crystallized double chlorides of tin or zinc , If these hydrocarbons are heated with a concentrated solution of bichromate of potassium and sulphuric acid , carbonic acid is evolved , a strongly acid liquid , on which an oily layer swims , distils over , a resinous substance remaining in the retort .
As I did not'obtain any of the pure hydrocarbons in sufficient quantity to study their separate products of oxidation , I took all that remained , together with the intermediate distillates , and the oil boiling above 280 ?
C. , which had been previously well purified by rectification over sodium .
After oxidation , the distillate was neutralized with carbonate of sodium , the oil being left undissolved .
This neutral oil , which has an ethereal smell , and boils between 200 ?
and 300 ?
C. , gave on analysis 84'9 per cent. C and 11-8 per cent. I ; it consists , therefore , of non-oxidized hydrocarbons , containing a small quantity of an oxygencompound .
The solution of the sodium-salt was evaporated on the waterbath , the residue distilled with diluterl sulphuric acid , and the distillate rectified .
It smelt strongly of acetic acid , and also slightly of butyric acid .
By neutralization with carbonate of sodium , a crop of crystals of acetate of sodium was obtained , which were converted into the crystallized silversalt .
0-1335 of this salt gave 0'861 of silver .
Calculated for Found .
C2 13 Ag 02 .
64'67 per cent. Ag .
64'50 per cent. Ag .
The syrupy mother-liquor of the sodium-salt gave , with nitrate of silver , a white precipitate , which , on boiling the liquid , decomposed with effervescence and separation of metallic silver , showing the presence of formic acid ; from the filtered liquid small warty crystals of a silver-salt separated .
0'1314 of this salt gave 0'842 of silver , or 64'1 per cent. Ag .
The mother-liquor gave on evaporation again crystals of acetate of silver .
0'2196 gave 0'1418 silver , or 64'56percent .
The volatile acids produced by the oxidation of the hydrocarbons are therefore carbonic acid , acetic acid , formic acid , and perhaps a trace of an acid richer in carbon .
The resinous substance left in the retort is an acid which dissolves in caustic potash , and is precipitated from this solution as a brown greasy substance , easily soluble in alcohol .
The alcoholic solution , neutralized with ammonia , gave , with nitrate of silver , a white flocculent precipitate of a silver-salt , which dried into a brown resinous mass , not fit for analysis .
As these hydrocarbons were obtained by the action of sulphuric acid on coal-tar oils boiling below 120 ?
, and as they differ by C , H1 , it appears to me almost certain that they are polymers of the hydrocarbons of the acetylene series , C , H2 , -2 , formed in the same way as diamylene is formed , by treating amylene with sulphuric acid .
The products of oxida .
tion are also in accordance with this view .
In order to test this theory , I have made some experiments with the two isomers C6 Ho1 , namely , diallyl and hexoylene .
By acting with sulphuric acid on these compounds , I obtained , besides large quantities of tarry matter , polymeric modifications boiling above 200 ?
, having a smell similar to the hydrocarbons described above , giving also similar nitro .
compounds ; but the quantities which I got were not large enough for a more exact examination .
The sulphuric acid which was used to purify the coal-tar oils contains an organic substance in solution , which can be isolated by neutralizing the acid liquid with carbonate of calcium , filtering , evaporating to dryness in the water-bath , extracting the residue with alcohol , and evaporating the alcoholic solution .
It forms a yellow amorphous mass , which has a faint , bitter , and astringent taste .
A substance with exactly the same properties was obtained from the acid which was used to act upon the hydrocarbons C Hl , .
I am at present engaged upon experiments to isolate the hydrocarbons Cn H12n-2 contained in coal-tar .
