On certain changes zwhich appear to have taken place in thepositions of some of the principal fixed Stars .
By JOHN POND , Astronomer Royal , F. R. S. Read June 19 , i82s .
SINCE the date of my last communication on the subject of the deviation of the fixed stars from their computed or predicted places , I have been induced to examine such intermediate observations , as appeared likely to throw some light on this difficult subject .
The observations that best deserve attention since the time of BRADLEY , are the few which were made by the French astronomers , in their Trigonometrical Operations , about the year 1793 , and those of Greenwich , Armagh , Westbury and Palermo , some years later , as published in the Philosophical Transactions for the year i8o6 .
As the computations and tables relating to this investigation are subjoined , it will only be requisite , briefly , to state the result .
It appears to me , that these observations greatly add to the probability that some variation , either continued or periodical , takes place in the sidereal system , which , producing but very small deviations in a finite portion of time , has hitherto escaped notice .
That in consequence of this , it becomes impossible , even if two perfectly exact observations of a star could be made at distant intervals , either by interpolation to assign its place for any intermediate period , or to predict its place for the future , contrary to the theory hitherto received .
The nature of this motion appears to be such , that the stars are now mostly found a considerable quantity to the southward of their computed or predicted places .
With respect to the laws by which these motions are governed , the observations in question are not sufficiently exact to throw any light upon them .
Upon this very difficult point we must , I am inclined to think , rely chiefly , if not entirely , on the Greenwich observations ; and as I have already fully discussed this question in my former Paper , I am unwilling , particularly at this advanced period of the season , to trespass any longer on the attention of the Royal Society .
The French astronomers , in their Trigonometrical Operations , employed six stars , whose declinations for the year 1793 , they determined with a singular degree of precision with their repeating circle , viz. N. P. D. 1793 a Draconis 25 37 52 , o0 Urs .

The above are the best authorities that can be found from the time of BRADLEY to the year 18 13 .

TABLE I. is nearly the same as published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1806 .
The Greenwich Catalogue is corrected for flexure , and the other catalogues corrected each by a common quantity , so as to make the polar distance of y Draconis 8 ? ?
28 ' 54 " , the same as in the Greenwich Catalogue .
It may be doubted whether the Palermo Catalogue can , with any propriety , be introduced in this investigation , considering that the observations were made in a different latitude , and computed by a different table of refraction .
The discordances in these catalogues are very considerable , and show that very little reliance can be placed even on the most probable mean of them all .
TABLE II .
shows the southern motion , as deduced from the Greenwich Catalogue of 1800 , corrected for the flexure of the mural quadrant , TABLE III .
in the same manner , shows the southern motion deduced from the Westbury Catalogue .
TABLE IV .
shows the southern motion deduced from the mean of all the Catalogues .
From this Table it appears , that however doubtful the determination may be , as deduced from any particular star , yet the general tendency of motion to the southward is so obvious , as to leave but little room to doubt of its reality .
TABLE V. contains interpolated places for the years 1780 , 1790 , 18oo , 1813 .
These Tables are formed upon the supposition that no southern motion exists , but the proper motions 539 of all the stars are uniform : it moreover supposes the present Catalogue for 1823 exact .
It has been seen , that it is quite impossible to reconcile the very best catalogues to such a supposition ; as has been particularly exemplified in the observations of Greenwich and Dublin for the year 1813 .
The Greenwich Observations for that year will be found very erroneous , and those of Dublin still more so .
Indeed it appears to me that the Dublin observations cannot be placed in a more unfavourable point of view , than by supposing the southern motion in question not to exist .
TABLE VI , contains the Catalogues of MAYER and BRADEY ; the former is corrected by a common quantity 3",5 , which I find necessary to equalise the positive and negative dife ferences .
