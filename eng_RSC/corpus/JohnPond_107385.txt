Observation of the Summer Solstice , 18 , at the Royal Observatory .
By John Pond , Esq. Astronomer Royal , F. .
R. Read November i , 181 .
As it is intended that a minute description of the mural circle lately erected at the Royal Observatory , when completely finished , shall be laid before the Royal Society , I think it unnecessary to accompany this communication with any other remarks on its construction , than such as are absolutely necessary to render the annexed observations intelligible ; being only anxious to take an early opportunity of transmitting the result of the observations of the sun , made at the last summer solstice .
For , notwithstanding the instrument was at that time in a very unfinished and imperfect state , I have reason to think , that the observations made with it were much more exact than could have been made with any other instrument hitherto constructed : the uncertainty of the result , as far as the instrument itself is concerned , does not , I believe , exceed a small fraction of a second ; but I think it necessary to offer a few remarks on the elements of the computation , by which the result is obtained .
The distance of the sun from the pole at the moment of the solstice , may either be considered as a simple arc , or as composed of two others , namely , the distance of the sun from the zenith , and the distance of the zenith from the pole .
From the construction of instruments which take their point of departure from the position of a plumb-line or level , it is a general method to measure these two arcs separately ; that is to say , the zenith distance of the sun is considered as the immediate object of investigation , and the remaining arc , or as it is usually termed , the co-latitude of the place , ( the knowledge of which is presumed ) is added to complete the polar distance .
But in whatever way we consider the subject , it is evident that the sole object of the practical astronomer is to obtain by some mechanical means the measure of this total arc .
The mural circle at Greenwich has neither level nor plumbline , nor do I conceive that the least advanrtage could be derived from the application of either : its principle enables the observer to determine this total arc without any intermediate or zenith point , hence the co-latitude , the knowledge of which is so essential from the construction of other instruments , is in this case rather a question of curiosity than of absolute necessity .
I find it , however , convenient ( for reasons which I hope to have an opportunity of stating more at large in a future Paper ) to assume an intermediate point , which I call the zenith point , without being at all anxious to know whether it is really so or not ; because I find myself poss &amp; ssed of the means of determining the position of this imaginary point of departure , on the instrument , to within the tenth of a second , a degree of precision , which I apprehend no level or plumb-line can ever be expected to equal .
From this point of departure , I measure the distance of the sun to the southward , and of the pole to the northward , and the sum of these two measures is evidently the north polar distance of the sun , which in every method is the ultimate object to be attained .
I have , as an example , annexed a computation of the same s8 solstice obtained by direct measurement , from the pole , without the aid of the intermediate point above mentioned ; and it will be seen that the results do not in this case differ above a quarter of a second from each other .
There is indeed no other difference between these two methods but that , in the former case , the part of the arc ZP is obtained rather more accurately , by a great number of observations both before and after the solstice , than could be done in the short interval of time in which the solstice itself is observed .
By sixty observations of y draconis , of w'lich only three differ so much as i " from the mean , it appears that the zenith point which I have assumed is 2 ' , 18",64 , south of the mean position of draconis for the beginning of the year 1812 , which is the same quantity that is found by the observations with the zenith sector , 1811 .
Mr. TROUGH'TON is now Occupied in making a zenith sector upon a new and very simple principle , with which I have no doubt that this distance may be determined with a much greater degree of precision .
Astronomers will immediately perceive that this arc , however accurately it may be mechanically determined , must inevitably be subject to whatever uncertainty still exists upon the question of astronomical refractions ; the instrument not having been erected long enough to remove this uncertainty , I have for the present employed Dr. BRADLEY 's refractions , : such as they have been used for many years in this Observatory .
Such alterations in this part of the calculation may .
easily be made in future , as the advanced state of the science may require .
