On the Tides .
By J. W. LUBBOCK , Esq. V. P. and Treas .
R.S. Received December 16 , 1833 , -Read February 20 , 1834 .
I HAVE already presented to the Society some tables exhibiting results obtained by the discussion of many observations of the tides made at the London Docks .
I have now to communicate other tables , also calculated , according to my instructions , by Mr. DEssIOU .
In those already published in the Philosophical Transactions , which have reference to the corrections due to the influence of the parallax and declination of the moon , Mr. DEssIOU employed only observations of the tides made between conjunction and opposition ; but considering it of importance to establish these corrections upon a greater number of observations , and also to ascertain whether any appreciable difference existed , Mr. DEssIOU undertook to obtain similar corrections from observations made between opposition and conjunction .
The difference , if there be any , is very small .
It formerly escaped my notice , that the correction due to the influence of the moon 's declination is mixed up with that for the calendar mnonths : but the inclination of the moon 's orbit to the ecliptic is small ; and when observations are considered throughout an entire revolution of her node , she may be taken to move in the ecliptic ; so that her time of transit being given on any day of the year , her declination is also given .
This suggestion was made to me by Mr. WHEWELL , and I have endeavoured to remedy this difficulty , and have now calculated the correction for the calendar months roughly , which may serve until there has been time to obtain it with greater precision .
My corrections for the influence of the moon 's parallax and declination may , I think , be safely adopted ; and I doubt if they be susceptible of much further improvement .
Their discrepancy from the theory of BERNOULLI is worthy of remark , as may be seen in the following Table , which gives BERNOULLI'S correction for the influence of the moon 's parallax , and that which Mr. DEssIOU has calculated .

The theory of the tides is now , as Mr. WHEWELL remarks , in the state which that of the motions of the moon and planets presented about a century ago ; and unless considerable exertions be made , it may so continue for many years to come .
The tables of the planets have only acquired their present accuracy through the liberal encouragement of learned bodies , and of some of the governments of Europe ; nor can tables of the tides , adapted to the present state of science , be now constructed , unless a very considerable expense be incurred , from the immense labour required .
In discussing tide observations , when the greatest possible accuracy is desired , and when the correctness of the observations appears to warrant such a nicety , in order to obtain any particular correction , all known approximate corrections of a different nature should first be separately applied to each observation with a contrary sign .
So , in the determination of the correction for the calendar months , it would be well to correct all the observations first for parallax and declination ; and this consideration should be particularly attended to , where it is practicable , in attempting to determine , from a few observations , the establishment of any port and the semimenstrual inequality .
The best method of verifying my tables would be to determine by their means the times andeights of high water at the Londo Docks for nineteen years , and then to classify the transits of the moon with the errors of those determinations , according to calendar months , and according to parallaxes and declinations : the average error corresponding to each calendar month would be the error of the Table* for the calendar months , and so for the rest .
Mr. W. PIERCE , of the London Docks , under whose care the observations have been made , has kindly communicated to me the following information .
The observations were originally instituted at the instigation of Mr. W. VAUGHAN , of Fenchurch-street , then one of the directors , in consequence of having seen an account of the tides kept at Liverpool .
The time was always taken by Wapping church clock , which is considered in Wapping as good a timekeeper as any in London .
The observations , previously to the opening of the Docks , viz. from 1801 to January 1805 , were taken by Mr. PIERCE in the day , and by a foreman in the night .
After the Docks opened , from 1805 to 1828 , inclusive , they were taken by the watchman in the day , and by Mr. PIERCE and two foremen , who attended alternately , four teen nights each .
From 1823 up to the present time they are taken in the day by the foreman at the entrance lock , in the night by two foremen alternately .
The time has , at my instigation , been more particularly attended to since I had the accounts ( 1829 ) , when Mr. PIERCE gave the foreman charge to be particularly careful .
The heights , previously to the opening of the Docks ( viz. 1801 to 1805 ) , were taken by the averaged eighteen-feet tide at the Trinity marks , or , as it is called , Trinity datum .
The marks were fixed in a wall where the entrance now is .
The lock being made five feet deeper than Trinity datum , there are twenty-three feet at the lock when the water is at the eighteen-feet mark Trinity datum ; therefore the difference between the lines from which the heights are reckoned in the books containing the observations is five feet ; so that eighteen feet previously to 1805 is the same height or depth as twentythree feet after that time .
In similar accounts of tide observations , the initials or the name at full length of the observer should be affixed to each observation , in orider to afford a check upon the care with which they are made .
Sir JOHN HALL has kindly favoured me with the following information relative to the influence of the wind upon the tides in the port of London .
Sir JOHN HIALL procured the joint opinion of some nautical men , including the dock-master of the St. Katharine Docks , and the senior harbour-master of the port .
The following is the result of their sentiments respecting the influence of the wind upon the tides in the river Thames .
During strong north-westerly gales , the tide marks high water earlier than otherwise , and does not give so much water , whilst the ebb-tide runs out later , and marks lower ; but upon the gales abating , and the weather moderating , the tides put in , and rise much higher , whilst they also run longer before high water is marked , and with more velocity of current , nor do they run out so long or so low .
The reason assigned for all this is , that the strong north-west winds drive the sea along the Dutch coast , through the straits of Dover , and consequently away from the mouth of the Thames ; so that the tides , during north-west winds , are always much higher ( producing frequently ruinous flooding , ) on the Dutch than upon the English coast .
A southwesterly gale has a contrary effect generally , and an easterly one gives some water ; but the tides , in all these cases , always improve the moment the weather moderates .
MIDCCCXXXIV .
u 145 This is the opinion of those most competent to form one , from their daily experience , and is no doubt correct .
The subject is one of considerable importance , as regards the accuracy of which tide predictions are susceptible , and merits further inquiry , in order to ascertain , if possible , the error which nay be expected for a wind of given force and direction .
In order to obtain the correction for the calendar months , I begin by forming the following Table , which gives the moon 's declination roughly , but sufficiently near for my purpose , in different months of the year , supposing her to move in the ecliptic .

They might perhaps be amended in a subsequent revision , by applying these corrections , considered as approximate , to each of the observations employed , with a contrary sign , so as to obtain a discussion of their errors .
I am confident , however , that they are not susceptible of any material improvement ; and that we may proceed safely to investigate the laws or expressions which they represent .
It will also be desirable to ascertain , by a discussion of their errors , when used in predicting the phenomena , whether the fluctuations of the atmosphere , as indicated by the barometer , have any sensible effect , as is the case , according to M. DAUSSY , on the coast of France , and also to discover the extent to which the phenomena.are modified by winds and storms .
The Tables might be rendered more convenient for practice by the addition of a constant , so as to render all the corrections positive , but I have retained them in their present state in order that the law of the inequalities may be more apparent .
This change can easily be made if required , but by such a process the intrinsic character of the Tables is not altered .
In the Philosophical Transactions for 1833 I gave the semimenstrual inequality , including of course the establishment for Breast , Plymouth , Portsmouth , and Sheerness .
M. DEssiOU has since deduced the following Tables for Pembroke Dockyard , Liverpool , Howth , and Ramsgate .
