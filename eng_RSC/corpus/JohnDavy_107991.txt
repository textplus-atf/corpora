Notice of the remains of the recent Volcano in the Mediterranean .

IN consequence of an examination made by Captain SWINBURNE , R.N. , of the shoal formed by the subsidence of the volcanic island which was thrown up in the summer of last year , I am enabled to give a few more particulars respecting it , which I beg leave to communicate to the Royal Society , not so much on account of the importance of the particulars themselves , as for the sake of endeavouring to contribute as much as possible towards the history of the volcano .
I shall insert an extract from a letter of Captain SWINBURNE , containing the results of his examination , dated the 24th of August , addressed by him to the admiral on the station , and which was published in the Malta Gazette of the same date .
" It " ( the volcano ) " has left a dangerous shoal , consisting principally of black sand and stones , with a circular patch of rock in the middle of it , about forty-two yards in diameter , on which there are two fathoms water generally , but in one spot only nine feet .
All round the rock there are from two and a half to three fathoms , deepening gradually to five and six fathoms at the average distance of one hundrled yards from the centre , then more rapidly to ten , twenty , thirty , forty , &amp;c. fathoms .
" A small detached rock with fifteen feet on it lies one hundred and thirty yards to the S.W. of the central patch .
About three quarters of a mile N.W. of the centre there is a detached bank with twenty-three fathoms on it .
All the rock appears to be dark-coloured porous lava , and the sand ( which is extreinely fine in the deepest water , ) is composed entirely of particles of the same substance .
By this the soundings near the shoal may be distinguished ; but it should be approached with great caution , as a large extent of discoloured but deep water which lies to the S.W. may be mistaken for it , while the real danger is seldom visible till it is near , being composed of very dark-coloured materials , and it is so deep that the lead cannot be trusted .
Its latitude and longitude , as far as my limited means of observation enable me to decide , are 37§ 9 ' N. and 12§ 43 ' E. of Greenwich .
" In conversation with Captain SWINBURNE previous to his proceeding to examine the shoal , I mentioned to him as a desideratum , the collecting a portion of any air which might be seen rising from the site of the volcano ; and , on his return into port on the 22nd of August , he obliged me with two specimens which he had procured .
They were contained in wine-bottles , which were corked and inverted in water .
Each bottle was about half-full of air .
According to Captain SWINBURNE'S statement , the air was collected and preserved with all possible care , so as to preclude the possibility of any admixture of external atmospheric air .
In a letter with which this gentleman has favoured me on the subject , after describing how the air was collected and preserved , he adds : " It came up in many places in small silver threads of bubbles ; the quantity varied from time to time in the same place , and where it was most plentiful , the bottom , looking at it through a water-glass , had somewhat the appearance that is observed in chalybeate springs ; the cinders ( elsewhere quite black ) had a rusty appearance .
I could detect no difference in the temperature of the water at these spots , nor any between the water on or near the shoal and that at a distance from it .
" On the 23rd of August , about twelve hours after I had received the bottles of air , I examined them .
On withdrawing the corks under water , in neither bottle was there any diminution of the volume of the air ; -no indication of any absorption having been produced by the salt water with which it had been in contact for several days .
Though collected at some distance from each other , I found both specimens of air very nearly similar .
Neither of them was inflammable , nor had any smell of sulphuretted hydrogen , nor was absolvable by lime water , and both extinguished flame .
Forty-one measures of one , by phosphorus were diminished to 37 , and thirty-five measures of the other were diminished to 31-5 ; indicating the presence of between nine and ten parts of oxygen , mixed with between seventy-nine and eighty of azote .
The origin of this air must necessarily be matter of speculation .
Two views may be taken of it .
It may either be supposed to have arisen from the extinct volcano ; or , to have been disengaged from sea water at the bottom in contact with , and penetrating into the loose and probably hot ashes and cinders coimposing the shoal .
The situation of the volcanic shoal so far from land , and all the circumstances best authenticated relative to the volcano whein in activity , seem very unfavourable to the first supposition .
The second supposition seems more reasonable .
Had the air consisted of oxygen and azote in the same proportions as exist in the atmosphere , it would hardly be a subject for question .
The presence of about as much as ten per cent. oxygen is strong proof that the source of the air was not very deep , not beneath the bed of the sea .
Supposing it disengaged from the water , as alluded to , it is easy to conceive how it might be deprived of its oxygen .
The oxygen of atmospheric air absorbed by sea water probably becomes less and less in quantity with the depthl to which it penetrates , both from the action of living and dead matter swimming and suspended in the water , so that in a very deep sea not a particle of oxygen may reach the bottom .
In addition to which general causes for the abstraction of oxygen , in the instance of this shoal there appears to have been a special one in operation ; viz. the black oxide of iron entering into the composition of the cinders and ashes derived from the volcano .
Now , as Captain SWINBURNE expressly states , that where the air rose , there " the cinders had a rusty appearance , " indicating the conversion of the black oxide into red , it clearly follows that the change must have been owing to an absorption of oxygen ; and it can hardly be doubted that it was derived from the air in question .
I may add , that the minute quantity in which the air was disengaged , is favourable to the second supposition rather than the first .
Rising " in silver threads of bubbles , " as described by Captain SWINBURNE , is what might be expected on the idea of its being disengaged by the water .
Had it been evolved in large volumes , then this source would have been inadequate , and it would have been necessary to have sought for it deeper , in connexion with , or as a product of the volcano .
To obviate a possible objection , I would further beg to add , that the temperature of the water at the surface , where the gas was ascending , being the same as in the adjoining sea , is no proof that at the bottom it was not higher .
What I witnessed in relation to the temperature of the sea close to the volcano when it was in activity , as described in my first communication to the Society , is sufficiently demonstrative of this .
The explanation just proposed of the-origin of a mixture of oxygen and azote in this instance , may probably adinit of wide extension , and may be applicable to all hot springs firomi which azote is disengaged , whether pure , as in a few examples , or mixed with othei gases , as is Inore common .
The water feeding the springs , derived from the atmosphere , on entering the ground , must contain a certain quantity of conmmnon air ; the oxygen of which , from a variety of substances attracting it , Inay be separated and absorbed in the descent and re-ascent of the water through the strata of the earth , wliilst the azote will remain free to be disengaged from elevation of temperature , or removal of pressure when the spring bursts forth at the surface .
