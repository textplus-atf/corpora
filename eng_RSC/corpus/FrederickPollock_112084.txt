( Abstract .
) This paper ( with its Supplement ) proposes a proof of the first two theorems of Fermat , relating to the polygonial numbers , viz. that every numlber is composed of not exceeding three triangular numbers , and not exceeding four square numbers .
And this is done by a method entirely new , founided on the proper ties of the triangular inumbers and the square numl)ers , and the relationi they bear to each other , and on the expansion of an algebraical expression of three members into a line , a square , and a cuibe , so as to obtaini every possible value of the whole expression ; and throughout the proof every number or term in a series ( except in the Table ) is expressed by the roots of the squares that compose it , and the roots only are dealt With , and not the num6ers or the squares that compose them ; a Table is constructed from the trianigular numbers , tiuns ( see opposite page ) .
Mode of constructing the T'able .
The series of triangular numbers is in the centre of the Table .
Below that series the adjoining terms are uniiited , and they form the squarec nuumbers 1 , 4 , 9 , &amp;c. ; the next adjoining terms are uniited , and they form the next row , and so on .
Above the triangular numbe-s eaich term is doubled , forming the series above , and then the adjacent terms are added together and form the next row , and so on ; the dlifferenees above are 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , &amp;c. ( 2n+ 1 ) , and below are 2 , 4 , ( i , 8 , 10 , &amp;c. ( 2n ) .
From the exaynination of which Table it appears that the sum of any two triangular numbers , however remote from each other in the series , is ailways a square number plus a double trialngular number ; that is , a 2+ac 62 ?
+6 22 a2++2+ ec+e+d and the difference between the sunm of two trianguilar numbers and the sum of some other two triangular numbers may be any number whatevcr , odd or even , positive or negative .
The first of these propositions is mentioned and proved algebraically in .
the Philosoplhical Transactions of the year 1861 , p. 412 ; the result is perhaps more clear when presenited in a tabular form as above ( but more extenisively and at large in the paper ) ; it is obviously capable of strict algebraical proof .
These two propositions , and the expansion of an algebraical expression into a line , a square , and a cube ( exhausting every possible value of the expression ) , are the foundation of the whole proof , which , in addition to proving the first and second theorems of Fermat , proves also that every odd number has in some form or other m " .-I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ CC -4 -O '-.4 f.4.4 ci1 c.

If a2 +a +h2 _ ( in2 + m ?
n2 ) be equal to any number whatever , odd or even , it must equal a number represented by p2 _ ( c2 + C ) ; and as a2 + a+ 62_ ( mi2 ?
in + n2 ) _p2 _ ( c2 C ) , .
a2+a+ 2+c2+C=m2+in+ n2 + p2 .
These two expressions are equivalent to each other , and any number which is of the one form is also of the other form ; and if they be doubled and 1 be added to each , they will become 2a2 +2a+ 1+262 +2c2 ? ?
2c , 2nz2 ? ?
2m +I+ 2n2+ 2p2 , and either of them will represent any odd number whatever .
For a2+ a+ b2-(m2 ?
i+ n2 ) not only equals p2 ( C2+ c ) , but it also equals p2 _ ( e2 + c ) + q ; and if both be doubled and 1 be added , 2Mn2+2m+ 1 +2n2+2p2+2q-2a2 ?
2a 1 +262 ?
r2c2+2c ; if therefore to either form any even number ( 2q ) be added , it is still of the form of the other , and therefore still of its own form , that is , 2m2+ 2m +1+ 2n2 + 2p2 + 2q is still of the form 2ni2 + 2m +1+ 2n2 + 2p2 , and that form therefore represents any odd number .
It is showrn in the paper that when 2a2+ 2a + 1 , 262 , 2c2+ 2c is expanded , 2a2+2a+1 becomes a series ( by the addition of 4 , 8 , 12 , &amp;c. ) whose terms will be 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 ; 0 , 0 , 1 , 2 ; 0 , 0 , 2 , 3 , &amp;c. , and may be conisidered as a line whose general expression is 0 , 0 , a , ( a+ 1 ) .
When 2b2 is added to each term by the addition of 2 , 6 , 10 , 14 , &amp;c. it becomes a square whose general term is 6 , b , a , a+ ?
( these being roots whose squares added together form the term in the square ) .
Lastly , when 2c2+ 2c is added ( by decreasing a and increasing a+ 1 , 1 each time ) and the square becomes a cube , every term has two roots equLal , but is composed of not exceeding 4 square numbers ; and as on the addition to any term of arny even number ( 2q ) the term so increased will still be within the cube ( extended indefinitely ) , the cuibe will contain every odd number ; but if 2i2+ 2m ++ 2n2 be formed into a square , and then by the addition of 2p2 be raised into a cube ( the terms n , n in each term being one increased , and the other dimilnished by 1 ) , every term in the cube will have two roots differing by 1 , and will be composed of not exceeding 4 square numbers ; and this cube also will contain every odd number for the same reason that the other will .

Lastly , a2 +a+ 62 ( m2 ?
+ Mi+ n2 ) will ( as it equals arny number ) equal either p2_C2+ c or p2 _-2 + C+ q , and therefore 2a2+ 2a + 1 , + 2b2+ c2 +c 22 will equal 2mn2+2nz +1+ 2n2 + 2p2 with or without 2q .
In raising a , a+ 1 , b , 6 to a cube by adding c2+c , it niust be by the addition of 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , &amp;c. , which must be added alternately to each ; 2 , 6 , 10 , 14 , &amp;c. to 6 , b , and 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , &amp;c. to a , + 1 ; but the effect of this alternate addition of 2 , 6 , 10 , &amp;c. to b , b , by increasing one of them by 1 and diminishing the other , and of 4 , 8 , 12 , &amp;c. to a , a +1 by decreasing each time by I and increasing a+ 1 by 1 , is to make the algebraic sum of the four roots at all times equal to 1 , as is distinctly shown in the paper ; and if 2a2+2a+1+262+ c2+ c will represent any odd number , then 22+2a+1+262+ c2+ c-2n+ 1 , deducting I and dividing by 2 .
a2+ a+ b2+c 2e n , and as a+a+ b2 equals the sum of 2 triangular l2 numbers and(6 +2 is a triangular number ) therefore every number is composed of not exceeding three trian ular numbers .
