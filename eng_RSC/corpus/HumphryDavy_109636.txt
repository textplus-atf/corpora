[ Phil. Trans. 1807 , p. 1 .
] The chemical effects produced by electricity have , Mr. Davy says , long been objects of attention ; but the novelty of the phenomena , their want of analogy to known facts , and the apparent discordance of some of the results , involved the inquiry in obscurity .
It was very early observed , that acid and alkaline matter appeared in water acted upon by a current of electricity ; but Mr. Davy soon found that the muriatic acid came from the animal or vegetable matters employed to connect the two portions of water ; for when the same cotton was repeatedly used , it ceased to be evolved .
The soda , in like manner , was found to proceed from the corrosion of the glass tube , as it did not appear in water electrified in an agate cup .
To be more certain of this effect , some distilled water was electrified in two agate cups , by the current from 150 four-inch plates , the communication between the cups being formed by moistened amianthus .
In the first experiment soda was produced in the negative cup , .
but the quantity was much less than when glass tubes were used ; and on repeating the experiment , its quantity decreased , so that in the fourth experiment the presence of soda was scarcely perceptible in the residual water .
The water in the other tube was sour , and , appeared to contain nitrous acid , with excess of nitrous gas .
As similar effects were produced by electrifying water in small gold cones , Mr. Davy suspected that some minute portion of saline matter had been carried over during the distillation of the water ; notwithstanding it did not affect nitrate of silver , or muriate of barytes .
And on evaporating a quantity of it in a silver vessel by a heat not exceeding 140 ?
Fahrenheit , a small residuum was actually left , which appeared to be a mixture of nitrate of soda with nitrate of lead .
A portion of this residuum being added to water electrified in the usual manner , and which had attained the maximum of its effect upon turmeric paper , considerably increased those effects .
Water slowly distilled , being electrified either in gold cones or agate cups , did not evolve any fixed alkaline matter , though it exhibited signs of ammonia ; but in tubes of wax , both soda and potash were evolved , and the acid matter in the positive cup was a mixture of sulphuric and muriatic acids .
In a tube of resin the alkali was principally potash .
In cups of Carrara marble , primitive marble from Donegal , argillaceous schist from Cornwall , serpentine from theLizard , and grauwacke from North Wales , soda was uniformly evolved .
This probably arose from a minute portion of common salt being contained in them , for the Carrara marble yielded a sensible quantity on analysis ; and on repeating the electrifying of the water in the cup formed of it , the presence of soda became less visible every time , and at length disappeared entirely ; but the production of limewater was uniform .
A bit of glass added to water , which was electrifying in the gold cones , caused it to exhibit almost immediately the presence of soda .
In every instance nitrous acid was uniformly found in the positive cup , which appeared to proceed from the combination of nascent oxygen with the nitrogen of the common air absorbed by the water .
The longer the operation was continued , the more acid was produced , arising from the air which continued to be absorbed .
Volatile alkali was also constantly formed , from the combination of the nascent hydrogen with the nitrogen ; but it soon attained its utmost limit , as hydrogen during its solution in water seems to expel nitrogen .
When water was electrified in vacuo scarcely any nitrous acid , and no volatile alkali , was formed .
When electrified in a receiver filled with hydrogen ( the common air originally contained in the water having been extracted by the air pump ) , neither nitrous acid nor volatile alkali was found in the water .
In all these processes , the acid matter collected in the water round the point transmitting the electricity , and the alkaline matter round that which received it .
When water was even electrified in two cups made of sulphate of lime , it was found that the water connected with the positive wire contained sulphuric acid , while that in the other cup was a pure and saturated solution of lime .
Similar effects were produced when use was made of cups of sulphate of strontian , fluate of lime , or sulphate of barytes .
It also appeared , that very minute portions of acid or alkaline matter might be disengaged by this means from solid combinations , consisting principally of the pure earths .
When cups were used made of a basalt which contained 3-1 parts of soda , and nearly half a part of muriatic acid , with fifteen parts of lime in the 100 , oxymuriatic acid was found in the positive cup , and a mixture of lime and soda in the other .
A cup of compact zeolite , containing seven per cent. of soda , yielded soda and lime to the water connected with the negative wire .
Lepidolite yielded potash , and vitreous lava from Etna yielded a mixture of soda , potash , and lime .
Mr. Davy attempted to ascertain whether the weight of the alkali obtained , agreed with the weight lost by the substance operated upon .
Water was electrified negatively for four days , by a current from 150 plates , in a glass tube that weighed 84 , -i6Tgrains .
The positive wire was inlserted into water , contained in an agate cup , and the communication was kept up by moistened amianthus .
At the end of the process the glass tube weighed 84 3grains .
The water being evaporated , yielded -r7- ?
grains of a mixture of soda , with a white powder insoluble in acids .
When soluble compounds were put into water , contained in agate cups , and electrified , the decomposition was more rapid .
A solution of sulphate of potash being put into each of the cups , and electrified by means of fifty pair of plates for four hours , the acid was found by itself in the positive cup , and the alkaline bases in the negative cup .
Similar phenomena took place with sulphate of soda , nitrate of potash , nitrate of barytes , sulphate of ammonia , and alum .
When muriatic salts were used , these yielded oxymuriatic acid .
When compatible mixtures of neutro-saline compounds were used , the different acids and bases separated in a mixed state , without any regard to their affinities .
When solutions of metals , deoxidizable by nascent hydrogen were employed , metallic crystals formed on the negative wire , and some oxide was deposited ; but solutions of iron , zinc , and tin , only deposited oxide ; a great excess of acid was soon observed on the positive side .
Although stronger solutions afforded signs of decomposition quicker than weaker ones , yet even the smallest proportions seemed to be acted upon with equal energy : as paper tinged with turmeric was immediately rendered brown when plunged into pure water and brought into contact with the negative point ; so paper tinged with litmus was immediately reddened by the positive point , in consequence of the very minute portion of saline matter contained in the paper ; and it further appeared , that in all these decompositions the separation of the constituent parts from the last portions of the compounds was complete when the operation was sufficiently protracted .
The contact of the solution with the wires was not necessary for its decomposition ; for muriate of potash being put into the middle tube of a series of three , the outer ones containing only water and the wires , alkali soon appeared in that connected with the negative wire , and acid in the other ; and at length they were obtained perfectly separate .
In thus causing the acids to be thus transferred from a saline compound into water , through moistened amianthus , no change was observed to take place in litmus paper placed near the amianthus .
The reddening of the litmus paper always , took place just above the positive point , and then slowly diffused itself to the middle of the vessel .
Similar effects were observed when the alkali was transferred , the turmeric paper first becoming brown close to the negative wire .
When three glass tubes were used , the two outer tubes holding a solution of muriate of soda , and the middle one sulphate of silver , a communication being made with the central vessel by turmeric paper on the positive side , and by litmus paper on the negative , neither of the papers had its colour changed , although the muriatic acid passing through the amianthus occasioned a dense heavy precipitate in the sulphate of silver , and the soda a more diffuse and lighter one .
Acid or alkaline substances will also pass through liquids , having a strong attraction for them .
In an apparatus of three tubes , Mr. Davy found that sulphuric acid , evolved from sulphate of potash , would pass into water , through either ammonia , lime-water , or weak solutions of potash or of soda .
The only effect of strong solutions of potash or.soda was to increase the time necessary for this transfer .
Muriatic or nitric acids were also transmitted through alkaline solutions ; and , vice versed , alkaline matter , by changing the arrangement of the liquids , was transmissible through the acids : even magnesia was transferred like the other bases .
But when it was attempted to pass sulphuric acid through aqueous solutions of barytes or of strontian , on the contrary , the sulphate of those earths .
was deposited in the intermediate tube. .
Muriate of barytes being positive , sulphate of potash intermediate , and .
water negative , potash appeared in the water , and sulphate of barytes was deposited in the intermediate vessel .
Muriate of barytes being negative , sulphate of silver intermediate , and water positive , -sulphuric acid only appeared in the water , and mnuriate of silver was.deposited in the intermediate vessel .
Mr. Davy then proceeds to develop the theory of these phenomena : and he first considers the mode of decomposition and transition .
Hydrogen , alkaline substances , and metallic oxides , are attracted by negatively electrified metallic substances , and repelled by positive ones : contrary effects take place with oxygen and the acids .
He thinks these electric energies are communicated from one particle to another of the same kind , so as to establish a conducting chain in the fluid , as acid matter is always found in the alkaline solutions through which it is transferred , as long as any acid matter remains at the original source .
It is possible that there may be , in some cases , a succession of decompositions and recompositions ; but the process is not absolutely necessary , as pure acids and alkalies pass through waterto the points by which they .
are attracted .
It appears that this power of transference is overcome by gravity in attempting to pass barytes through sulphuric acid , or muriatic acid through sulphate of silver .
To these instances he adds , that magnesia and the metallic.oxides will not pass through an intermediate vessel of water , but sink to the , bottom .
In the decomposition of water , a particle of oxygen is attracted by the positive point , and at the same time a particle of hydrogen is repelled by it ; the opposite process takes place at the negative point : and , in the.middle of the circuit there must be a new combination of the repelled matter , in the same manner as when two portions of muriate ofsoda are separated by water ; muriatic is repelled from the-negative side , and soda from the positive side ; so that muriate of soda is composed in the middle vessel .
Although similar effects could not be produced by silently passing a strong current of electricity from an electrical machine for four hours , through sulphate of potash , yet they were produced by using platina wires *1th of an inch in diameter , cemented in glass tubes ; so that no doubt can arise but that the principle of action is the same in common as in voltaic electricity .
It was known that many bodies brought into contact and then separated , exhibited opposite states of electricity ; and Mr. Davy himself had observed , that when acid and alkaline solutions were employed in alternation with plates of a single metal , the alkaline solution received the electricity from the metal , and the acid transmitted it to the metal .
So in the simplest case of electrical action , the alkali , receiving electricity from the metal , would , on being separated from it , appear positive , and of course be repelled by positively electrified surfaces , and attracted by negatively electrified surfaces ; the acid , acquiring the .
contrary electricity , following the contrary order .
Several phenomena accord with this idea .
Sulphur separated from its contact with a metal is positive ; and , in like manner , sulphur separated from sulphuric acid by electricity is attracted by the negative surface .
And again , hydrogenated sulphuretted alkalies , being composed of three substances , all positive , are so very active in voltaic combinations as , in. .
certain cases , to overpower the energies of the metals ... Mr. Davy then considers the relation between the electrical energy of bodies and their chemical affinities ; and observes , that all the substances that combine chemically , exhibit , so far asi is known , opposite electric states- ; and that , in the various experiments of decomposition by electricity , the natural electrical energies of the constituent parts of the compounds acted on are , as.it.were , overpowered by the arti.ficial electricities : so that it is probable that chemical affinity depends upon the different electrical energies of the acting bodies .
And upon this supposition , particles possessed of opposite electrical states and freedom of motion will enter into combination .
When two bodies possessed of the same state act upon a third body possessed of the opposite state , the substance possessing the weakest energy will be repelled .
In other cases there may be such a balance of attractive and repellent powers as to produce triple compounds , or even more complicated combinations .
It will also be easy to explain the influence of the masses of bodies upon their affinities ; :for the , combined effect of many particles possessing a feeble electrical energy may be conceived equal , or even superior , to the effect of a few particles possessing a strong electrical energy ; and , accordingly , we find that concentrated alkalies resist the , transmission of acids more powerfully than weak ones. .
As the strength of the electricity diminishes from the points to the middle of the water , a measure of the artificial energies may be obtained by the place where the compounds begin to be decomposed .
Thus sulphate of barytes requires intermediate contact with the wires .
; and when 150 pieces of plates were used with a circuit of water of ten inches , sulphate of potash was not decomposed at four inches from the positive wire ; but when brought within two inches , its alkali was strongly repelled .
As heat and light are the consequences of a restoration of the equilibrium between bodies in a high state of opposite electricities , so are they also the result of all intense chemical action ; and again , as when large quantities of electricity of low intensity act , heat is produced without light , so in low combinations the temperature only is increased .
The effect of heat in promoting chemical action seems not confined to the freedom of motion it gives to the particles , but to the exaltation of the electrical energies of bodies , such as is well known to take place in glass , tourmalin , and sulphur .
The electricity of an insulated plate of copper , and a plate of sulphur , was scarcely sensible at 560 Fahr. to the condensing electrometer ; at 100 ?
they affected the gold leaves without condensation ; they increased in a still higher ratio as the sulphur approached its melting point ; and at a little above that point , the two substances rapidly combine , and evolve heat and light .
In general , when the different electrical energies are equally strong , the combination seems to be vivid , the heat and light intense , and the new compound is in a neutral state , as in combustion , and the union of the strong acids with the alkalies ; but when only the energy is strong , the effect is less vivid , and the compound exhibits the excess of the stronger energy .
Mr. Davy then considers the theory of the Voltaic apparatus ; and remarks , that the above facts seem to reconcile Volta 's own theory with the chemical theory of galvanism .
In a pile of zinc , copper , and water , the plates are in opposite states of electricity ; and in regard to such low electricity , the water is an insulating body .
Of course , each plate produces an opposite electricity upon the opposite plate , the intensity increasing with the number , and the quantity with the extent of the series .
" Upon connecting the extreme points , the opposite electricities tend to produce an equilibrium , which would cause the motion to cease : but the fluid medium being composed of two elements possessing opposite electrical energies , the oxygen is attracted by the zinc , and the hydrogen by the copper .
Hence the balance of power is only momentary ; for oxide of zinc is formed , and hydrogen is disengaged .
The electricity acquired by the copper is communicated anew to the zinc , and the process continues as long as the chemical changes are carried on .
Neither the conducting nor solvent powers of the fluid mediums are a principal cause of their activity ; for strong sulphuric acid has very little activity in the pile .
The effect of neutro-saline solutions diminishes when troughs are used , according as their acid arranges itself on the side of the zinc plates , and their alkali on the other ; but the energy may be restored by agitating the fluids in the cells .
As sensible heat appears when an equilibrium is produced by small metallic surfaces in the voltaic battery , the opposite states being exalted , so if the decomposition of the chemical agents be essential to the balance of the opposed electricities , the decomposition of the saline solutions ought to be attended with an increase of temperature .
To water electrified in the gold cones by the power of 100 plates , a drop of solution of potash was added in the positive cone : potash immediately passed over , and in less than two minutes the water was in a state of ebullition .
When solution of nitrate of ammonia was employed , the water was evaporated in three or four minutes with a kind of explosive noise , and inflammation took place .
The pure alkalies , or acids , produced very little effect , although they are better conductors .
Lastly , some general applications of these singular facts are pointed out by Mr. Davy ; such , for instance , as the application of electricity to the analysis of animal and vegetable substances .
Muscular fibre being electrified for some time , became dry and hard ; and it left , upon incineration , no saline matter .
Potash , soda , ammonia , lime , and oxide of iron , were collected on the negative side ; and the sulphuric , nitric , muriatic , phosphoric , and acetous acids , on the positive .
Laurel-leaf was rendered brown and parched ; green colouring matter , with resin , alkali , and lime , appeared in the negative vessel , and prussic acid in the positive .
By using charcoal and plumbago , or charcoal and iron , as the exciting powers , along with neutro-saline solutions , large quantities of acids and alkalies might be procured with little trouble or expense .
It is very probable that many mineral formations have been materially influenced or even occasioned by the agency of the electricity ; and the electrical power of transference may thus be applied to the explanation of the principal points in geology .
