On the Affectzons f Light transmitted through crystallized Bodies .
By David Brewster , LL. D. F. R. S. Edin .
and F. S. A. Edin .
In a Letter to Sir Humphry Davy , LL. D. F.R. S. Read December 23 , 1813 .
DEAR SIR , IN a former paper* on " Some Properties of Light , " which I took the liberty of addressing to you , and which the Royal Society honoured with a place in their Transactions , I attempted to give a brief abstract of a set of experiments on the Properties of transparent Bodies in refracting , dispersing , and polarising the rays of Light .
An account of the instruments and methods employed in these experiments has since that time been published in my " Treatise on new philosophical Instruments"* From the general object of these researches , however , I have been allured into a new field of inquiry , by the discovery of a singular property of light transmitted through the agate , and the prosecution of the views which it suggested has led to some very extraordinary results , which , while they seem to conduct us into the very mysteries of physical optics , exhibit at the same time a series of appearances which far surpass , both in splendour and variety , all the phenomena of light under its usual transformations .
In again soliciting you to communicate these observations to the Royal Society , I trust I need offer no apology .
They are closely allied with that science which you have so widely extended by the most profound and brilliant d Phil. Trans. for the year 1813 , p. ioi .
discoveries ; and it is probably from the cultivation of this department of physics , that philosophy will be enabled to unfold the secrets of double refraction , to explain the forms and structure of crystallized bodies , and to develope the nature and properties of that ethereal matter , which , while it enlivens all nature by its presence , performs also a capital part in the operations of the material world .
The different subjects of which I mean to treat in the following letter may be included under five heads .
I. On the polarising power of the agate .
II .
On the structure of the agate as connected with its optical properties .
III .
On the peculiar colours exhibited by the agate .
IV .
On the depolarisation of light .
V. On the elliptical coloured rings produced by obliquely depolarising crystals .
I. On the polarising Power of the Agate .
I have already shown , in a former paper , that a ray of light transmitted through a plate of agate cut by planes perpendicular to the laminae of which it is composed , suffers polarisation like one of the pencils formed by double refraction .
If the light thus polarised is incident at a particular angle upon any transparent body , so that the plane of reflection is perpendicular to the lamine of the agate , it will experience a total refraction ; if it is transmitted through another plate of agate , having its laminae at right angles to those of the plate by which the light is polarised , it will suffer total reflection ; and if it is examined by a prism of Iceland crystal turned round in the hand of the observer , it will vanish and reappear in every quadrant of its circular motion .
188 The pencil of rays to which this remarkable property is communicated is surrounded by a large mass of nebulous light , which extends about 7 30o ' in length , and 1ยง 7 ' in breadth on each side of the bright image.* This nebulous light never vanished with the bright image which it enclosed , but was obviously affected with its different changes , increasing in magnitude as the bright image diminished , and diminishing as the bright image regained its lustre .
From this circumstance I was led to conjecture &lt; that the structure of the agate was in " a state of approach to that particular kind of crystallisation " which affords double images , and that the nebulous light was " an imperfect image arising from that imperfection of struc"ture .
" On the supposition that this conjecture was well founded , I imagined , in conformity with the general analogy o3f all doubly refracting crystals , that the bright image and the nebulous light were produced by two different refractive powers , and I expected to separate the one from the other by forming the agate into a prism with a considerable refracting angle .
Every attempt of this kind , however , was fruitless : no perceptible separation of the images was effected by any of the prisms which I employed , and I was therefore obliged to abandon this mode of investigation .
Having procured a plate of agate remarkably thin and transparent , I admitted a beam of light from the sky into a dark room through a narrow recta , ngular aperture .
When this aperture was viewed through the agate , it was surrounded with a very considerable nebulosity ; and by interposing a prism of Iceland spar between the agate and the eye , and giving it a motion of rotation , the nebulous light became very dense when the bright image vanished , and almndst completely disappeared when the bright image had reached its greatest brilliancy .
The bright and the nebulous images , therefore , comported themselves exactly like the two images formed by doubly refracting crystals ; and the small portion of nebulous light , which surrounded the bright image at its maximum lustre , was obviously produced either by the imperfect polish of the agate , or by its not being cut exactly at right angles to the plane of its laminae .
It will be seen from a subsequent section of this letter , that light polarised by the agate , or by any other means , is depolarised , or partly restored to its original state , by being transmitted in a particular direction through a plate of mica , or any other crystallized body .
I therefore interposed a plate of mica between the agate and the Iceland spar when the nebulous light had nearly disappeared , and having adjusted it to the depolarising position , the nebulous light was instantly revived round the bright image , while the other bright image which had disappeared resumed its place in the middle of the other nebulous mass .
When a pencil of light polarised and afterwards depolarised , in a manner to be afterwards described , is transmitted through a plate of agate , the red* rays go to the formation of the bright image , while the green rays compose the nebulous light , so that we have a red bright image enveloped in a cloud ofgree : light .
By turning round the agate 9go the bright image is formed by the green rays , while the nebulous image consist:s of the red rays , so that we have a green bright image ercircled by a mass of nebulous red light .
If in the place of the agate we substitute a doubly refracting crystal , it will always be found that the ordinary image is green when the extrao-rdinary one is red , and that they assume these colours alternately during the motion of the prism round the axis of vision .
From these experiments , we may consider it as demonstrated , that the nebulous light has the same relation to the bright image , as the first has to the second image of all crystals that have the property of double refraction.* It does not appear , however , that the nebulous image is produced by a greater refractive power than that by which the bright image is formed .
There is on the contrary every reason to conclude , in opposition to the analogy of all doubly refracting t crystals , that the agate gives two images and polarises them like other crystallized bodies , while the one image is placed exactly in the centre of the other .
II .
On the Structure of the Agate as connected with its optical prcperties .
When we examine a piece of transparent and well polished agate , we perceive a number of bands or stripss , which are the sections of a succession of laminz that are sometimes parallel , but in general concentric .
These lamina are often of a milky white colour when seen by reflected light , and sometimes nearly as transparent and colourless as glass , and the white laminae commonly alternate with the transparent ones .
The laminae which are white when seen by reflected light , are brown by transmitted light , and the intensity of this brown colour increases with the thickness of the plate of agate .
The transparent laminae exhibit three varieties of structure .
Thefirst variety , which appears to be the coarsest , consists of a number of small serpentine lines like the figures 333333 , lying parallel to each other , and closely resembling the surface of standing water when ruffled by a gentle breeze , or the sandy bottom of a slow moving stream .
These serpentine lines are always arranged in a direction parallel to the laminae , and are seen very distinctly even when the agate is so thin as the i5oth part of an inch .
The second variety of structure differs from the first , only in the serpentine lines having a much smaller size ; and the laminae which have this structure appear the finest and most transparent .
The third variety has no serpentine lines , and does not appear to differ from other semi-transparent bodies .
It admits the light more copiously in all directions than any of the other structures , and as it does not polarise it in a similar manner , we may consider it as possessing , in a different way , that kind of crystallisation which polarises the incident light by separating it into two pencils .
The white veins sometimes exhibit the first variety of structure , but in several specimens the veins appear to be fibrous 192 in their structure , the fibres stretching at right angles to the laminas through the whole of their thickness .
These different structures will be better understood from fig. 1 and 2 of Plate V. Fig. i , represents the specimen of agate with incurvated veins which I have noticed in a former paper.* It is composed of two veins , AB , CD , and three transparent portions AEB , ABDC , and CFD .
The transparent portions exhibit the second variety of structure , though the small serpentine lines are not so distinctly marked as in other specimens .
The two veins AB , CD , are both white when seen by reflected light .
The breadth of AB is one-tenth of an inch and its radius of curvature ij inch , and it consists offour smaller veins mn , opq , qr zvx .
The light reflected by mn is a paler white , and the light transmitted by it a lighter brown than in the other parts of the vein .
The light which op reflects is of a brighter white , and that which it transmits of a deeper brown than in the other parts of the vein , and at the junction of mn and op there are several tufts of fibres of the same character as op .
The other divisions of .
the vein qr and wx are of an intermediate character between mn and op .
The vein CD resembles the division mn , and possesses , like AB , the fibrous structure already described .
The thickness of the plate AEDC is one-fiftieth part of an inch ; AC is three-tenths of an inch ; and a line AC forms an angle of about 25 ?
with a plane perpendicular to the lamine .
Figure 2 , represents another specimen of agate of a different character .
It consists of transparent portions AB , BC , CD , DE , OF , separated from each other by white veins Bb , Cc , &amp;c. and distinctly exhibiting the second variety of structure ; and of other transparent portions FG , GH , HI , IK , KL , separated by similar veins Gg , Hh , &amp;c. but exhibiting thefirst variety of structure .
All the veins possess a structure approaching to that of the first variety , Gg , Kk exceeding the rest in the intensity of the light which they reflect and transmit .
If we measure the quantity of light transmitted through a plate of agate containing veins , it will be found to be a maximum when the direction of the incident rays is parallel to the interior surfaces of the veins .
When the light , however , is transmitted through a part of the agate of an uniform transparency , and perfectly free from veins , the same result will be obtained , the intensity of the light being a maximum when its direction is parallel to that of the laminae .
If AB , fig. 3 , be a section of the specimen of agate represented in fig. l , and mzn , op , the direction of the lamine inclined 25 ?
to the surfaces of the plate , rays of light incident in the direction RS parallel to mn are more copiously transmitted than when they are incident in any other direction .
When the pencil of light falls in the direction TV , its lustre suffers a great diminution : the light gradually assumes a red colour , and vanishes altogether when the obliquity is considerable .
But if the pencil is incident at the same angle on the opposite side , as PQ , its lustre suffers very little diminution , and its colour is not sensibly altered .
These facts admit , to a certain extent , of an easy explanation if we suppose that ihe plate of agate consists of laminae m ?
, op imperfectly transparent , alternating with laminae cd of which are more pervious to light , a structure which is indicated by the existence of a bright and a nebulous image .
In this case the intensity of the light will obviously be a maximum 19-4 when the ray RS is parallel to mn , and a ray PQ will , within certain limits , suffer less diminution of lustre than a ray TV falling with the same angle of incidence on the other side of RS .
When RS and mn are perpendicular to the surfaces of AB , and when PQ and TV form equal angles with the perpendicular RS , their intensity should be equal ; but this is by no means the case , for the transmitted light which is incident on the side T of RS appears to have a different character from that which is incident on the other side .
We must therefore suppose that there is some other peculiarity of structure in the agate , connected probably with that particular kind of crystallisation which polarises light , toi which this curious fact must be ascribed.* The intensity of the light transmitted by the agate is likewise affected by its polarising property .
If a ray Rr , Plate V. , fig. 4 , is incident upon a piece of agate AB , so as to be polarised by reflection from the second surface , then , since it is polarised during its passage from r to E , the bright image will suffer total reflection at E , while the nebulous image will be transmitted like common light in the direction EG .
If the agate is now turned round 90g the nebulous image will suffer total reflection at E , while the bright image will penetrate the second surface at E like common light .
When the incident ray Rr has different obliquities and the agate intermediate positions , the intensity of the transmitted light will be more or less affected by its polarising power .
The preceding observations on the laminated structure of the agate enable us to give a satisfactory explanation of so m singular appearances exhibited by that mineral .
In the specimen shown in Plate V. , fig. 5 , the black lines represent the veins , and consequently the direction of the lamina , and the dotted lines ab , ac , cm , ck , &amp;c. are drawn through the vertices of the angles made by the veins ; and consequently by the laminae whenever they change their direction .
When light is transmitted through a piece of agate of this description , the planes Aacm , mck , ngf , nhg have the appearance of being differently inclined to one another , and transmit different quantities of light .
If the veins and the laminae preserved the same inclination to the surface of the plate of agate when they changed their direction at the lines ac , cm , de , the phenomenon which has been mentioned could not take place ; but whenever the laminae change their direction , their inclination to the surface likewise changes , and therefore the intensity of the transmitted light experiences a corresponding variation as the rays have to traverse different lengths of the imperfectly transparent laminae .
When the veins and the laminae are incurvated like those in the portion Aacm , their inclination likewise changes , but as this change is gradual and not sudden , as in the former case , the intensity of the transmitted light suffirs agradual variation , and the portion Aacm has the appearance of being concave .
When the laminae therefore are arranged in a circular form , they will resemble a number of dimples , the apparent concavity of which will in some cases depend on the curvature of the laminae , and will exhibit the phenomenon of the ham mered agate .
196 II .
On the peculiar Colours exhibited by the Agate .
In my former letter on the polarising power of the agate , I noticed the existence of a coloured image which appeared on each side of the common colourless image , and which was polarised in a similar manner .
I have since observed the same phenomenon in other specimens , and though I have not been able to discover its cause , I trust the following observations will be of some service to future inquirers .
In the specimen represented , in Plate V. , fig. 2 , the colours appear only when the rays of light are transmitted through the veins B , C , D , E , F , G , H , I , K , or through the coarse grained portions Fg , Gh , Hi , Ik , KkL , and when these parts are covered , no colour is perceived .
If the eye , therefore , is placed behind any of the coarse grained parts , and close to the agate , a colourless image of a candle will be visible , and on each side of it a hlighly coloured image forming an angle of lo ?
with the colourless image .
The colours , which are extremely brilliant , are blue , green , yellow , and red , reckoning from the common image .
A second image coloured in a similar manner , but considerably fainter , is distinctly seen forming with the colourless image an angle of about 21 ? .
When the agate is held some inches distant from the eye , the colours appear diffused over the surface of the coarse grained portions , and when the light is strong , the phenomenon is uncommonly brilliant .
When the vein Bb is a pale blue.at a certain distance from the eye , Cc and Dd are of the same colour , Ee is greenish , Ff is yellowish , Gf is pale red , and the red colour is more intense towards Lk .
By a gentle m(197 tion of the agate the colours of these portions instantly change , a particular colour being always produced in the same portions at a particular angle of incidence .
The veins Gg , Hh , Ii , and Kk are , however , green when the surrounding portions are red , and red when the surrounding portions are green , from which it follows that these veins produce a particular colour at a different angle of incidence from the adjacent portions .
In another specimen of agate , very like the preceding , the same phenomena are distinctly visible , and the coloured image forms the same angle with the common image .
In a third specimen , belonging to ROBERT FERGUSON , Esq. of Raith , the colours are exhibited in the most splendid manner .
A semitransparent and irregularly elliptical zone , about six and a half inches in circumference and three tenths of an inch broad , has thefirst variety of structure , and forms the coloured image at a distance of 13j ?
from the common image .
In the specimen represented in Plate V. , fig. i , the colours are visible only in the vein AB ; but here the angle of the first coloured image with the common image is s8 ?
, while that of the second image , which is very faint , is only a little greater .
The other vein CD , which to all appearance has the same structure as AB , and which differs from it only in being a little thinner , exhibits no colours ; but there is a small stripe st at its edge where the colours are very distinct .
This circumstance induced me to think that the colours depended on the thickness of the plate , as well as upon its structure ; but upon grinding a hollow place mvw in the vein AB , so as to make the agate remarkably thin , I found that it gave the same colours as before .
A similar experiment was made with another piece of agate , and the result 198 was the same , though the thickness of the plate could not exceed the 4ooth part of an inch .
The colours indeed were rendered more brilliant by the increased transparency of the agate , but in other respects they experienced no change .
In another specimen , of which it is unnecessary to give a particular description , the coloured image formed an angle of about 34 ?
with the colourless pencil , and the different veins produced the same colour at different angles of incidence .
In attempting to explain these appearances , I at first imagined that the colours arose from the polarisation of the transmitted rays , and that they were analogous to the colours of plates of mica and topaz which I have described in another place .
I found , however , from several experiments , that the coloured image is equally distinct in every position of the agate ; that it is alike produced by polarised or depolarised light , and that it suffers no change either when examined by a plate of agate or by a doubly refracting crystal .
The phenomenon which we have described must therefore be considered as a new case of the production of colour , and though we do not pretend to point out its cause , yet it obviously depends upon a particular structure which is possessed only by some portions of the agate , and admits of such variations as to produce the same colours at different angles of incidence .
IV .
On the depolarisation of Light .
In the fourth book of my Treatise on new Philosophical Instruments , I have already shown that almost all transparent 199 crystals possess in two positions the singular faculty of depolarising light , or of depriving it of the property which it acquires by transmission through the agate , while in other two positions of the depolarising crystal , the polarity of the light suffers no change .
Thus in Plate V. , fig 5 , let ABDC , be a piece of mica or of any other crystallized body interposed between a plate of agate and a prism of Iceland spar when one of the images has vanished , and let GH be parallel or perpendicular to the laminae of the agate when the vanished image continues invisible .
This line I have called the neutral axis , as no effect is here produced upon the polarised light .
By turning the mica round , the vanished image will gradually appears and when the line AD comes into a vertical position , it will be restored to its full lustre , and will never again vanish whatever be the position of the Iceland spar .
The line AD I have therefore called the depolarising axis , as the light in passing through it has been deprived of the polarity communicated by the agate , and which prevented it from penetrating the rhomboid of Iceland spar .
By continuing the motion of the mica , it will be found that OF is also a neutral axis , and BC a depolarising axis .
The depolarising axes are common to almost all crystallized substances , and what is very singular , I have discovered them in horn , gum Arabic , glue , tortoise-shell , caoutchouc , gold beater 's skin , amber , mother of pearl , camphor , spermaceti melted and cooled , bees ' wax melted and cooled , adipocire melted and cooled , manna , oil of mace , acetate of lead melted and cooled , human hair , bristles of a sow , human cornea , cornea of a fish , cornea of a cow , and imperfectly in some pieces of plate glass .
too Plates of mica , however , while they possess the properties of all depolarising crystals , exhibit phenomena peculiar to themselves .
If the neutral axis GH of a plate of mica is inclined forwards so as to make a considerable angle with the horizon , the image that was formerly invisible will start into existence , and therefore the neutral axis GIH is accompanied with an oblique depolarising axis Nn .
This oblique axis is also possessed by topaz , rock crystal , and many other crystallized bodies .
In making the same experiment with the depolarising axis of the mica , I observed the image to vanish in the direction Mm and Pp , which I considered as oblique neutral axes , but I have since found that this was owing to the polarisation of the pencil by oblique transmission , a property of light which I had not then discovered .
We have hitherto considered the depolarisation of light as effected by two separate bodies , one of which polarises the incident rays , while the other deprives them of the polarity which they have thus acquired ; but in all bodies that possess oblique depolarising axes , light may be polarised and depolarised by the same crystal .
Thus if ABab , Plate V. , fig. 7 , be a plate of topaz having DE for its oblique depolarising axis , and if a ray RR ' of common light is incident at R ' with such an obliquity that it is polarised by being reflected at C from the posterior surface ab , then the ray rr ' will be depolarised in its passage from C to r along the oblique axis of depolarisation , and the emergent ray rr ' will be delolarised light .
Hence it follows that the angle DCb , which the oblique depolarising axis make8 with the posterior surface ab , is nearly equal to the complement of the angle OCr , at which light is polarised by reflection at C.* V. On the ellfptical coloured rings produced by depolarising Crystals .
In a former work , to which I have already had occasion to refer , I have given some account'of the colours which accompany the depolarisation of light , and I have particularly noticed the remarkable fact , that when a beam of white depolarised light is transmitted through a doubly refracting crystal , the red rays go to the formation of one image , while the bluish green rays go to the formation of the other image .
In repeating and extending these experiments , I have been led into a new field of inquiry which has already afforded a series of instructive results deduced from a class of phenomena unquestionably the most brilliant within the whole range of optics .
The plate of topaz which was used in these experiments , is about - , I of an inch thick , and has two natural faces which are parallel and highly polished .
Its refractive power is 1.636 ; its dispersive power o.024 , and the angle at which it polarises light by reflection 58ยง 8 ' .
It is represented in section by ABab , in Plate V. , fig. 8 , DE being one of its depolarising axes .
If a beam of conmon light RR ' is now incident on the anterior surface AB at an angle of about 60ยง 38 ' , a part of the beam will penetrate the topaz at R , and after reaching the posterior surface ab , it will be partly transmitted at C in the direction CF , and partly reflected in the direction Cr , so as to depart from the point C almost wholly polarised by reflection ; but in its passage from C to r along the oblique depolarising axis of the crystal , it is depolarised and emerges at r , in the direction rr ' deprived of the polarity which it had acquired by reflection at C. If the observer now looks into the topaz in the direction r'r , through a plate of agate having its laminae perpendicular to the plane of the section ABba , he will perceive about ten brilliantly coloured elliptical rings , four of which , with the two central spots , are shown in Plate VI .
, fig. i.* The following measures will convey a correct idea of their form and magnitude .

il o25 If the plate of agate is now turned round 90 ?
, so that its lamina are parallel to the plane of the section ABab , a second set of elliptical rings will ' be seen as represented in Plate VI .
, fig. 2 , which is on the same scale as fig. i , and which contains only the four first orders of colours , and the central spots .
This new set of rings is composed of colours which are complementary to those in the first set .
By measuring the diameters of the red rings in the second set , it will be found that they correspond with those of the green rings in the first set ; the blue rings correspond with the yellow ; the green with the red ; and the yellow with the blue ; and in the outer rings the blue with the pik , and the pink with the blue .
The central spots in the second set exhibit the same opposition of colours to those in thefirst set ; but they are smaller , and placed at a greater distance ; and the space around them which was formerly black is now white .
If instead of a plate of agate we employ a doubly refracting crystal , thefirst set of rings will , in one position of the crystal , be seen in the first image ; and upon turning the crystal about its axis , thefirst set will occupy the second image , and the second set the first image , an alternation taking place in every quadrant of the motion of the crystal .
This method of viewing the rings is in some respects superior to that in which the agate is used , as the nebulous image formed by this mineral injures , in some degree , the distinctness of the image ; but on the other hand , the doubly refracting crystal requires to be cut into a prism with a large angle , in order to separate the two images which it forms , and therefore it alters the shape of the rings , and produces a complete change upon their colours.* ?
Since this paper was written , I have discovered a new property of light in virtue aoIf the emergent rays rr ' , instead of being transmitted through agate or Iceland spar , are reflected at the polarising angle from any transparent body having its reflecting surface parallel to the plane of the section ABab , they will exhibit the first set of rings ; but if the reflecting surface is perpendicular to the plane of the section , the second set of rings will be visible .
When thefirst set , thus seen by reflection , is examined through a prism of Iceland spar , it suffers no change either in the first or second image .
In these experiments thefirst set of rings is extremely distinct , as the polarising crystal extinguishes the light RS reflected from the first surface of the topaz ; but the second set of rings is very faint , as the light RS is not extinguished by the polarising body .
When we examine the transmitted light CF , either with the naked eye or with polarising crystals , no coloured fringes are visible .
Such are the modifications which common light undergoes in its passage through topaz .
The affections of polarised light , which now come under consideration , are still more varied and interesting .
In my first experiments on this subject , I polarised the light by transmitting it through the agate ; but I afterwards found it most convenient to communicate this property by reflection from the surace of a tra3sparent body .
Let RI1 ' , Plate V. , fig. 9 , be a beam of polarised light obtained by reflection from any transparent body GH , the play of which it is polarised by oblique transmission through transparent bodies .
Hence , in all my experinents on the coloured rings , I find it of incalculable advantage to polarise the lght by bundies of gilass plates , and to use them in every case where I formerly employed agate or calcareous spar .
~o7 of reflection from GH being perpendicular to the plane of reflection from the topaz AB .
A part of this beam will be reflected at C in the direction Cr , and part of it transmitted at C in the direction CF , no light being reflected from the first surface AB .
The rays transmitted at C having been polarised before their incidence at R ' are depolarised in passing from R ' to C along the oblique depolarising axis , and the rays reflected at C are polarised by reflection from the surface ab , and again depolarised in their passage from C to r along the other oblique depolarising axis .
If the observer now looks into the topaz in the direction rr , he will perceive thefirst set of elliptical coloured rings , as represented in Plate VI .
, fig. i. These rings are now peculiarly distinct and brilliant , and it was therefore from them that I drew up the table of colours referred to from Plate VII .
, fig. i. Let the ray rr ' be now received upon a plate of agate having its laminae perpendicular to the section ABab , and a third set of rings will be seen like those in Plate VI .
, fig. 3 .
This third set differs from the first set only in the central parts .
All the rings have the same colours in both , but the central spots are much smaller in the third set than in the first , and the mass of darkness with which they are surrounded encroaches considerably upon the blue part of the first ring .
In the third set of rings the distance of the outsides of the two central spots is 33 Conjugate diameter of each spot Ditto of the black space between the .
spots -1 0 The third set , indeed , may be considered as the exact counterpart of the second set , all the colours of the former being 0o8 complementary to those of the latter , and the centr.i sp , t- , having the same form and magnitude .
If the plate of agate is now turned round , so that its laminal are parallel to the section ABab , a fourth set of rings will be seen .
This new set , which is represented in Plate VI .
, fig 4 , is by no means brilliant , but it is distinguished from all the rest by striking peculiarities .
In its general structure it resembles thefirst set , but in the middle of each central spot there is a darker spot composed of blue and red , with a little green above the blue , and every ring is divided into two rings , each of which has the same colours as the original ring .
This division of the rings occupies only a part of the semicircumference of each , and is not seen beyond the third ring .
When the agate begins to move from the position which gives the third set of rings , into that which gives the forth set , two blue spots and the divisions of the rings begin to appear at a , a , a , a a , a , a ' , a ' , a , Plate VII .
, fig. s , and move along the lines abc , a'b'c ' till they arrive at c , c c , c , c , c ' , , when the rings assume the appearance of the fourth set .
If the agate performs another revolution of go9 from the position which gives thefourth set into that which gives the third set , the blue spots , and the divisions of the rings move off in the direction c , d e , c ' , d ; e ' till the rings assume the appearance of the third set .
The phenomena which have now been described may also be perceived , when the polarisation of the rays rr ' is effected either by a doubly refracting crystal or by reflection .
In one position of the doubly refracting crystal the third set of rings is seen in the first image , and the fourth set in the second image , and they alternate in every quadrant of the motion of the crystal .
When the ray rr ' is reflected from a transparent body , so that the plane of reflection is parallel to thie plane of reflection from the topaz , thefourth set of rings will be visible .
Hitherto we have attended only to the light reflected from ab , the posterior surface of the topaz ; but the light transmitted at C exhibits also interesting phenomena .
When the observer looks through the topaz in the direction FC , so as to see the polarising surface GH , the second set of rings is faintly visible .
They become extremely distinct , however , when viewed through a plate of agate having its laminx at right angles to the plane ABab .
If the laminae are parallel to the plane ABab , the second set is converted into thefirst set with colours a little paler than when it was produced in the former experiments .
In the preceding experiments the plane of reflection from GH has been perpendicular to the plane of reflection from the topaz .
We shall now describe the phenomena which take place when these planes are parallel to each other , an arrangement which is represented in Plate V. , fig. Io .
When the observer looks into the topaz in the direction rr , he will perceive the second set of fringes .
If the rays rr ' are transmitted through a plate of agate having its lamitae perpendicular to the plane of reflection , the fourth set of fringes will be seen , but they are very much fainter than they appeared in the former experiments .
When the laminae of the agate are parallel to the plane of reflection , the second set is faintly visible .
The central spots are , however , rather larger than before , so that this set has the appearance of being the reverse of thefirst rather than of the third set .
When the light transmitted in the direction CF is seen by the naked eye , it exhibits thefirst set of rings .
If it is examined through a plate of agate having its veins perpendicular to the O10 plane of reflection , thefirst set is still visible ; but when the agate is turned round 90 the second set is perceived .
All the preceding observations were made with a plate of topaz -t ?
3 of an inch thick .
When the plate has a greater thickness the rings are much smaller , and when it has a less thickness the rings are extremely large , so that in very thin plates , only a small portion of a ring can be perceived at once .
We have already seen that with a plate -r-o " of an incl thick , the fourth red ring subtends an angle of 18 30o ' .
With another plate -i-J7 of an inch thick , the angle subtended by the same ring is 8ยง 24 ' .
But since 2 IF .
_ 103 _180 30 o82 0o o 'I ooo -O 1S it follows that the conjugate diameters of the rings are inversely as the thickness of the plates .
According to the Abbd HAJY , the angle formed by two of the primitive faces of the topaz is 24 , 22 ' ; and therefore the axes or longest diagonals of the primitive rectangular prism will form angles of 60ยง 31 ' 15 ' " with a line perpendicular to the lamine , a result which agrees so nearly with 60ยง 38 ' , the inclination of the axes of the coloured rings , that we can have no hesitation in concluding that the axes of the coloured rings are coincident with the longest diagonals of the primitive rectangular prism .
The rings which have now been described as produced by topaz , I have discovered in rock crystal , mica , the agate , the oriental ruby , the emerald , native hydrate of magnesia , amber , ice , sulphate of potash , tartrate of potash and soda , nitrate of potash , acetate of lead , acetate of lead melted and cooled , prussiate ofpot* According to my own measurements the angle is 123ยง 58 ' , which gives 6o0 t8 ' z6 " for the inclination of the diagonals .
Ee o 211 ash , mother of pearl , bones of a cod , quill , the human nail , horn , tortoise she/ l , cornea of afish , cornea of a cow , cornea of a man , spermaceti , RUPERT'S drops , gum Arabic , and caoutchouc .
i. Rock crystal .
The only specimen of this mineral which I could obtain when I made the preceding experiments , was in the form of a double convex lens about 4- , of an inch thick .
It exhibited only segments of the coloured rings , but they were very large and brilliant , and afforded me the means of making a very interesting experiment with a plate of agate .
If a beam of common light is incident upon the neutral axis of this crystal , at such an angle that after reflection from its posterior surface , it shall emerge in the direction of its oblique depolarising axis , the light thus polarised by reflection and de .
polarised by transmission through the depolarising axis will reach the eye in the state of white light .
If this light is viewed through agate , one of the coloured segments , suppose green , will be distinctly visible ; but if the agate is turned 90o round , the green colour will be converted into red , and in general the colour seen in one position of the agate will be complementary to that which is seen in the other position .
When the light , however , is brilliant , another very singular phenomenon presents itself .
If the bright image seen through the agate is green , the nebulous image , in which it is enclosed , will be red ; and when the bright image is red , the nebulous image will be green , and in general the colour of the nebulous image will be always complementary to that of the bright image .
If we employ a prism of Iceland spar to examine the depolarised 'light , the colour of the ordinary image is always complementary to that of the extraordinary image .
We may therefore consider the preceding result as an experimentum crucis , which establishes the opinion respecting the structure of the agate , that has been given in another part of this paper .
2 .
Mica .
The coloured rings are distinctly visible in mica , both when the light is transmitted perpendicularly through the plate , and when it is incident in the direction of its oblique depolarising axis .
The irregular structure of this mineral , however , and the impossibility of procuring laminae with parallel and even surfaces prevented me from investigating the phenomena of its coloured rings .
S. Agate .
The only plate of agate in which I have observed the coloured rings , is cut in such a direction that it does not polarise the bright image .
It possesses , however , the faculty of depolarisation , and therefore must form two bright images one of which lies immediately above the other .
This plate is about Io~ of an inch thick , contains no veins , and exhibits broad segments of coloured rings .
4 .
Oriental ruby .
This doubly refracting crystal affords beautiful rings , in which , owing to the colour of the mineral , the predominant colours are crimson , light blue , and bluish green .
The central spots were distinctly visible , and though the crystal was isof an inch thick , the rings appeared to be larger than those given by topaz -io3s of an inch thick .
5 .
Emerald .
The coloured rings formed by this stone are principally blue and greenish yellow , the least refrangible rays being extinguished by the green colour of the mineral .
G. Native hydrate of magnesia .
This mineral affords very distinct segments of coloured rings when the light is transmitted in a direction nearly perpendicular to the surface of the laminx .
Owing to the imperfect structure of the plates , I could not obtain a measure of the diameter of the rings .
Amber .
As this substance possesses no crystalline form , and does not split into laminae , I found it impossible to make any satisfactory experiments with it .
The enormous breadth of its coloured rings was conspicuous in every specimen , but though I ground and polished more than twenty plates of it , I could not obtain one which exhibited any thing more than broad coloured segments .
With a parallelopiped of amber 0.566 of an inch long , 0.300 broad , and 0.367 deep , the coloured segments were visible in every direction in which the light was transmitted .
They appeared most distinct through the thickness 0.367 ; and through the thickness 0.566 they were still so broad , that no more than one colour of each ring could be seen .
In a piece of amber - ?
of an inch thick , the rings were broader than in a plate of topaz 3g0 of an inch thick .
8 .
Ice .
The difficulty of making experiments upon ice without melting it , the want of a crystalline form , and the impracticability of shaping it into parallel plates prevented me from obtaining any accurate results .
The following experiments , however , will throw some light upon this subject .
A piece of ice xof an inch thick gave rings much broader than those exhibited by a plate of topaz 3of an inch thick .
The rings were also seen by the reflection of common light from the posterior surface of the ice , the light reflected from the anterior surface being extinguished by a prism of calcareous spar .
A piece of ice 4of an inch thick exhibited rings larger than those given by a plate of topaz -3of an inch thick .
The breadth of one of the fringes shown by a plate of ice 9-4 of an inch thick was nearly 5ยง 26 ' , which compared with the -14 results already mentioned , gives ?
'for thetthickness of a plate of topaz that would produce a fringe of the same magnitude .
Hence the thicknesses of ice and topaz that give rings of equal size are as 4 to -2 , or as 8.95 to i , which is nearly the inverse ratio of ( n-)3 in ice to ( m ' .
)3 in topaz , m and m ' being the indices of refraction .
If we take m= 1.307 and m'-1.636 , this ratio will be nearly as 8.9 to i. In these experiments the two oval central spots were distinctly seen .
Light transmitted at an angle of 46 ?
through a plate of ice 1.25 inches thick gives rings of the same size as when it is transmitted at an angle of 60ยง 38 ' through a plate of topaz 1030 of an inch thick .
By calculating the real thicknesses in the direction of the transmitted light , it will be found that the thicknesses at which ice and topaz produce rings of the same magnitude are as 8.4 to i , a ratio not very remote from that of ( m )3 in ice to ( m')3 in topaz .
Light transmitted at an incidence of 36 ?
through a plate of ice 6-oof an inch thick gave rings twice as large as those shown by a plate of topaz io of an inch thick .
These thicknesses will be found , after reduction , to be as 8.2 to i , a ratio more remote than any of the former from that of ( m i ) to ( m'1)3 A plate of ice taken from the surface of a pool of water did not appear to depolarise light , when it was incident perpendicularly : but when the angle of incidence was considerable , the light was depolarised in every direction , and the coloured rings appeared even at great obliquities .
9 .
Sulphate ofpotash .
A plate of sulphate of potash i30_ of an inch thick gave fringes of colour , each of which was ?
in breadth , while another plate -Jgo of an inch thick gave 215 fringes 3ยง 2i in breadth .
Now 135 : 168 =l i ' : 4 nearly , so that the diameters of the rings are inversely as the thicknesses of the plates , as in the case of topaz .
The light was incident on the sulphate of potash at an angle of 41 ?
, which gives -r79_ for the oblique thickness of the plate -tj3 of an inch thick .
Now 0oo : 15.-- : 2_ 2 .
the size of the ring that would have been produced by a plate of topaz , J7r_ of an inch thick , so that the thicknesses of sulphate of potash and topaz that produce equal rings are as 1.85 to 1 , which is not very far from the ratio of ( mi)3 to ( m'-)3 .
If we take m= 1.o09 and m'1.636 this ratio will be as 1.95 to i. 1o .
Tartrate of potash and.oda .
The neutral axes of this salt are parallel and perpendicular to the axis of the prism , and it possesses an oblique depolarising axis along which the coloured rings are visible .
The thicknesses of this substance and of topaz , at which equal rings are produced , are as 31 : -16 , which is almost exactly the ratio of ( m)3 to ( m'i)3 The value of m ' in the tartrate being t.s515 it .
Nitrate of potash .
This salt , which is remarkable for its optical properties , * exhibits along the axis of the hexaedral prism a series of beautiful miniature rings , tweve of which are distinctly visible .
In a plate of the nitrate of potash 4 of an inch thick , the fourth ring subtended an angle of 5ยง 45 ' whereas , in a plate of topaz of an inch thick , it subtended an angle of 8 ?
,5 ' .
But 2i7 58 45t 8ยง 25 ' % 40:'roJ the thickness of topaz that would give the fourth ring a diameter of 5ยง 45 ' .
Hence the thicknesses at which the nitrate of potash and topaz produce rings of equal magnitude are as " ioo to _7- , or as I to 3.97 nearly .
But assuming the rings to vary as ( m -)3 , those formed by the nitrate should have been larger than those exhibited by the topaz in the ratio of 6363 : 5153 , or nearly 1.88 to i. Hence the rings formed by nitrate of potash are 1.88 x.97 , or 7.5 times smaller than they should be if their conjugate diameters had varied as ( m-i)3.* 12 .
Acetate of lead .
This doubly refracting crystal melts at a temperature not much greater than that which bees ' wax requires , and it takes a long time to cool and crystallize .
When it is formed by heat into a thin film between two plates , the crystals shoot from different centres , and exhibit by polarised light the most beautiful alternations of the prismatic colours .
When the eye is kept at a distance from the plate , the colours radiate like the spicula of the salt , and vary at every inclination of the plate .
3 .
Mother of pearl .
The coloured rings are extremely brilliant in this substance when the polarised light is transmitted almost perpendicularly ; but they do not appear when it penetrates by an oblique path .
The other substances , which have already been mentioned as affording coloured rings by polarised light , exhibit only imperfect segments of the fringes , but in all of them these segments are distinctly visible , excepting in caoutchouc , where the colours are extremely faint .
It is highly probable that the coloured rings will be found in a still greater number of crystallized bodies .
I have sought for them in vain in the diamond , native orpiment , Iceland spar , fluor spar , muriate of soda , carbonate of lead , carbonate of barytes , the sclerotic coat of the eye , the crystalline lens , and a great variety of other bodies , and in some of these with so much care , that they could scarcely have escaped my notice , if they did exist .
It therefore still remains to be determined , what kind of crystallization is necessary to their production , and what relation exists between the magnitude of the rings and the refractive power of the body which produces them .
In some of the experiments already described , the diameters of the rings seem to vary as ( m-1 )3 , but the anomalies exhibited by amber and nitrate of potash completely prove that this is not the law by which their magnitude is regulated .
