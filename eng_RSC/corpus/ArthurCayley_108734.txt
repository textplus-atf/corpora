On the Porism of the in-and-circumscribed Polygon .
By ARTHUR CAYLEY , Esq. F.R.S. Received February 20 , -Read March 7 , 1861 .
THE Porism referred to is as follows , viz. that two conics may be so related to each other , that a polygon may be inscribed in the one , and circumscribed about the other conic , in such manner that any point whatever of the circumscribing conic may be taken for a vertex of the polygon .
I gave in the year 1853 , in the Philosophical Magazine* , a general formula for the relation between the two conics , viz. if U=O0 is the equation of the inscribed conic , V=O that of the circumscribed conic , and if disct .
( U+%V ) , where a is an arbitrary multiplier , denotes the discriminant of U+ V in regard to the coordinates ( x , y , z ) ( such discriminant being of course a cubic function in regard to k , and also in regard to the coefficients of the two conics U , V , jointly ) , then if we write v/ disct .
( U+ V ) =A+B+CO2 +D3+ E4+Fr+G6+ &amp;c. , the relations for the cases of the triangle , pentagon , heptagon , &amp;c. are C=0 , C , D =0 , C , D , E =- , &amp;c. D , E D , OF E , F , G respectively , while those in the cases of the quadrangle , hexagon , octagon , &amp;c. are D=O , D , E 0 , D , E , F =0 , &amp;c. E , F E , F , G F , G , H respectively .
The demonstration of this fundamental theorem is for greater completeness here reproduced ; but the chief object of the memoir is to direct attention to a curious analytical theorem which is an easy a priori consequence of the Porism , and to obtain the relations for the several polygons up to the enneagon , in a new and simple form which puts in evidence 'a posteriori for these cases the analytical theorem just referred to .
The analytical theorem rests upon the following considerations : the relation for a hexagon ought to include that for a triangle ; in fact a triangle with its sides in order twice over is a form of hexagon ; the condition for an octagon should in like manner include that for a quadrangle ; and so in other cases .
Let the cubic function , disct .
( U + V ) , be represented by l+IP+7-t2+ , the coefficients A , B , C , D , E , &amp;c. are functions of 3 , y , 5 .
Write C =(3 ) D =(4 ) , c , D =(5 ) , D , E ID , E =(6 ) , E , F c , D , E -(7 ) , D , E , F iE , F , G &amp;c. then ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) are respectively prime functions of 3 , y , b ; that is they cannot be decomposed into factors , rational functions of these quantities ; and it is convenient to denote this by writing ( 3)=[3 ] , ( 4)=[4 ] , ( 5)= [ 5 ] .
But by what precedes , ( 6 ) contains the factor ( 3 ) , that is [ 3 ] ; and if the other factor , which is prime , is denoted by [ 6 ] , then we have ( 6)=[6 ] [ 3 ] .
The next term ( 7 ) is prime , that is we have ( 7)=[7 ] ; but the term ( 8 ) gives ( 8)=[8 ] [ 4 ] ; the term ( 9 ) gives ( 9)=[9 ] [ 3 ] ; and so on .
Thus we have ( 12)=[12 ] [ 6 ] [ 4 ] [ 3 ] , the numbers in [ ] being all the factors , the number itself included , and as well composite as prime , of the number in ( ) , the factors 2 and 1 being however excluded .
To make this clearer , it may be remarked that the last-mentioned equation has the geometrical signification that the relation for a dodecagon is the aggregate of the relations for a proper dodecagon , a proper hexagon , a quadrangle , and a triangle ; that is , the relation for a dodecagon implies one or other of the lastmentioned relations .
The relations for the several polygons up to the enneagon are in the memoir obtained in a form which puts in evidence the property in question , that is , the series of equations ( 3)=[3 ] , ( 4)=t[4 ] , ( 5)==[5 ] , ( 6)=[6 ] [ 3 ] , ( 7)=[7 ] , ( 8)=[8 ] [ 4 ] ( 9)=[9 ] [ 3 ] To do this , the discriminant is represented , not as above in terms of the constants 3 , y , S , but in a somewhat different form , by means of the constants b , c , d , the last two 226 whereof are such that c=O is the relation for the triangle , d=0O the relation for the quadrangle ; thus [ 3]=c , [ 4]=d , and for the particular cases considered , the analytical theorem consists herein , that c is a factor of ( 6 ) , and of ( 9 ) , and that d is a factor of ( 8 ) .
I have , for the sake of homogeneity , introduced into the formulae the quantity a ( =1 ) , but this is a matter of form only .
The functions 3 ] , 4 ] , &amp;c. have been spoken of as prime they are so , in fact , as far as they are calculated ; and that they are so in general rests on the assumption that for a polygon of a given number of sides , there is but one form of relation : if , for instance , in the equation [ 12]=0 , which is the condition for a proper dodecagon , the function [ 12 ] could be decomposed into rational factors ; then equating each of these factors to zero , we should have so many distinct forms of relation for a proper dodecagon .
I believe that the assumption and reasoning are valid ; but without entering further into this , I take it for granted that in the general case the functions [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , &amp;c. are in fact prime .
But the coefficients j , y , S , or b , c , d , instead of being so many independent arbitrary quantities , may be given as rational functions of other quantities ( if , for instance , the two conics are circles , radii R , r , and distance between the centres a , then 03 , y , Swill be functions of R , r , a ) : and it is in a case of this kind quite conceivable that the functions [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , &amp;c. , considered as functions of these new elements , should cease to be prime functions .
In fact , in the case just referred to of the two circles ( the original case of the Porism as considered by Firss ) , the functions [ 4 ] , [ 6 ] , &amp;c. , which correspond to a polygon of an even number of sides , appear to be each of them decomposable into two factors : the memoir contains some remarks tending to show a priori that in the case in question this decomposition takes place .
I was led to examine the point by the elegant formulae obtained in an essentially different manner by M. MENTION , Bull .
de l'Acad .
de St. Pet. t. i. pp. 15 , 30 , and 507 ( 1860 ) , in reference to the case of the two circles ( it thereby appears that the decomposition takes place for the quadrangle and the hexagon ) ; and these formulae are reproduced in the memoir .
I. Demonstration of the general Formula of the Relation between the two Conics .
The equation of a conic passing through the points of intersection of the conics U=O , V=o , is of the form U+mV=0 , where m is an arbitrary parameter .
Suppose that the conic touches a given line , we have for the determination of ma quadratic equation ; and conversely , if the roots of this quadratic equation are given , the line is also given ; that is , the two roots may be considered as parameters which determine the particular line .
Let k be a given value of m ; the parameters of any tangent of the conic U+-kV O are k , p , but as k is common to all the tangents , we may consider the particular tangent 22 227 as determined by the single parameter p. And a point of the conic U+kIV=0 may be considered as determined by the same parameter p which determines the tangent at that point .
As regards the conic V=0 , the common parameter for all its tangents is 0o , and we may consider any other tangent of this conic as determined by the pararo ' 1 , and a point of the conic as determined by the same parameter 0 .
Suppose , in the first instance , that the two conics are U ax+by2+cz2=O , V= x2+ y2+ z2=0 ; the equation of the tangent of U+kV-0 , the parameter whereof isp ( in fact a common tangent of the conics U+kV=0 , U+pV=O ) , is easily found to be ^v/ ^^^/ a4^\^k +P av a , ,/ +^kVb+ C+kV e+pv b--Cva+ +/ a+p +yl/ G--f/ 15 f^ &gt; / b+ +Z &gt; / 66 -b / C +ksc+ = Op ; and if this meet the conic V=0 in the points P , P ' , the parameters whereof are o , 0 , and oo , 6 ' , or say d and d ' respectively , then the coordinates of the point P are given by x. : y : z= / b-cV/ a+O : Vc-av/ b+ .
: Va-b/ c+d ; and substituting these values in the foregoing equation , we have ( b-)Vc)a+kV/ a+pVa++(c-a)v'+kVb+pVb+0 ?
( a-- ) c+kbVc+pVc+d ?
O as an equation connecting the parameters p and 0 .
This equation may be replaced by a/ ( a+k)(a+p)(a+Q)=-x+a , V(b+k)(b +p)(b +O)=x+b , / ( c +k)(c +p)(c += x+pC , from which X , / are to be eliminated ; and squaring and reducing , we have 2= abc+kpO , -2xp= bc+ca+ab ( pO + kp --kO ) , 2=a+b+c+k+p+O , and thence ( bc+ca+ab-p8-kpk0)2-4(a+b+ c+k+p+O)(abc+kp ) O as the rational form of the original equation .
But the same rational equation would , it is clear , be obtained from the system V/ ( k +a)(k+ b)(k + c)=L+Mk , / ( p+a)(_p+b)(p+c)=L+Mp , V/ ( d + a)(0 + b)(0 + c)=L+Md , by the elimination of L and M. And it follows from ABEL'S theorem ( but the result might be verified by means of EULER'S fundamental theorem for the addition of elliptic functions ) , that if 228 n = ( t +a b ) ( + c ) then that the last-mentioned system is equivalent to the transcendental equation 110=nIIp+ ?
k , in which the arbitrary constant which should have been inserted , and the sign of 1i1 , are determined by the consideration that for k=-x ( which gives 1Hk=O ) we ought to have 0=p , and therefore =10-= Ip .
There is of course a similar equation in D ' , and the terms with IIk must be taken with opposite signs , and we have thence the theorem , " If 0 , 0 ' are the parameters of the points P , P ' in which the conic V= 0 is intersected by the tangent , the parameter whereof is p , of the conic U+kV=O , then the equations Il = ip-Ilk , nII='-= p+IIk , determine the parameters , , 0 ' of the points in question .
" And again , " If the two variable parameters 0 , 0 ' are connected by the equation I10'I d0 2Tk , then the line PP ' will be a tangent of the conic U+-kV=O .
" The foregoing demonstration relates to the particular forms U =ax2+by2+ cz , V =x2+y+z2 ; but observing that the function\/ ( a+a)(+-b)( +c ) , which enters under the integral sign in the transcendental function 11I , is the square root of the discriminant of U+-V , the theory of covariants shows at once that the conclusions apply to any forms whatever of U , V , the expression for the transcendental function being ~ J , = , Vdisct .
( U+ +V ) Consider now a triangle inscribed in the conic V=0 , and with its sides touching the conics U+kV =0 , U+k'V =0 , U+k"V 0 .
Then if 0 , d ' , 0 " are the parameters of the angles , we have I10"-10 ' = 2Ik , 11B W1'=21 , k ' , 110 ' 10 = 21Hk " , and thence Ilk+ Hk'+ + Ik"0 as the relation which must subsist between the parameters k , k,1 of the conics touched by the sides ; and similarly for a polygon of n sides ; the relation between the parameters is nIk , t+nkt+ .
+.Ilk.-o .
229 But by ABEL'S theorem , this transcendental equation is equivalent to an algebraical one .
In fact , calling the radical / Ox , then if px , yx are rational and integral functions of x with arbitrary coefficients , and if,2x-2x x=-A(x--k , )(x-k , ) ... ( x-k- ) ( this implies that p2x is of a degree not exceeding n and X2^x of a degree not exceeding n-.3 ; that is , for n even the degrees of px , xx are -5n , ( n-4 ) ; and for n odd they are -(n -1 ) , ( n3 ) ) , then the algebraical equation is that obtained by the elimination of the arbitrary coefficients from the system of equations k , ++Xkl Ok = 0 , pk2 +O k2 =0 , k.+Xkx O kn-O ; or , what is the same thing , for n odd =2-1 , it is { 1 , d , ... .-1 , d/ O , 0/ D0,..0p-2 0/ C O- , and for n even , =2p , it is { 1 , 0,. .
, 0 , ... , / , / ,..dp-2 V }=O , where the expressions in { } denote respectively the determinants , of 2--1 lines , and 2p lines , formed by substituting for d the values k , , k2 , ... k. respectively .
Thus for n= 3 , the equation is 1 , k , , / D=o ; 1 , , VJ , k2 1 , k3 , Vok3 and for n=4 , it is 1 , k , , k : , / okl =0 , 1 , k2 , k2 , VOk2 1 , 14 , 5 k , / Ok and so on .
Suppose ^o/ =A+B +CBe f+Dr3+E 4+ ... ; then substituting the corresponding expressions for V/ a kl , 1/ Dk , &amp;c. , the determinant will divide by { 1 , d , 02,. . ?
-1 } , and it may be seen without difficulty that the resulting equation on putting therein k.=-k ... .
== 0 , will , according as n-=3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , &amp;c. , be C= , D= , D =0 , D , E 0 , C , D , E =0 , &amp;c. , D , E OF D , E , Fj E , F , G which is the theorem above referred to .
230 Application to the several Polygons up to the Enieagon .
If the equation of the inscribed conic is U=O , and that of the circumiscribed conic is V= 0 , and if the discriminant ( U + V ) is in the first instance represented by 1+ 43+ -4y2+43 , then the square root of the discriminant is 1+ 2p+ 2(y--2)k2+ 2(-(2Pr+ 2I3 ) 2+ &amp; .
, so that the condition for the triangle is y-P32= 0 , and that for the quadrangle is -23y+233= 0 .
It is obviously convenient to introduce into the formulae , in the place of y and 5 , the quantities d=_z-2I3y+2f33 ; and writing also , for symmetry of notation , 6 in the place of / 3 , we have =b ; , r=c+b-2 , 6 =d+2bc , so that the discriminant will be =1+ 4b + 4(c+ 62)2+ 4(d+ 2bc)a3 , which is =(1 +2b+2ce2)2+4(d3--c24 ) .
But for homogeneity I introduce the quantity a--= , and put the discriminant -(1 +2b+2a2)2+ 4a2(da3c-4 ) .
The square root , divided by a2 , is =(1 + 2b+2ac2)/ l +4a2(d ( -I24 ) ( 1 +2b+ 2ac2)2 ; or developing , this is ( 1 +26b+2acS ) , +2 ( d-'-c2t ) ( l1+2b.+2ac22 ) 2a2(d3 -c24)2 ( 1 +2b6+2ac2)3 + 4a4(d3 --c24)~ + ( 1 +2b+ 2ac~2)6 -10a6(d3--c2a4)4 -(1i+2b6+2ac2)7 + &amp;c. ; 231 or representing this by 1+2Bq+2C'2+2D33+ &amp;c. , we have C2+D3 +E4 +F5 +GE6+HE7+IEr+ J9+KE'o+L I +ME'2+. .

The foregoing values show that 23 and 1234 ( which belong to the hexagon and the enneagon ) divide by c ( which belongs to the triangle ) , and that 234 ( which belongs to the octagon ) divides by d ( which belongs to the quadrangle ) .
But I was not prepared for the destruction which will be observed in the several determinants , of the terms involving the lower powers of a ( that is , the terms of the highest orders in b , c , d ) , and which renders these expressions so much more simple than they would otherwise have been .
Representing the reduced equations for the several polygons , as before , by [ 3]=0 , [ 4]=0 , [ 5]=0 , [ 6]-0 , [ 7]=0 , [ 8]=0 , [ 9]=0 , &amp;c. Then retaining the quantity a(=l ) for homogeneity , but rejecting the powers of a which divide out , and reversing in some cases the signs , the values of the functions [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , &amp;c. are [ 3]= [ 4]= [ 5]= [ 6]= [ 71= [ 8= [ 9]= +1 c +1 d +1 ad +2 ad2 +1 a2d4 +1 a2d +3 a3d +2 bed +2 bed -+2 abed3 +4 abed3 +12 a bed5 +1 3+1 c3 -1 ac3d2 +4 ac3d2 +4 a2e'd4 -2 bc4d +4 b2C2d2 d+16 ab2cd4 -1 c6 +e 6 bc4d -14 abc4d3 +2 c6 4 +3 ac6d2 + &amp; b3cd3 + 12 b2e5d -+ 6 bc7d +1 e9 +1 +1 1 +4 ; +5 -1 +21 +79 234 The similarity of form for the relations corresponding to the pentagon and the hexagon , and for those corresponding to the heptagon and the octagon , is , I am inclined to think , accidental ; the functions are homogeneous as regards degree and weight ; and the degrees and weights of the two consecutive functions being identical , the literal parts must be similarly constituted .

M. MENTION'S Formulv for the Case of two Circles .
In the case of two circles , if , as usual , the radii of the inscribed and circumscribed circles are put equal to r and R respectively , and the distance of their centres to a , then the equations of the inscribed and circumscribed circles respectively may be taken to be x2-y2+-r2=0 , ( x-a +Y2 -R O ; and if , in the notation of M. MENTION , we put a2 ( r4 + R4+a4_ 2r2R2 2r2a2R 2a 2)= then the quadratic radical is / ( + 4){1 +(2 + 2i)]2 + 42 } ; and comparing this with / 1 + 4b + 4(c+ b2)E2+ 4(d+ 2bc)e3 , we have b =i +2 , c+ bi2=i2+6i+v+5 , d+2bc= 4 ( i2+2i+ 1 ) , and thence b= i+2 , c= 2i-+v + 1 , d= 2i-2i ; and by means of these values , or by effecting the development in a different manner , we find B= c= +2 , C_ { i.2 1+V+1 , D=2 { i(-v-1 ) } , E= F i. 4v +i.4(+l ) l )2 2X2 235These values give CEDFD C , , ] D , E , ] E , F , ( D , E , ] E , F , ( F , G , ] MB .

M. MENTION has also given , but not in a developed form , the formulae for the enneagon and the endecagon , and the following formula for the decagon , viz. [ 16i +(v+l)4]2+6i2(V +l ) .

Considerations as to the form of relation , in the case of two circles , for Polygons of an odd and even number of sides respectively .
The relation between the two conics , or condition for the existence of the polygon , is the same whatever point of the circumscribed conic is taken as an angle of the polygon .
Take for an angle , a point of intersection of the two conics .
Consider first the case of the triangle ; if a point of intersection is taken as a vertex A of the triangle , then the sides AB , AC coincide in direction with the tangent at A to the inscribed conic U , hence B and C coincide together at the point where this tangent meets the circumscribed conic V , BC is therefore a tangent of V , but it is by hypothesis a tangent of U ; hence for the triangle the relation between the inscribed conic U and the circumscribed conic V is as follows , viz. a tangent to U at a point of intersection with V meets V at a point of contact of a common tangent of U and V. In like manner for the quadrangle , if A be taken at a point of intersection , the sides AB and AD will coincide in direction with the tangent to IU at this point , consequently B and D must coincide at the point where this tangent meets V ; hence also CB , CD , the two tangents to U from the point C , must coincide , or C must be a point of intersection of the conics U , V. In other words , the pole , with respect to the inscribed conic U , of a common chord AC of the two conics must lie on the circumscribed conic V ; this is therefore the condition for the quadrilateral .
In the ordinary mode of drawing the figures , with two conics which do not intersect , the points and lines employed in the foregoing constructions are imaginary , but the conics may be so drawn that these points and lines are all real .
In general , for a polygon of an odd number , 2n+1 , of sides , then starting from a point of intersection , the sides will coincide in pairs , viz. the first and last , second and last but one , and so on , the middle or ( n+l)th side being a common tangent of the two 237 conics .
But for a figure of an even number , 2n , of sides , then starting from a point of intersection of the two conics , the nth side will terminate at a second point of intersection , and then the same series of sides will be repeated in the reverse order , so that the sides will coincide in pairs , first and last , second and last but one , nth and ( n+l)th .
For a figure of an odd number of sides , the relation involves only a single point of intersection , but for a figure of an even number of sides , it involves two points of intersection .
Now in the case of two circles , for a polygon of an odd number of sides , the same relation is obtained , whether we take as the point of intersection one of the actual points of intersection , or a circular point at infinity , and the relation [ 2n+1 ] =0 does not break up into factors .
And so for a polygon of an even number of sides , then taking for the two points of intersection , the two actual points of intersection , or the two circular points at infinity , we have one form of result ; but taking for them an actual point of intersection and a circular point at infinity , we have a different form of result ; and the equation [ 2n]-=0 does break up into factors .
This is verified very simply in the case of the quadrangle .
Taking for the two points of intersection the circular points at infinity , the line joining them is the line infinity , and its pole , with respect to the inscribed circle , is the centre of this circle ; the relation therefore is that the centre of the inscribed circle lies on the circumscribed circle .
But when this is the case , it is easy to see that the pole ( with respect to the inscribed circle ) of the radical axis , lies also on the circumscribed circle ; this pole and the centre of the inscribed circle are in fact the extremities of a diameter of the circumscribed circle .
The condition thus obtained is R2-a2=O ( which is M. MENTION'S condition i=O0 ) .
We have next to find the analytical relation when the pole ( with respect to the inscribed ) circle , of the line joining one of the actual points of intersection with a circular point at infinity is a point on the circumscribed circle .
This I effect as follows:-Taking z=O as the equation of line infinity , if the origin be taken on the middle point of the radical axis , and if x=0 be the radical axis , then the equations of the two circles may be taken to be Inscribed circle , a+y2 -21 xzVz =O .
Circumscribed circle , x2+y2--2Lxz-Vz=0 .
A circular point at infinity is x:y : z=1:i:0 , ( i= / -1 ) .
An actual point of intersection is x:y : z=:/ V : 1 .
The line joining these is xi-y+z / V=O .
Its pole , with respect to the inscribed circle , is x : y : z= --i/ V- : / V-il : 1 .
238 And if this be a point of the circumscribed circle -V+(V -2il)+2Li/ -V=O0 , that is , 2(L-1)iV/ V=2l+v , or ( P2+ V)2+ 4(L1)V=O0 , which is the required relation : but to express it in terms of the ordinary data R , r , a , the equations of the circles , putting therein z=l , become ( s-l )2+y2=v+12 , ( x--L)2+y2VL2 and therefore a =L- , r2 =V+-12 RB=V+Lv ; these equations give RP_-r2 =L+-/ a =L--I and thence R-r2 + a2 L= ' 2a and V= R2(R2a " )21 ( 2a2R22 +a2r2+2r2R -R4-r4-a4 ) r4 4a2 pi if with M. MENTION we write 4(r4-+R4+a4-2r2R-2r2a -2R a2 W2 ) = The equation ( 1+-V)2+4(L)2 V=O thus becomes r4+4a.a2 .
v=-0 , that is , it becomes + 1=0 , which is the other factor of the complete condition i(v+1)=0 .
