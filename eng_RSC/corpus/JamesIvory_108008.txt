THE perturbations of the planets caused by their mutual attraction depend chiefly upon one algebraic expression , from the development of which all the inequalities of their motions are derived .
This function is very complicated , and requires much labour and many tedious operations to expand it in a series of parts which can be separately computed according to the occasions of the astronomer .
The progress of physical astronomy has undoubtedly been retarded by the excessive length and irksomeness attending the arithmetical calculation of the inequalities .
On this subject astronomers generally and continually complain ; and that their complaints are well founded , is very aptly illustrated by a paper contained in the last year 's Transactions of this Society .
The disturbing function is usually expanded in parts arranged according to the powers and products of the excentricities and the inclinations of the orbits to the ecliptic ; and , as these elements are always small , the resulting series decreases in every case with great rapidity .
No difficulty would therefore be found in this research , if an inequality depended solely on the quantity of the coefficient of its argument in the expanded function ; because the terms of the series decrease so fast , that all of them , except those of the first order , or , at most , those of the first and second orders , might be safely neglected , as producing no sensible variation in the planet 's motion .
But the magnitude of an inequality depends upon the length of its period , as well as upon the coefficient of its argument .
When the former embraces a course of many years , the latter , although almost evanescent in the differential equation , acquires a great multiplier in the process of integration , and thus comes to have a sensible effect on the place of the planet .
Such is the origin of some of the most remarkable 4c2 of the planetary irregularities , and in particular , of the great equations in the mean motions of Jupiter and Saturn , the discovery of which does so much honour to the sagacity of LAPLACE .
It is not , therefore , enough to calculate the terms of the first order , or of the first and second orders , in the expansion of the disturbing function .
This is already done in most of the books that treat of physical astronomy with all the care and fulness which the importance of the subject demands , leaving little room for further improvement .
In the present state of the theory of the planetary motions , it is requisite that the astronomer have it in his power to compute any term in the expansion of the disturbing function below the sixth order ; since it has been found that there are inequalities depending upon terms of the fifth order , which have a sensible effect on the motions of some of the planets .
A research that has for its object the lessening of the difficulty attending the expansion of the disturbing function , and the bringing of that expression more under the power of the astronomer , is one of considerable interest , and of some moment to the progress of physical astronomy .
But the question is not to exhibit separately every individual argument with its coefficient , which would be of little utility in practice , since , although their number be infinite , very few of them are of any account in computing the place of a planet .
The end to be aimed at , is to give the function such a form that the astronomer may have it in his power to select any inequality he may wish to examine , and to compute the coefficient of its argument by an arithmetical process of moderate length .
The present Paper is an attempt of this kind .
The investigation comprehends every argument not passing the fifth order ; but , as the formulas are regular , the method may be extended indefinitely to any order .
1 .
Let x , y , z , represent the rectangular coordinates of the disturbed planet , z being perpendicular to a fixed plane passing through the sun 's centre , at which point the origin of the coordinates is placed : in like manner let ' , y ' , z ' be the coordinates of the disturbing planet ; and put m ' for the proportion of the mass of this planet to the sum of the masses of the sun and the disturbed planet ; then , R denoting the disturbing function , we shall have , { , ~r 21 xx ' 4- , Jy +z 2 ) I Rf r and r ' denote the distancs of te disur and dg p++ ns If r and r ' denote the distances of the disturbed and disturbing planets from 560 the sun 's centre ; w , their angular distance seen at the same point ; and ?
, their rectilinear distance from one another , then , = r22 rr ' cos w+ r'2 R1r cos mI = r'2 * It appears , therefore , that the function to be expanded consists of two parts , of which- , the reciprocal of the distance of the two planets , is common to the disturbing functions of both ; but this is not the case with the other part , in which r and r ' do not enter alike .
For this reason it will contribute to distinctness to expand the two parts separately .
But , previously , it is necessary to express cos s in terms of the angular motions of the planets in their respective orbits .
If v represent the angular distance of the disturbed planet in its orbit from a fixed origin , and P the place of the node , that is , of the intersection of the orbit with the immovable plane of xy , P being reckoned in the same plane and from the same origin as Y , then up will be the angular distance of the planet from the node .
Further , if A be the celestial arc between the node and the intersection of the orbits of the two planets , the distance of the planet from the same intersection will be equal to v -PA .
If the foregoing symbols be accented and transferred with like significations to the disturbing planet , the celestial arc between that planet and the intersection of the orbits will be equal to v ' -P'-A ' .
Now vPA and ' P ' A ' are two sides of a triangle of which the arc o is the third side ; wherefore if I be the inclination of the two orbits , we shall have cos = cos ( v P A ) cos ( 'P'A ' ) + cos I sin ( v P A ) sin ( v ' P ' A ' ) , or , which is the same thing , cos = cos2 I.cos ( vo'P + P'A + A ' ) + sin2 I.cos ( v + u-PP P -A ) .
561 Let N be the place of the node of the disturbed planet reckoned in the imnoveable plane of x y , and i the inclination of the orbit to the same plane : then , if v represent the longitude of the intersection of the orbits of the two planets , A will be the hypothenuse of a right-angled triangle , of which i is one angle , and un the side adjacent to i ; wherefore tan ( v N ) tanA= cs ... cosi and , by the usual methods , A=vN+ tan2 sin 2 ( v N ) + tan2 sin 4 ( v N ) , &amp;c. and if we put tan2 sin 2 ( v N ) + tan2 sin4 ( -N ) , &amp;c. , we shall have P+A=v+P-N+ .
Let [ PN ] be the value of PN at some given epoch : then the differentials of N and P being dN and cos i. dN , we shall have generally , PN = [ PN ] -fdN +cosi.dN = [ P-N]2fsin2 dN , the integral being taken for the time elapsed from the epoch .
It thus appears that P -Nmay be considered as an invariable arc , or as one subject to an almost insensible secular equation .
In order to abridge expressions , let us now put = [ PN ] 2fsin2 dN + E ; then Y A= v. If the symbols which stand for the elements of the disturbed planet be assumed , when accented , to represent the like elements of the disturbing planet , we shall have similarly , [ PN ' ] 2fsin2 i dN ' + ' , v'--P ' A'-A '-'-- .
562 The value of cos w will now be thus expressed , cos w= cos2 CO I. cos ( v ' + os ' ) + sin2 I. cos ( + ~ ' ' -2 v ) .
It remains to determine I , the inclination of the orbits , and v , the longitude of their intersection .
Now I is the vertical angle of a triangle of which N N ' is the base , and i and i ' the adjacent angles , one being interior and the other exterior to the triangle : wherefore cos I= cos i cos i ' + sin i sin i ' cos ( N N ' ) .
In the same triangle , a perpendicular being let fall upon the base from the vertical angle , un and v N ' are the arcs between the perpendicular and the extremities of the base ; and hence , ot( N+ N'\ sin(i-i ' ) N-N ' cot y ) sin ( i + i ) cot In the method here followed , the expression of cos w is as simple and as little troublesome in calculation , as it would be if one of the orbits were adopted for the immovable plane .
2 .
Let 5 , s , e , z represent the mean motion , the epoch , the excentricity , and the place of the perihelion , of the disturbed planet at the time for which we are computing : if this time be near the epoch for which the elements have been assigned , the values at the epoch may be taken as the true values ; and if a great interval has elapsed , the values at the epoch may be corrected by their secular equations .
Further , put p for the mean anomaly , o for the equation of the centre , a for the mean distance , and a ( 1s ) for the radius vector : then , v=C +s + , f+ == s+i w , =a ( 1 s ) And the values of s and s , found by the solution of KEPLER'S problem , are expressed by the usual series , viz. 563 = e. 2 sin , i s=-e cos , 5 sin2 2 cosQ1 +e2 e2 +e2 .

If these values , as well the values of r and r ' , be substituted in that part of the disturbing function which is more easily dealt with , we shall obtain , r cos wa91s r2-= * , , .

5'66 The other part of the expansion , that multiplied by e(i ) e'( ' ) sin2 1 I , will be different in no respect from the part just computed except in the arguments of the cosines , which must be changed according to the rule already laid down ; so that , instead of the four cosines above , these which follow must be substituted respectively , cos ( p + p ' 2vi i ' ) cos ( p + p'2 Y+i~+i ~ ' ) cos ( ( p +(2 i , + ?
-i ' ' ) cos ( p +'2v+ i( i ' ' ) .
Every part of the expansion being comprehended in the formula , it follows that all the arguments will contain the mean motions of the planets , excepting the particular case when i= 1 , i'= 1 : for , in this case , p and p ' -are independent of the mean motions ; and the first cosines of the two parts multiplied by e e ' will be , cos ( sz 'a+ a ' ) cos ( w +z2v ' ) .
These cosines have the same coefficient , viz. A a(1 + B(1 ) B(1 ) a( ) +A 1 ) 4 -~ 4 And this will be found equal to zero , when the values of the symbols are substituted I. It thus appears , as far as the calculation has been carried , that r COS co there are no terms in the expansion of r-except such -as contain the mean motions and are periodical .
3 .
We next proceed to the expansion of , which is the ore difficult part of the problem .
The value of cos w , already investigated , may be thus written , cos C= cos ( ( ( '+ a C ' ) sin2 I. cos((-'-'+-')cos(qp+(p'++a-'-2v ) }* The coefficient is equal to zero , because a(i ) = ) : and for the same reason the coefficient A( ) a(1 ) B(1 ) b(l ) B(z ) a( ) _ b( ) A(1 ) 4+4 is equal to zero .

By substituting a ( 1 s ) and a ' ( 1 s ' ) for r and r ' we get 11D= ~ja2 ( s)2 + a'2 ( 1 aa '(1S)( s ' ) cos ( '+ -( - ) ' and it will be found that the following equation , in partial differentials , is true , viz. d. d.1Dds ( 1-s ) ' ( 1-s ) D-^^+OdsAll the possible values of in this equation are comprehended in the formula , D -=G X F ; provided F and G verify these equations , dG dG dF d( sFo = s7 ?
dS* ( 1o-s ) + cs2 ( -s ' ) .
We may adopt for G any particular expression which verifies its proper equation ; and then F will be determined by the nature of the quantity sought .
Any function of ( 1 s ) and ( 1 s ' ) of 1 dimension will verify the equation for G ; and , taking the most simple case , G =1 -_ , we shall have D-1 l -D , = l =F .
568 Now let Do = ^a2 +a !
2 2a a'cos(+a ) then first , if we suppose s= 0 , s ' = O , we get D -= Do ; and again , if we suppose s= s ' , the result will be , ___ _i 111 D ' 1 -s I)o and thus we learn that F= Do ' both when s= 0 , s ' = 0 , and when s s ' .
From its equation we know that F must be a function of no dimensions with respect to ( 1 s ) and ( 1 s ' ) ; and this condition , as well as what has been shown to take place on the two foregoing suppositions , will be fulfilled by making Fa function of ( _ ) = 1 : wherefore the expression of i will be as follows : D l--\lIs s J1 .

If it be observed that , in every term , the exponent of the power of s ' is the same with the numeral affix of B , and the exponent of s the same with the index of A , it will appear that the whole expansion is conmprehended in the formula , AB s ' s , it i VA " i/ being the coefficient of s ' s in ( s ' s ) , and i ' , i , representing the several positive numbers , zero included , of which the sum ( i ' + i ) does not exceed 5 , when the expansion is limited to quantities of the fifth order .

The problem to be solved is , to expand Din a series of terms arranged according to the cosines of the arc 4 , or ( '+a - ' , and its successive 1f multiples .
Now as the quantities D and 3and their differentials , are all susceptible of a like development , what is required will be accomplished merely by substituting in B ) , B( , &amp;c. , the parts of D D3 , and their differentials , multiplied by the cosine of the same multiple of x4/ , instead of the quantities themselves .
The coefficients of the cosines in the developments in a at question are functions of ai or aand , for the sake of convergency , we must choose that one of the two fractions which is less than unit .
Supposing that a ' is greater than a , and that n represents any odd number , we have , n--1 tz-1 / , -1\a-fXE2\ 2 a. .

Although all the coefficients are supposed to be deduced from six of them , for which alone direct expressions are given , it is nevertheless obvious that an independent formula may be found by which any proposed coefficient may be ( k ) ( k ) separately computed : namely , by substituting the values of bo , , &amp;c. , in the expressions of the several finite differences .
Although there can be no difficulty in applying the formulas , it may not be improper , for the sake of illustration , to take an example .
We shall choose the instance of Venus and the Earth .
In this case a ' will represent the mean distance of the Earth , and a that of Venus : wherefore , a aa =_ 0'7323332 = tan 0 , 0 71 ? ?

which is accomplished by rules amply detailed in all the treatises on Physical Astrionomy .
We next deduce the value of a(k ) , viz. )= ( 2 k+ 1 ) ( C(/ ) sin + 579 and , with the numbers thus found , we have generally for any proposed value of k , ( k ) ( k ) b , ( k ) C(k ) +-159736 .

a Nothing can be more easy than the computation of these six quantities for any assigned value of k. The other quantities , being the several orders of the finite differences of the first six , will be known when these have been computed : but it will be convenient and will often save much calculation to have an independent formula for every coefficient separately .

a. According to these formulas the calculation of any of the coefficienlts is an easy arithmetical process .
In order to be able to compute , in any term of the expansion of D , the part of any proposed order with respect to e and e , nothing more is wanting than a method for reducing ~ , i , s ' s cos '+f ) to a series of simple cosines .
On this point some observations will be offered below : but , without proceeding further , there is no difficulty in this respect , when we confine our views to quantities not passing the second or third order , which comprehends all the perturbations useful in astronomy , except the inequalities of very long periods .
If we combine the planets two and two , as is done in the sixth chapter of the sixth book of the M6canique C6leste , and for every two planets construct a formula such as is exhibited above for Venus and the Earth , limiiting the extent of the calculation according to the nature of the case , the theory of the planetary disturbances would be rendered more accessible , and would be freed from the tedious and disgusting labour which has rendered astronomers averse from cultivating this branch of their science .

The expression , / s cos k ( + o ' ) may be reduced to this form , cos k ( p ' ) .
{ ( s cos k ) ( s ' cos k d ) + ( s sin k ) ( s/ sin k a ' ) -sin k ( p - ' ) .
{ ( s sink ) co k o ) ( cos k ) ( s ' sin k a ) Here the quantities within the brackets are serieses , of which each contains the mean anomaly of only one planet , and comes under one or other of eleven different forms , namely , the six , cos k , scos k a , s2coska , ... .
5coska , and the five , sin k a , s sin k , s2 sin k a , ... ... .
sin k a , the quantity s5 sin k a , which is of the sixth order , being omitted .
None of these serieses , when carried to quantities of the fifth order inclusively , and arranged according to the sines and cosines of the multiples of the mean anomaly , contain more than six terms , and they thus afford a ready way of calculating the part of sI cos k ( + f -a ) of any proposed order with respect to e and e ' .
These serieses are as follow : Cos k=(l-k2e2 k2e4+ -e ) 5 k2 e2 + k2 e4y k4 4).e os 4 ?

If we wish to determine all the arguments of the order ee in the term multiplied by cos k ( p '+ i ' ) , of the development of , x and x ' representing two positive integer numbers , zero included , of which the sum does not exceed 5 ; we first set aside all the parts of the expression in which i is greater than x , or i ' greater than x , for these contain no quantities of the order e e ' .
Let A b( X s3 s ' cos k(+i i ' ) be one of the remaining parts , in which i is not greater than x , nor i ' greater zx than ' ; in the serieses s cos k &lt; and s sin k a , take the terms Ae cos xp and 'i i ' xI Be sin x t ; and , in s cos k a ' and s ' sin k e , take the terms A ' e ' cos x ' and B ' e ' sin x ' ; then all the arguments of the order e e ' will be contained in the formula i ( k ) xvA b. X 3e e ' X cos k( ' ) .
{ A Acos Acos x Fb cos X ' p+B B ' in sin sin x ' } sin k ( p { ' ) .
{ A ' B sin xp cos x ' AB'cos xp sin x'pJ ' } And thus are computed all the quantities of the order ex e ' in any term of the development of D. The procedure is exactly the same with that followed in the expansion of the first part of the disturbing function in ? ?
2 .
All the arguments of the order e " e ' " are only four , comprehended in the formula k( x_ ) 4+ x'_ , which represents all the different ways of combining xp and x ' p ' by addition and subtraction , with k ( p p ' ) .
Hence it is easy to ascertain the orders of the same argument , or the relative magnitude of its coefficients , as it recurs in different terms of the development of A. 7 .
We have next to consider the parts of the disturbing function which depend on the inclination of the orbits .
